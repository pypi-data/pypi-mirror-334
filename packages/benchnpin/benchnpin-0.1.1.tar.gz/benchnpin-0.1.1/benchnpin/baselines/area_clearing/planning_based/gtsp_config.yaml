### SHIP MODEL AND CONTROLLER PARAMS
controller:
  dt: 0.8  # the ship dynamics model was discretized with this dt (originally 0.02)
  # States: [r, u, v] : yaw rate (deg/s), surge velocity (m/s), sway velocity (m/s)
  A:
    - [ 0.9909, 0., 0. ]
    - [ 0., 0.9980, 0. ]
    - [ 0., 0., 0.9953 ]
  # Input matrix: differential fore/aft (rps), side tunnel (rps), main prop (rps) (Assume pure motions)
  B: [ 0.04515, 4.321e-5, 1.730e-4 ]
  # Input limits
  # To calculate yaw rate given min turn radius r and surge velocity v
  # 360 / ((2 pi r) / v)
  input_lims: [8.6, 0.5, 0.05]
  # look ahead distance
  Lfc: 0.5
  # target speed
  target_speed: 0.2  # m/s
  PID_gains:  # gains for 3 PIDs
