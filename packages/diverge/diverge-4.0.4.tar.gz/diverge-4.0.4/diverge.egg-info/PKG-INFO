DIVERGE 4.0 is a comprehensive software package for detecting functional divergence in protein family evolution. 
    It implements various statistical methods to identify amino acid sites that have undergone functional divergence, 
    including Type-I and Type-II functional divergence. This package is an essential tool for researchers 
    in evolutionary biology, bioinformatics, and computational biology.
