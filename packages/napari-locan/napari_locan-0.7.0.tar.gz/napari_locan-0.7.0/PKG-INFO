Load, visualize and analyze single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data.

napari-locan is a napari plugin that implements a subset of methods from [locan],
a python-based library with code for analyzing SMLM data.
Locan provides extended functionality that is better suited for script- or
notebook-based analysis procedures.
napari-locan is well suited for exploratory data analysis within napari.

For details on usage and development of napari-locan please read the [documentation].

## Installation

Make sure to have Qt bindings installed in your python environment of choice.

You can install napari-locan from PyPI:

    pip install napari-locan
