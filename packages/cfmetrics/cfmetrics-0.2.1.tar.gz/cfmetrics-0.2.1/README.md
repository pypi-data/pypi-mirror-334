# Cloudflare Analytics – Because You Need More Graphs 📊


Ever wondered what Cloudflare *thinks* is happening on your website? This incredibly "advanced" tool helps you fetch analytics data using Cloudflare's GraphQL API—because who doesn’t love GraphQL, right? Now you can *almost* understand your website traffic, security threats, and performance (with a pinch of optimism).

## 🚀 Features (Because Everything Needs Bullet Points)

- 📊 Pulls data straight from Cloudflare's GraphQL API (yes, GraphQL, because REST is *so* last decade)
- 🔍 Gives you traffic insights, but *only* if Cloudflare decides to cooperate
- 📈 Shows security metrics—so you can see all those "bad" IPs doing "bad" things
- ⚡ Lightweight, just like your trust in Cloudflare’s analytics

## 📦 Installation (Because Nothing is Easy)

Clone this glorified data-fetcher and install some dependencies:

```sh
# Clone the magical repo
git clone https://github.com/k1m0ch1/cloudflare-analytics.git
cd cloudflare-analytics

# Install the spell components
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔧 Configuration (Enter Your API Token… If You Dare)

Create a `.env` file and provide your *oh-so-secure* Cloudflare API token:

```sh
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
```

If your token gets leaked, don’t worry—Cloudflare probably already knew about it.

## 🚀 Usage (Let’s See What Cloudflare *Wants* You to See)

Run this beauty and behold the data:

```sh
python analytics.py
```

Example output (or an error message, who knows?):

```
Fetching Cloudflare analytics data...
Total Requests: 120,345 (or whatever Cloudflare decides)
Unique Visitors: 54,678 (probably bots)
Threats Blocked: 1,234 (but not that one shady IP)
...
```

## 🛠 API Reference (A.k.a. "Read the Docs")

This tool "leverages" Cloudflare’s GraphQL API, which you can tweak in `analytics.py`. Or just pretend you understand GraphQL by checking out [Cloudflare’s GraphQL API Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/graphql/).

## 📜 License (Because Lawyers Demand It)

This project is licensed under the MIT License—so do whatever you want with it. Just don’t blame us if Cloudflare changes everything overnight.

## 🤝 Contributing (No, Really, Please Help)

Want to make this better? Great! Open an issue, submit a pull request, or just scream into the void.
