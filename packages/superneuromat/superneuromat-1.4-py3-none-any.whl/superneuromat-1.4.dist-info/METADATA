# SuperNeuroMAT v1.4

SuperNeuroMAT is a matrix-based simulator for simulating spiking neural networks to be used in neuromorphic computing.

Documentation available at: https://superneuromat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


## Installation
1. Install using `pip install superneuromat`
2. Update/upgrade using `pip install superneuromat --upgrade`


## Usage
1. In a Python script or on a Python interpreter, do `import superneuromat as snm`
2. The main class can be accessed by `model = snm.NeuromorphicModel()`
3. Refer to docstrings in the source code for the API


## For Development
1. Clone the `superneuromat` repo: `git clone https://github.com/ORNL/superneuromat.git`
2. Add the path to `superneuromat` to your `$PYTHONPATH`: `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/superneuromat`. 
3. You may want to update the `$PYTHONPATH` in your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`.


## Directory Info
