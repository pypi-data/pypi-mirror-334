        be used.

        ==========
        filepath (string)

            is True, triggers different admin tasks and the window
            manager is used as the loop holder. That is, when closing
            a file, only the window manager in 'no_file' mode is shown.

        Future implementation
        =====================

        in the future, the splash screen should be shown
        first, while the window prepares for a new session,
        and only then we will decide whether it will be
        kept on the screen or not.
