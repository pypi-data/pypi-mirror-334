Please, make sure regular pygame is uninstalled and pygame-ce (pygame community edition) is installed in the Python instance running Nodezator by executing the following commands:

pip uninstall pygame
pip install pygame-ce --upgrade

This is needed because Nodezator is only useable with pygame-ce due to exclusive imports.
