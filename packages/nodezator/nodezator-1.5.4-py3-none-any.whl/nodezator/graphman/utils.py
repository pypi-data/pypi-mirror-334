### function to perform call with custom syntaxes
### according to their parameters (or lack thereof)

# obtain a string formatter callable which simulates
# a call
format_as_call = "callable_obj({})".format

## main function


def lay_arguments_and_execute(callable_obj, argument_map, signature_obj):
    """Lay arguments, execute callable and return result.

    Works by building a string representing a call to the
    received callable with all its arguments laid out
    properly according to the kind of the corresponding
    parameters.

    Such string is then, executed with the builtin function
    eval() and its return value is returned from this
    function.

    Such kinds of parameters refer to whether a parameter
    is positional-only, keyword-only, both positional
    and keyword compatible, etc., for instance. They are
    listed in the following attributes of the standard
    library inspect module:

    '_POSITIONAL_ONLY',
    '_POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD',
    '_KEYWORD_ONLY',
    '_VAR_POSITIONAL'
    '_VAR_KEYWORD'.

    If a parameter is of kind inspect._KEYWORD_ONLY, for
    instance, the string will be built so that its
    argument is passed as a keyword in the call.

    Note that instead of obtaining the signature from
    the callable itself we chose to receive it as an
    argument. This is so because we speed up the function
    by eliminating the step of obtaining the signature and
    this also enable us to use a different signature for
    the given callable, as long as it is compatible with
    the callable.


    Parameters
    ==========

    callable_obj (callable)
        callable to be executed.

    argument_map  (dict)
        has values for the parameters, to use in the call.

    signature_obj (obj returned from inspect.signature())
        object returned from passing the callable object
        to the inspect.signature() function; it is used
        to obtain information about the parameters (or lack
        thereof) of the callable.
