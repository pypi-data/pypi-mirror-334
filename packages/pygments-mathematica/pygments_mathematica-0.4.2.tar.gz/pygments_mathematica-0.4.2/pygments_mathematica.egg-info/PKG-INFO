This is the most up-to-date lexer and highlighter for Mathematica/Wolfram Language source code using the pygments engine.

It currently supports:

 - All builtin functions in the ``System`` context including unicode symbols like ``π`` except  those that use characters from the private unicode space (e.g. ``\[FormalA]``).
 - User defined symbols, including those in a context.
 - All operators including unicode operators like ``∈`` and ``⊕``.
 - Comments, including multi line and nested.
 - Strings, including multi line and escaped quotes.
 - Patterns, slots (including named slots ``#name`` introduced in version 10) and slot sequences.
 - Message names (e.g. the ivar in ``General::ivar``)
 - Numbers including base notation (e.g. ``8 ^^ 23 == 19``) and scientific notation  (e.g. ``1 *^ 3 == 1000``).
 - Local variables in ``Block``, ``With`` and ``Module``.

A Sass file containing the styles can be obtained from the package repository for use in static website generators such as Jekyll, Octopress, Pelican, etc.
