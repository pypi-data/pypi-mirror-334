    I'm studying the following {random_word} flowers and would like you to simply count how many flowers are in this list:
    
    1. Rose - A classic flower known for its beauty and fragrance. Roses come in many colors, each with its own symbolism. They are often used in perfumes, cosmetics, and culinary applications.
    2. Tulip - A spring flower with cup-shaped blooms. Tulips originated in Turkey and became famously valuable during the Dutch "tulip mania" of the 17th century.
    3. Lily - Elegant flowers with distinct petals and strong fragrance. Lilies are often associated with purity and are popular in religious ceremonies and weddings.
    4. Sunflower - Tall flowers with bright yellow petals and dark centers. Sunflowers are known for their heliotropic behavior, where they turn to face the sun throughout the day.
    5. Daisy - Simple flowers with white petals and yellow centers. Daisies symbolize innocence and are among the oldest known flowering plants.
    6. Orchid - Exotic flowers with complex shapes and vibrant colors. There are over 28,000 species of orchids, making them one of the largest flowering plant families.
    7. Carnation - Ruffled flowers available in many colors. Carnations have been cultivated for over 2,000 years and are often used in boutonnieres and corsages.
    8. Chrysanthemum - Fall blooming flowers with many petals. Chrysanthemums are highly valued in Asian cultures and are one of the "Four Gentlemen" in Chinese art.
    9. Daffodil - Spring flowers with trumpet-shaped centers. Daffodils symbolize rebirth and new beginnings, and are often the first flowers to bloom after winter.
    10. Peony - Lush, full flowers with rounded shape. Peonies are known for their exquisite beauty and are considered a symbol of prosperity in many cultures.
    11. Dahlia - Flowers with geometric petal arrangements. Dahlias are native to Mexico and were named after the Swedish botanist Anders Dahl.
    12. Iris - Flowers with distinctive three-part blooms. The iris is named after the Greek goddess of the rainbow and comes in nearly every color.
    13. Poppy - Delicate flowers with paper-like petals. Poppies are known for their medicinal properties and have become a symbol of remembrance for war veterans.
    14. Marigold - Bright orange and yellow flowers. Marigolds are often used in Day of the Dead celebrations and have natural pest-repellent properties.
    15. Lavender - Purple flower spikes with aromatic properties. Lavender is widely used in aromatherapy and is known for its calming effects.
    16. Hydrangea - Large clusters of small flowers. Hydrangea colors can change based on soil pH, with acidic soil producing blue flowers and alkaline soil producing pink flowers.
    17. Snapdragon - Flowers with unique mouth-like shape. When the sides of a snapdragon flower are squeezed, the "mouth" opens and closes, resembling a dragon's jaw.
    18. Violet - Small purple flowers with heart-shaped leaves. Violets have been used in perfumes, candies, and medicinal remedies for centuries.
    19. Zinnia - Bright, round flowers in many colors. Zinnias are named after the German botanist Johann Gottfried Zinn and are known for their long-lasting blooms.
    20. Geranium - Clusters of small flowers with distinctive leaves. Geraniums are popular in window boxes and hanging baskets due to their drought tolerance and continuous blooming.
    21. Amaryllis - Striking trumpet-shaped flowers on tall stalks. Amaryllis bulbs are popular gifts during winter holidays and can be forced to bloom indoors.
    22. Anemone - Delicate flowers with paper-thin petals. Also known as windflowers, anemones come in various colors and bloom in spring and fall.
    23. Aster - Daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer and fall. The name comes from the Greek word for "star" due to their star-shaped flower heads.
    24. Begonia - Flowers with waxy petals and colorful foliage. Begonias are versatile plants that can be grown as annuals, perennials, or houseplants.
    25. Bleeding Heart - Heart-shaped pink or white flowers on arching stems. The unique shape makes it a favorite in shade gardens.
    26. Bluebell - Bell-shaped blue flowers that often carpet woodland floors in spring. They're protected in many countries due to their cultural significance.
    27. Buttercup - Glossy yellow flowers with a distinctive cup shape. Their shiny petals reflect light, creating the illusion they're glowing.
    28. Calendula - Bright orange and yellow daisy-like flowers. Also known as pot marigold, calendula has medicinal properties and is used in skincare.
    29. Camellia - Flowers with perfect symmetry and glossy leaves. Camellias bloom in winter and early spring when few other plants are flowering.
    30. Clematis - Climbing vines with star-shaped flowers. With over 300 species, clematis comes in various colors and sizes.
    
    Please count the total number of flowers in this list and respond with just the number.
