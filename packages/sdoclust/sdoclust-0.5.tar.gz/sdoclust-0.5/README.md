Sparse Data Observers (**SDO**) is an unsupervised learning
approach developed to cover the need for fast, highly interpretable and
intuitively parameterizable anomaly detection. Its extension, **SDOclust**, 
performs clustering while preserving the simplicity and applicability of the original approach. 

SDO and SDOclust are powerful options when statistical estimates
are representative and feature spaces conform distance-based analysis.
Their main characteristics are: lightweight, intuitive, self-adjusted, noise-
resistant, able to extract non-convex clusters (SDOclust), and built on robust 
parameters and interpretable models. 

Feasibility and rapid integration into real-world applications are the core goals 
behind SDO and SDOclust, which can work on most data scenarios without parameter 
adjustment (simply using the default parameterization).

## Installation and dependecies

sdo can be installed from PyPI using

        pip install sdoclust

or directly from our GitHub repository:

        pip install git+https://github.com/CN-TU/pysdoclust

sdo requires de following packages:

- numpy
- math
- scipy
- sklearn

By default, SDO uses distance.cdist (from the scipy package) for calculating point distances and distance matrices (no-method or method="brute"). Instead, you can use approximate neighbor search with:

- [FAISS](https://pypi.org/project/faiss-cpu/)
- [pyNNdescent](https://pypi.org/project/pynndescent/)
  
Then you will need to install these packages if calling SDO or SDOclust with method="faiss" or method="pynndescent", e.g.:

        import sdoclust as sdo
        mdl = sdo.SDO(method='faiss')

However, note that the dominant factor in searching is the set of observers *O*, which is typically within a few hundred to a few thousand data points. This means that the default "brute" method is going to obtain equivalent runtimes to "faiss" or "pynndescent" and, in principle, better accuracy. Therefore, these alternatives are suitable when setting pretty large values of *k* (which is usually not necessary).

## Examples of usage

## SDO

        import numpy as np
        np.random.seed(1)

        # Generate data
        from sklearn import datasets
        x, y = datasets.make_circles(n_samples=5000, factor=0.3, noise=0.1)

        # SDO outlier scoring
        import sdoclust as sdo
        s = sdo.SDO().fit_predict(x)

        # plotting results
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        fig = plt.figure()
        plt.scatter(x[:,0],x[:,1], s=10, cmap='coolwarm', c=s)
        plt.colorbar(ticks=[np.min(s), np.max(s)])
        plt.title('SDO outlierness scores')
        plt.show()

## SDOclust

        import numpy as np
        np.random.seed(1)

        # Generate data
        from sklearn import datasets
        x, y = datasets.make_circles(n_samples=5000, factor=0.3, noise=0.1)

        # SDOclust clustering
        import sdoclust as sdo
        p = sdo.SDOclust().fit_predict(x)

        # plotting results
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        fig = plt.figure()
        plt.scatter(x[:,0],x[:,1], s=10, cmap='coolwarm', c=p)
        plt.title('SDOclust clustering')
        plt.show()

## Application notes

SDO and SDOclust obtain good performances without modifying the default parameterization in most applications, but may require adjustment in some cases: typically, when datasets have very few elements, when clusters are overlapping or in cases with many under-represented clusters. 

Main SDO parameters are:

- *x*, which establishes the number of closest observers to evaluate each data point.
- *qv*, which sets a robust threshold for removing *idle* observers.
- *k*, which fixes de number of observers in the model

        mdl = sdo.SDO(x=5, qv=0.3, k=500)

Additionally, SDOclust also incorporates:


- *zeta*, which sets a trade-off between locality and globality for cutting-off graph edges thresholds.
- *chi*, which defines the *chi*-closest observer of any given observer to decide cutting-off graph edges thresholds.
- *e* sets the minimum number of observers that a cluster can have.

        mdl = sdo.SDOclust(zeta=0.6, chi=10, e=3)

[1] and [2] provide further explanations on SDO and SDOclust parameters.
Particularly for SDOclust, remember that default parameters tend to find the fundamental partitions, i.e. a low number of clusters. If your scenario contains many clusters, or you detect underclustering, try, for example, to increase *k* and/or reduce *chi*.
