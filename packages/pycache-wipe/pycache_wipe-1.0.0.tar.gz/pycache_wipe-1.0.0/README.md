# pycache-wipe

**pycache-wipe** is a lightweight, production-ready Python utility that helps you keep your project directories clean by safely and efficiently deleting all `__pycache__` folders.

These `__pycache__` folders are generated automatically by Python to store bytecode-compiled files. Over time, they can clutter your workspace and may not be necessary to keep in production or deployment environments.
