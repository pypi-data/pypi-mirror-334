# azc - LLM Chat from the command-line

A command-line tool for interacting with LLMs.



# Why should you use this?

- If you're a command-line junkie, you don't need to switch to another tool to chat with your LLM
- One tool, multiple LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Gemini...) - Why settle for one when you can have them all?
- Pay-as-you-go pricing for LLM providers (Cheaper in many cases)

# Features

- Multi-provider support
  - Ollama
  - OpenAI
  - Anthropic
  - Gemini
  - Grok
- Streaming responses (see response as it is being generated)
- Persistent command-line history (use up and down arrows to navigate)
- Chat history & reset (full discussion, start new chat)
- Switch provider and model (compare models and providers)
- Markdown output (nicely formatted headings, lists, tables, etc.)
- Command-line parameters (first prompt)

# Possible future features

- Support more LLM providers (Perplexity, Groq...)
- Support RTL languages
- Save output to file
- Patterns library (a-la fabric)
- Upload files
- Aggregate responses from multiple providers
- Support more modes (image generation, transcription, etc.)
- Track total cost of API calls
- Add to homebrew

# Installation

    pip install azc

if you want to make it available system-wide (without having to activate your python environment or cd to the project folder), you can install it system-wide:

    echo 'alias azc="$HOME/projects/azc/env/bin/azc"' >> ~/.bashrc

- Replace `~/.bashrc` with the shell you are using (zsh, bash, etc.)
- Replace `$HOME/projects/azc/env/bin/azc` with the path to the azc executable
- On Windows, you can add the path to your PATH environment variable (ask your nearest LLM for more details)

You can also build an executable and place it in a central location using pyinstaller.
I am using `build_exe.sh` to do this on my mac. It installs the `az` command

# Running

    % azc
    azc> how tall is the eiffel tower?
                                      ollama:llama3.1:latest (1st message)
      The Eiffel Tower stands at an impressive height of:

      • 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall, including its antenna.
      • 302.9 meters (994.7 feet) tall, excluding its antenna.

      It was the world's tallest man-made structure when it was first built for the 1889 World's Fair in
      Paris.

    azc> q
    👋 Bye
    %

You can specify the first prompt as a command-line argument:

    % azc -b "What is the capital of Panama?"
    The capital of Panama is Panama City.
    %

# Setup

You will need to configure at least one LLM API.

You should create a `.env` file which contains your API Key/s.
The `.env` file should be located in home directory, either directly under `$HOME` or under `$HOME/.config/`, the latter taking precedence.
See `.env.sample` for a sample `.env` file, with the expected environment variables' names. Remove those that are not relevant to you.

Here are the links to the API sign-up pages (or download in case of Ollama):

- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
- [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
- [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs)
- [Grok](https://docs.x.ai/api/integrations)

You can configure the default models you want to use in `azc_config.json`.
This file is expected to be found under `~/.config/azc_config.json` or `~/.azc_config.json` if you don't have a `~/.config` folder.

# Limitations

- Streaming updates are limited to screen height (after that it displays ellipsis and will update the display only when the response is complete)
- No support for RTL languages
