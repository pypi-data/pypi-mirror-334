Scripts
=======

This folder contains various scripts that are used during the development and
testing of PyImgur. They are included here as they provide fully functional
programs that utilize PyImgur. They are available within the repository, but
not in the compressed files on PyPi. Changes made to scripts within this folder
will not appear in the changelog.

Authentication
--------------

The authentication details for these scripts are located in a file called
`authentication.py` and located within this folder. For security reasons it is
not included in the repository. The dummy file `dummy_authentication.py`
illustrates the contents of the authentication file and is included in the
repository.
