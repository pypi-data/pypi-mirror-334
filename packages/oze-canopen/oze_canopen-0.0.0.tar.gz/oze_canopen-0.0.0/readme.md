# oze_canopen
CanOpen library for Rust. It is not implementing Object Dictionary and designed to work as sniffer or master node.

## Features
- Fully async using tokio and socketcan-rs
- All packets type parsing based on COB ID
- Node ID parsing
- Async mutex-protected SDO client for every node
- NMT & SYNC servers with possibility to send packages periodically
- Parallel receiver & transmitter to ensure non blocking access

# Roadmap
- Implement CAN FD support
- nostd for using on MCU

# SDO example
```rust
// init and start receiver, transmitter and interface monitor
let (interface, mut handles) = canopen::start(String::from("vcan0"), Some(100000));
 // wait for connection
sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
// get SDO client for nodeID=4
let sdo_client = interface.get_sdo_client(4).unwrap();
// because only single SDO request is supported then we guard acces using mutex and now we wait to aquire access
let sdo_client = sdo_client.lock().await;
// Send SDO request upload request and wait for result
let result = sdo_client.upload(0x2110, 0x01).await.unwrap();
// print result
println!("{result:?}");
// Gracefully close canopen stack and join all spawned futures
handles.close_and_join().await;
```

More examples you can find in `examples/` directory.

# Testing
Unit tests are in `src/` and has no external requirements, you can run it using `cargo test`.

Integration tests are in `tests/`. To run it successfully you need:
1. Create virtual CAN interface:
- `sudo modprobe vcan`
- `sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan`
- `sudo ip link set up vcan0`
2. Clone and build CanOpenNode demo from here: https://github.com/CANopenNode/CANopenDemo/tree/b2a6b53c2c9d7b74e6ab4c4dcefc2be43533392e/demo
3. Run `./demoLinuxDevice vcan0`
4. Run `cargo test -- --test-threads 1`

After that you can check code coverage using `cargo tarpaulin -j 1 --engine llvm`
