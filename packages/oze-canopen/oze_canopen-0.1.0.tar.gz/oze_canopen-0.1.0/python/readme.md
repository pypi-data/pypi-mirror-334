# oze_canopen
Python bindings for [oze-canopen](https://github.com/ozontech/oze-canopen) library for Rust. It is not implementing Object Dictionary and designed to work as sniffer or master node.

## Features
- Fully async using tokio and socketcan-rs
- All packets type parsing based on COB ID
- Node ID parsing
- Async mutex-protected SDO client for every node
- NMT & SYNC servers with possibility to send packages periodically
- Parallel receiver & transmitter to ensure non blocking access

# SDO example
```rust
import asyncio
import time

import oze_canopen

async def f():
    a = await oze_canopen.OzeCO.start("vcan0", 100000)
    res = await a.sdo_upload(4, 0x1800, 0)
    print(res)
    await a.sdo_download(4, 0x2110, 1, b"\xff\x12\x13\x11")
    res = await a.sdo_upload(4, 0x2110, 1)
    print(res)

asyncio.run(f())
```
