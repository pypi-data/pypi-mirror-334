## Usage

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    make install
    ```

2.  **Start the Backend and Frontend:**

    **Backend:**
    ```bash
    make backend
    ```
    
    The backend will be ready when you see `INFO:     Application startup complete.` in the console.

    <details>
    <summary><b>Click here if you want to use AI Studio and API Key instead of Vertex AI:</b></summary>

    ```bash
    export VERTEXAI=false
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
    ```

    </details>
    <br>
    
    **Frontend:**
    ```bash
    # In a different shell
    make ui
    ```

    This is the suggested mode for development as it allows you to see changes in real-time.

3.  **Interact with the Agent**
    Once both the backend and frontend are running, click the play button in the frontend UI to establish a connection with the backend. You can now interact with the Multimodal Live Agent! You can try asking questions such as "Using the tool you have, define Governance in the context MLOPs" to allow the agent to use the documentation it was provided to.

**Remote access**:
Use [Cloud Run proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/run/services/proxy) for local access. The backend will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`:

   ```bash
   gcloud run services proxy genai-app-sample --port 8000 --project $PROJECT_ID --region $REGION
   ```

   You can then use the same frontend setup described above to interact with your Cloud Run deployment.

<details>
<summary><b>Cloud Shell usage</b></summary>

To use the `multimodal_live_api` agent in Cloud Shell, follow these steps:

1.  **Start the Frontend:**

    ```bash
    make ui
    ```

    You may be prompted to run the app on a different port if port 3000 is in use. Accept by pressing Enter. You'll see a message similar to:

    ```
    You can now view multimodal-live-api-web-console in the browser.

      Local:            http://localhost:3001
      On Your Network:  http://10.88.0.4:3001
    ```

    Click the `localhost` link to open a web preview in Cloud Shell.

2.  **Start the Backend:**

    Open a *new* Cloud Shell terminal tab. Remember to set your Cloud Platform project in this new session using `gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]`. Then from the root of the repository, run:

    ```bash
    make backend
    ```

3.  **Configure Web Preview for the Backend:**

    Trigger a web preview for port 8000 - you'll need to change the default port which is `8080`.  See [Cloud Shell Web Preview documentation](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/using-web-preview#preview_the_application) for details.

4.  **Connect Frontend to Backend:**

    *   The web preview will open a new tab in your browser. Copy the URL from the address bar (e.g., `https://8000-cs-8a3189b8-5295-4085-9893-c318f1724456.ql-europe-west1-ojep.cloudshell.dev/?authuser=0`).
    *   Return to the frontend preview tab (from step 1).
    *   Paste the copied URL into the frontend's "Server URL" connection settings.
    *   Click the "Play button" to connect. Start interacting with it!

*   When using Cloud Shell there is a known limitation when using the feedback feature in the Frontend. Feedback submission might fail due to different origins between the frontend and backend in the Cloud Shell environment.

## Usage

1. **Prototype:** Build your Generative AI Agent using the intro notebooks in `notebooks/` for guidance. Use Vertex AI Evaluation to assess performance.
2. **Integrate:** Import your chain into the app by editing `app/agent.py`.
3. **Test:** Explore your chain's functionality using the Streamlit playground with `make playground`. The playground offers features like chat history, user feedback, and various input types, and automatically reloads your agent on code changes.
4. **Deploy:** Configure and trigger the CI/CD pipelines, editing tests if needed. See the [deployment section](#deployment) for details.
5. **Monitor:** Track performance and gather insights using Cloud Logging, Tracing, and the Looker Studio dashboard to iterate on your application.

## Deployment

### Dev Environment

{%- if cookiecutter.deployment_target == 'agent_engine' %}
You can test deployment towards a Dev Environment using the following command:

```bash
gcloud config set project <your-dev-project-id>
make backend
```
{%- endif %}

The repository includes a Terraform configuration for the setup of the Dev Google Cloud project.
See [deployment/README.md](deployment/README.md) for instructions.

### Production Deployment

The repository includes a Terraform configuration for the setup of a production Google Cloud project. Refer to [deployment/README.md](deployment/README.md) for detailed instructions on how to deploy the infrastructure and application.

## Monitoring and Observability

>> You can use [this Looker Studio dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/c/reporting/fa742264-4b4b-4c56-81e6-a667dd0f853f/page/tEnnC) template for visualizing events being logged in BigQuery. See the "Setup Instructions" tab to getting started.

The application uses OpenTelemetry for comprehensive observability with all events being sent to Google Cloud Trace and Logging for monitoring and to BigQuery for long term storage.
