Assalamu alaikum! My name is Ansari. I can help you with your questions about Islam. 

Ask me about: 

- Dua to make in particular situation
- Spiritual remedies for challenges you are facing
- Islamic perspectives on topics

But I still get things wrong sometimes. It is always best to consult a real Islamic Scholar.
