# AI Payment Agent SDK

A Python SDK for AI agents to make payments on merchant websites that support the AI payment protocol.

## Installation

```bash
pip install ai-payment-agent
```

## Requirements
* Python 3.7+
* cryptography
* aiohttp
* playwright

## Quick Start

The SDK supports two integration methods:
1. Direct payment flow
2. Webhook-based payment flow

### Direct Payment Flow

```python
import asyncio
from ai_payment_agent import AgentPaymentClient

# Replace with your RSA private key
PRIVATE_KEY = """-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"""

async def main():
    # Initialize the payment client
    client = AgentPaymentClient(
        agent_id="YOUR_AGENT_ID",
        private_key_pem=PRIVATE_KEY,
        payment_gateway_url="https://payment-gateway.example.com/api"
    )
    
    # Check if a website supports AI payments
    compatibility = await client.check_website_compatibility("https://merchant-example.com")
    
    if compatibility["compatible"]:
        merchant_id = compatibility["merchantId"]
        
        # Initiate a payment
        payment_response = await client.initiate_payment(
            merchant_id=merchant_id,
            amount=19.99,
            currency="USD",
            description="AI-assisted purchase",
            agent_payment_reference="order-12345"
        )
        
        print(f"Payment initiated: {payment_response}")
        
        # Later, complete the payment
        # (usually after merchant website confirmation, i.e. initialization)
        if payment_response:
            success = await client.complete_payment(
                payment_id=payment_response["payment_id"],
                merchant_id=merchant_id,
                encrypted_advice=payment_response["encrypted_advice"],
                secret=payment_response["secret"]
            )
            
            print(f"Payment completed: {success}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Webhook-based Payment Flow

#### Part 1: Check Compatibility and Initiate Payment

```python
import asyncio
from ai_payment_agent import AgentPaymentClient

# Replace with your RSA private key
PRIVATE_KEY = """-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"""

async def start_payment():
    # Initialize the payment client
    client = AgentPaymentClient(
        agent_id="YOUR_AGENT_ID",
        private_key_pem=PRIVATE_KEY,
        payment_gateway_url="https://payment-gateway.example.com/api"
    )
    
    # Check if a website supports AI payments
    compatibility = await client.check_website_compatibility("https://merchant-example.com")
    
    if compatibility["compatible"]:
        merchant_id = compatibility["merchantId"]
        
        # Initiate a payment
        payment_response = await client.initiate_payment(
            merchant_id=merchant_id,
            amount=19.99,
            currency="USD",
            description="AI-assisted purchase",
            agent_payment_reference="order-12345"
        )
        
        print(f"Payment initiated: {payment_response}")
        # Payment completion will be handled by webhook

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(start_payment())
```

#### Part 2: Set Up Webhook for Payment Completion

Implement a webhook endpoint in your server application (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI):

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from ai_payment_agent import AgentPaymentClient

app = Flask(__name__)
client = AgentPaymentClient(
    agent_id="YOUR_AGENT_ID",
    private_key_pem=PRIVATE_KEY,
    payment_gateway_url="https://payment-gateway.example.com/api"
)

@app.route('/webhook/payment', methods=['POST'])
async def payment_webhook():
    data = request.json
    
    if data['status'] == 'initialized':
        # Complete the payment
        success = await client.complete_payment(
            merchant_id=data['merchant_id'],
            payment_id=data['payment_id'],
            encrypted_advice=data['encrypted_advice'],
            secret=data['secret']
        )
        return jsonify({"success": success})
    
    return jsonify({"success": True})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

**Note**: Your webhook URL must be registered with the payment processing backend.

## Bill Payments and Bank Transfers

The SDK also supports bill payments and bank transfers:

```python
# Make a bill payment
bill_result = await client.make_bill_payment(
    merchant_id="MERCHANT_ID",
    parameters={
        "bill_type": "electricity",
        "provider": "NationalGrid",
        "account_number": "1234567890",
        "amount": 50.00,
        "reference": "March2025"
    }
)

# Make a bank transfer
transfer_result = await client.make_transfer(
    merchant_id="MERCHANT_ID",
    parameters={
        "amount": 100.00,
        "recipient": "Jane Doe",
        "bank_name": "Example Bank",
        "account_number": "0987654321",
        "reference": "Invoice #123"
    }
)
```

## API Reference

### `AgentPaymentClient`

The main class for interacting with the payment gateway.

#### Constructor

```python
client = AgentPaymentClient(
    agent_id: str,
    private_key_pem: str,
    payment_gateway_url: str
)
```

#### Methods

* `get_public_key_pem()` - Get the agent's public key in PEM format
* `check_website_compatibility(url: str)` - Check if a website supports AI payments
* `initiate_payment(merchant_id, amount, currency, description, agent_payment_reference)` - Start a payment
* `complete_payment(payment_id, merchant_id, encrypted_advice, secret)` - Complete a payment
* `make_bill_payment(merchant_id, parameters)` - Make a bill payment (utilities, etc.)
* `make_transfer(merchant_id, parameters)` - Make a bank transfer
* `check_initialization_status(agent_payment_reference)` - Check payment status

## Security

This SDK uses RSA public-key cryptography for secure communication with the payment gateway. Ensure that your private key is kept secure and never exposed in client-side code.

## Testing

You can learn how to set up and test this SDK alongside the other 2 components ([payment gateway backend](https://tally.so/r/wvKeg4) and [merchant frontend SDK](https://github.com/ibnahmadcoded/merchant-payment-client)) [here](https://github.com/ibnahmadcoded/agent-pay-intro).
