## 📖 What is FastAPI Cookiecutter?
**FastAPI Cookiecutter** is a badass template for generating production-ready FastAPI projects in minutes. Built for developers who hate boilerplate and love flexibility, it’s packed with:

- 🛠️ **Modular Blueprint**: Pre-structured for APIs, models, and services.
- 🌍 **Database Choices**: PostgreSQL or SQLite, you decide.
- ⚡ **Optional Boosts**: Docker, Redis, CI/CD—pick what you need.
- 🔍 **Pro Tools**: Health checks, migrations, and tests out of the box.

### Why This Template?
- ⚡ **Instant Start**: Zero-to-API faster than you can say "REST".
- 🔧 **Total Control**: Customize with a few quick prompts.
- 🌐 **Scales Hard**: From side projects to enterprise beasts.
- 📊 **Clean Code**: Structure that actually makes sense.
