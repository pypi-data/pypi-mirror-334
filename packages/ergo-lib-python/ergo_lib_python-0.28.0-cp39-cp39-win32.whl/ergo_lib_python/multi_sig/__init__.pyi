"""Multi-signature related classes implemented according to `EIP-11 <https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/blob/9906f403f61d8592ab955494cc4310563f4067c6/eip-0011.md>`_

In Ergo multi-signature requires two stages: the commit stage and signing

Commit Stage
_____________
Signers generate commitments (randomly generated), and share it with other signers until enough commitments are gathered to meet the required number of signers.
When using :py:meth:`ergo_lib_python.wallet.Wallet.generate_commitments` two hints are generated for each input:

- OwnCommitment, which includes private randomness (should not be shared with other signers)
- :py:class:`RealCommitment` which includes the public image of randomness (r * G), where G is the base point of the elliptic curve group

Once enough commitments are gathered (t commitments for a t-of-n signature), signing can begin

Signing Stage
---------------
If the signature is a threshold signature (t-of-n), then for signers who are not present :py:class:`SimulatedCommitment`'s are generated.
Each signer now signs the message/transaction and produces a :py:class:`RealSecretProof`, and :py:class:`SimulatedSecretProof` for signers who are not present
