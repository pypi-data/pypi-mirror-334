This Pelican plugin extracts an image from the summary or content of an article or page if not already specified in content metadata.

Installation
------------

This plugin can be installed via:

    python -m pip install pelican-featured-image

As long as you have not explicitly added a `PLUGINS` setting to your Pelican settings file, then the newly-installed plugin should be automatically detected and enabled. Otherwise, you must add `featured_image` to your existing `PLUGINS` list. For more information, please see the [How to Use Plugins](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/plugins.html#how-to-use-plugins) documentation.

Usage
-----

To override the default behavior of selecting the first image in the article's summary or content, set the image property the article's metadata to the URL of the image to display, e.g:

```markdown
Title: My super title
Date: 2010-12-03 10:20
Category: Python
Tags: pelican, publishing
Slug: my-super-post
Author: Alexis Metaireau
Summary: Short version for index and feeds
Image: /images/my-super-image.png

Article content...
```

### Page

```html
{% if page.featured_image %}
    <img src="{{ page.featured_image }}">
{% endif %}
```

### Article

To include a representative image in an article add the following to the template:
