  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.56287079 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.10766657
  | K-point:     109 at    0.500000    0.500000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.55553944 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.36734463
  | K-point:      26 at    0.000000    0.500000    0.250000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.00733136 eV between HOMO at k-point 109 and LUMO at k-point 26
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.16637190 eV for k_point 95 at    0.000000    0.500000    0.250000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, the gap value is rather small. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is most likely metallic (in the sense that there are states
  at or near the Fermi level). A DOS and/or band structure plot is required
  for an unambiguous distinction.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.22064308 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.99999649
  | K-point:      34 at    0.000000    0.875000    0.625000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  | Occupation number:      0.99890433
  | K-point:     122 at    0.750000    0.250000    0.875000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.03280906 eV between HOMO at k-point 34 and LUMO at k-point 122
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.13782869 eV for k_point 83 at    0.750000    0.250000    0.875000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, the gap value is rather small. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is most likely metallic (in the sense that there are states
  at or near the Fermi level). A DOS and/or band structure plot is required
  for an unambiguous distinction.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.11234674 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.02228401
  | K-point:      45 at    0.250000    0.125000    0.750000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.06701119 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000
  | K-point:      83 at    0.500000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.04533555 eV between HOMO at k-point 45 and LUMO at k-point 83
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.04950149 eV for k_point 122 at    0.500000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, the gap value is rather small. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is most likely metallic (in the sense that there are states
  at or near the Fermi level). A DOS and/or band structure plot is required
  for an unambiguous distinction.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.11234674 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.02228401
  | K-point:      45 at    0.250000    0.125000    0.750000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.06701119 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000
  | K-point:      83 at    0.500000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.04533555 eV between HOMO at k-point 45 and LUMO at k-point 83
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.04950149 eV for k_point 122 at    0.500000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, the gap value is rather small. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is most likely metallic (in the sense that there are states
  at or near the Fermi level). A DOS and/or band structure plot is required
  for an unambiguous distinction.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :        -358734.378240067 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :        -358734.378287400 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

 * A warning was issued further up regarding the CPU load.
   Some CPUs do not participate in the eigenvalue solution.
   In corner cases, this may be the correct behavior. Otherwise,
