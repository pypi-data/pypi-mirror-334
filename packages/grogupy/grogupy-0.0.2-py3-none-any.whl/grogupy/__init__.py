"""grogupy is a package capable of calculating magnetic interactions.

    The main focus is on calculating the parameters of the generalized Heisenberg
    model including the exchange between the pairs and the anisotropy of the
    magnetic entities. This is done by reading in the Hamiltonian to a single
    non-collinear DFT calculation, where the DFT software can be non-orthogonal.
