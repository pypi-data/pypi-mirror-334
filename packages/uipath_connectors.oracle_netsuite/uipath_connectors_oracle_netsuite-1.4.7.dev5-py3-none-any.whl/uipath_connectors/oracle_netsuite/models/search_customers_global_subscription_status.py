        value (Optional[SearchCustomersGlobalSubscriptionStatusGlobalSubscriptionStatusValue]): Email recipients can
            have one of four subscription statuses:    * Confirmed Opt-In - When an email recipient has indicated that they
            want to receive your campaign and bulk merge email, they are assigned this subscription status. Only a recipient
            can set his or her subscription status to Confirmed Opt-In.    * Soft Opt-In - Recipients with this status can
            receive opt-in messages that enable them to confirm whether or not they want to receive your email campaigns as
            well as bulk email.      You can set a recipient’s status to Soft Opt-In manually or through a mass update.    *
            Soft Opt-Out - Recipients with this status cannot receive campaign or bulk email messages but can receive opt-in
            messages.      You can change this subscription status to Soft Opt-In manually or through a mass update.    *
            Confirmed Opt-Out - Only the recipient can set their subscription status to Confirmed Opt-Out.      Recipients
            with this status cannot receive email campaigns, bulk email, or opt-in messages. Recipients with this status can
            only opt in again through the Customer Center or by clicking the link in an email message they have received
            prior to opting out.
