    """
    Attributes:
        accounting_book_detail_list (Optional[SearchItemsAccountingBookDetailList]):
        alternate_demand_source_item (Optional[SearchInventoryItemRecordRef]):
        asset_account (Optional[SearchInventoryItemRecordRef]):
        auto_lead_time (Optional[bool]): Lead time is the average number of days between ordering this item from the
            vendor and receiving it.    * Check the Auto-Calculate box if you want NetSuite to calculate the lead time based
            on the most recent order history of this item. This is calculated by taking the number of days between the order
            entry and receipt on the three most recent purchase orders, and dividing by three.          o If there are
            multiple receipts for the item against the same purchase order, only the first receipt is used for the
            calculation.          o Lead time calculation is not weighted by number of units received.          o More
            recent purchase orders without receipts are ignored.    * Clear the Auto-Calculate box to manually enter a lead
            time value in days. If the Auto-Calculate box is cleared and no value is entered, then the default value from
            the Set Up Inventory Management page is used.
        auto_preferred_stock_level (Optional[bool]): The preferred stock level is the optimum quantity to maintain in
            stock of an item.Set to true if you want NetSuite to calculate the preferred stock level based on demand for the
            item. The preferred stock level is calculated as:    (daily demand * number of days supply preferred)
        auto_reorder_point (Optional[bool]): The Reorder Point is the quantity level at which you need to reorder or
            build more of this item. Set this field to false to manually calculate the point at which to reorder or build
            more of this itemSet this field to true if you want NetSuite to calculate the reorder point based on demand for
            the item over time. The reorder point depends on the safety stock definition and is calculated as
            follows:Without safety stock defined:   Reorder point = (average lead time days * demand)With safety stock
            defined in days:    Reorder point = [(average lead time days + safety stock days) * demand]With safety stock
            quantity defined:    Reorder point = [(average lead time days * demand) + safety stock quantity)
        available_to_partners (Optional[bool]): If true, this item is available in the Advanced Partner Center.
        average_cost (Optional[float]): This field displays the current average cost of the item across all locations.
            Using the weighted-average method, the average cost is calculated as the total units available during a period
            divided by the beginning inventory cost plus the cost of additions to inventory.Note: The average cost
            calculated per location is listed for each location on the Locations subtab.If you use Multiple Units of
            Measure, average cost is calculated using stock units.
        backward_consumption_days (Optional[int]): When you use the Forecast Consumption demand source method, set the
            following:    * Forward Consumption – Number of days after the order date to consider    * Backward Consumption
            – Number of days prior to the order date to considerWhen backward and forward consumption days are entered for
            an item, these fields determine the window, or time period, that is considered for each sales order when a
            forecast amount may be consumed to calculate demand. If an order falls within the consumption window, that order
            quantity is calculated as being consumed and the forecast is adjusted to account for the order consumption.Note:
            NetSuite always considers backward consumption first.  The forecast closest to the order in the backward window
            is consumed first.The forecast closest to the order in the forward window is considered if there are remaining
            quantities to be consumed.Note: Only sales order and invoice quantities can consume forecast quantities. Demand
            from transfer orders and work orders does not consume forecast quantities.

            calculate the last purchase price.When you use the Multiple-Location Inventory feature, the following is true:
            * The last purchase price reflects the most recent transaction at any location.     * The Inventory subtab of

            days between the order entry and receipt on the three most recent purchase orders, and dividing by three. If
            more than three purchase orders exist, all purchase orders within the period specified in the Order Analysis
            Interval field on the Inventory Management Preferences dialog will be used.          o If there are multiple
            receipts for the item against the same purchase order, the calculation is made using the difference between the
            purchase order and the last receipt (the receipt that fully receives the order).          o Lead time
            calculation is not weighted by number of units received.          o More recent purchase orders without receipts
            are ignored.    * Manually Calculating – Clear the Auto-Calculate box to manually enter a lead time value in
            days. If the Auto-Calculate box is cleared and no value is entered, then the default value from the Set Up
            Inventory Management page is used.

            assemblies requires 10.1 units of Component A. Since you can consume components only in whole numbers, you
            cannot consume 10.1 units. Therefore, you need to round up to the next highest whole number in base units.Check
