  Definition of elements in a GitHub form.
  
  According to GitHub's
  [syntax for GitHub's form schema](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-githubs-form-schema),
  which is shared between issue forms and discussion category forms,
  each form must have a body, defined as an array of elements for requesting user input.
  Each form element itself is defined as a set of key-value pairs
  that determine the type of the element, its properties, and additional constraints.
