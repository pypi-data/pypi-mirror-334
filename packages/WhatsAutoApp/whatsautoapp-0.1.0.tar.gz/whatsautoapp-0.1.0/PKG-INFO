# **Bot Documentation**

It has two main components: the primary bot for managing messages and notifications, and a secondary bot for handling user notifications and registration.

# **Installation**

#### Configure your token: Place your token in the bot/token folder.

#### Usage

# **Primary Bot**

The primary bot handles the main operations and is controlled by the token placed in the specified folder.
Secondary Bot
The secondary bot sends notifications to users, such as alerts when a broadcast ends.
Utilities
The utils folder allows you to copy Excel files into it. By clicking the 'Start' button, the bot converts the data into a list, which can then be moved to the groups folder.
