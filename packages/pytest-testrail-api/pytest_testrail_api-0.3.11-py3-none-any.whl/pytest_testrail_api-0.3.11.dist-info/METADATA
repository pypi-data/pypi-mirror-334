# 3D4Medical Automated Tests

This is repository for 3D4Medical web sites, api and hybrid application automated tests.
It contains different folders for different kind of tests:

  * Web - web sites tests
  * Rest - api tests
  * App - hybrid application tests

# Features!

  - Running automated Rest tests
  - Running automated Web tests
  - Running automated tests for hybrid App
  - Allure Report generatin
  - Cucumber Report generation
  - Export test results in TestRail
  - TBD

You can also:

  - Export BDD test scenarios in TestRail

## Tech

Framework uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/contents.html) - test runner
* [pytest-bdd](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd) - for writing tests in BDD format
* [PyHamcrest](https://pypi.org/project/PyHamcrest/) - framework for writing matcher objects
* [selene](https://github.com/yashaka/selene#) - framework for testing Web applications
* [Appium-Python-Client](https://pypi.org/project/Appium-Python-Client/) - for using mobile testing framework [Appium](https://appium.io/)
* [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) - elegant and simple HTTP library for Python
* [allure-pytest-bdd](https://pypi.org/project/allure-pytest-bdd/) - framework for [Allure](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/) report generation
* [pytest-testrail-client](https://github.com/yeromina/pytest-testrail-client) - framework for [TestRail](https://3d4medical.testrail.net/) integration

## Installation

Each test framework has the requirements.txt file which contains all required packages for running the tests.
For installing the packages run the following command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For TestRail integration one more package is required. It can be installed like:
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/yeromina/pytest-testrail-client.git@master --upgrade
```
There is an issue with creating a saucelabs session with default urllib3. I forked it and increased the default retry count. To install it run:
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/yeromina/urllib3.git@1.26.x --upgrade
```

## Running tests
All frameworks use the 'pytest' as test runner.

For runnings all tests just run:
```sh
$ pytest
```
For running tests from specific package run:
```sh
$ pytest tests/package_name
```
For running tests from specific module run:
```sh
$ pytest module_name.py
```
More details about pytest on it's official [site](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/contents.html)
For writing tests in BDD format the [pytest-bdd](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd) is used
The command line that runs tests and generate all kind of reports looks like the following:
```sh
pytest --cucumberjson=report/cucumber-report.json --cucumberjson-expanded --alluredir=target/allure-results --clean-alluredir  -v --pytest-testrail-export-test-results --pytest-testrail-test-plan-id 193 --pytest-testrail-test-configuration-name Chrome
```

## Reporting
All frameworks can generate different kind of reports: **Allure Report**, **Cucumber Report** and export test results in **TestRail**

#### Allure
For generating allure report add the '--alluredir=target/allure-results --clean-alluredir' in the command line:
```sh
$ pytest --alluredir=target/allure-results --clean-alluredir
```
this will create the ***allure-results*** folder with results. After that you can generate report locally like 
```sh
$ allure serve
```
or use [Allure Jenkins Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/allure-jenkins-plugin/) for publishing report in Jenkins
#### Cucumber
For generating cucumber report add the '--cucumberjson=report/cucumber-report.json --cucumberjson-expanded' in the command line:
```sh
$ pytest --cucumberjson=report/cucumber-report.json --cucumberjson-expanded
```
this will create the ***cucumber-report.json***. After that you can publish it in Jenkins with [Cucumber Reports](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cucumber-reports/) plugin
#### TestRail
For exporting tests in TestRail run:
```sh
$ pytest -v --pytest-testrail-export-test-cases --pytest-testrail-feature-files-relative-path "features"
```

## TestRail Integration
TestRail configuration data can be provided in three different ways:

* **By using Environment Variables**:

Please set your credentials to system variables. Manual at the [Link](https://elsevier.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HM3D4MED/pages/119601273666444/How+to+set+up+credentials+for+TestRail)
```sh
TESTRAIL_URL=[URL of TestRail instance]
TESTRAIL_EMAIL= [email [of user to be used for communication]]
TESTRAIL_KEY=key [of user to be used for communication]
TESTRAIL_PROJECT_ID=[project id to which the data is sent]
JIRA_PROJECT_KEY=[Jira project key for integration with Jira]
```
* **By using command line arguments:**
```sh
--pytest-testrail-client True / False
--testrail-url [URL of TestRail instance]
--testrail-email [email [of user to be used for communication]]
--testrail-key key [of user to be used for communication]
--testrail-project-id [project id to which the data is sent]
--jira-project-key [Jira project key for integration with Jira]
```
* **By using ***pytest.ini*** file:**
```sh
[pytest-testrail-client]
pytest-testrail-client = True / False
testrail-url = [URL of TestRail instance]
testrail-email = [email [of user to be used for communication]]
testrail-key = key [of user to be used for communication]
testrail-project-id = [project id to which the data is sent]
jira-project-key = [Jira project key for integration with Jira]
```
For exporting **Test Cases** in TestRail use:
```sh
pytest -v --pytest-testrail-export-test-cases --pytest-testrail-feature-files-relative-path "features"
```
For exporting **Test Results** in TestRail use:
```sh
python -m pytest ./tests -v --pytest-testrail-export-test-results --pytest-testrail-test-plan-id [ID of Plan to be used] --pytest-testrail-test-configuration-name [str: Id of Test Configuration to be used]
```

## GIT Interaction
### Pre-commit
####We are using the pre-commit feature in our project. This app includes 2 automate formatters:
* Black
* iSort

**Installation:**
```sh
  brew install isort black pre-commit
  cd /path/to/project/
  pre-commit install
```
After that before every push PyCharm will be applying the pre-commit feature to the updated files.
