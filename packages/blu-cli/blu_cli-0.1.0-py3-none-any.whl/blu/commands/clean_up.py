    Features:
        - Identifies and fixes Python linting issues using `flake8` and `black`.
        - Automatically reformats code to adhere to PEP8 standards.
        - Prompts the user to manually clean up any unresolved issues.
        - Provides a summary of resolved and unresolved linting issues after the process.
        - Exits cleanly with an "all clean" message if no issues are found.

    \b
    Considerations:
        - Ensure `flake8` and `black` are installed in your environment.
        - Review unresolved issues carefully, as they may require manual intervention.
        - Use this command as part of your workflow to maintain consistent coding standards.
