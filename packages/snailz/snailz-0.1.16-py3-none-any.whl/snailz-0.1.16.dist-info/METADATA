# Snailz

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gvwilson/snailz/main/img/snail-logo.svg" alt="snail logo" width="200px">

These data generators model genomic analysis of snails in the Pacific Northwest
that are growing to unusual size as a result of exposure to pollution.

-   One or more *surveys* are conducted at one or more *sites*.
-   Each survey collects *genomes* and *sizes* of snails.
-   A *grid* at each site is marked out to show the presence or absence of pollution.
-   *Laboratory staff* perform *assays* of the snails' genetic material.
-   Each assay plate has a *design* showing the material applied and *readings* showing the measured response.
-   Plates may be *invalidated* after the fact if a staff member believes it is contaminated.

## Usage

1.  Create a fresh Python environment: `uv venv`
2.  Activate that environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3.  Build development version of package: `uv pip install -e .`
4.  View available commands: `snailz --help`
5.  Copy default parameter files: `snailz params --outdir ./params`
6.  See how to regenerate datasets: `python -c 'import snailz; help(snailz)'`

To regenerate all data using the default parameters provided, run:

```
snailz everything --paramsdir ./params --datadir ./data --verbose
```

## Database

The final database `data/lab.db` is structured as shown below.
Note that the data from the file `assays.json` is split between several tables.
Note also that the SQLite database file is *not* included in this repository
because its binary representation changes each time it is regenerated
(even though the values it contains stay the same).
The map of survey locations in `data/survey.png` is not included in the repository for the same reason,
but a duplicate is manually saved in `img/survey.png`.

it does *not* contain the SQLite database file `lab.db`;
run `snailz db` to regenerate it.

-   To simulate the messiness of real experimental data,
    the tidy assay plate files in `readings/*.csv` are copied to `mangled/*.csv`
    with random changes:
    -   Some files have a staff member's name added in the first row.
    -   Some have an extra header row containing the experiment date.
    -   Some have a footer with the staff member's ID.
    -   In some, the values are offset one column to the right.
