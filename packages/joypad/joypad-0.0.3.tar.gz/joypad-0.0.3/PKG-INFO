# Joypad

`joypad` is a lightweight Python library for detecting and interacting with standard two-stick game controllers (plus triggers, buttons, and more). It uses [Pyglet](https://github.com/pyglet/pyglet) under the hood to handle controller events asynchronously.

## Features

- **Simple Callbacks**: Define custom actions for button presses, trigger pulls, joystick movements, etc.  
- **Multi-Controller Support**: Detect and manage multiple connected controllers at once.  
- **Asynchronous Listening**: Controllers are polled in a separate thread, so your application stays responsive.  
- **Extendable**: Inherit from `BaseControllerCallbacks` to create rich, customized game inputs.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/) installed.
2. Install `joypad` (once it’s available on PyPI):
   ```bash
   pip install joypad
   ```
3. That’s it! You’re ready to start using `joypad`.

## Getting Started

Here’s a quick example showing how to set up custom callbacks and start listening to events:

```python
import time
from joypad import BaseControls, Manager

# 1. Define your custom callbacks by extending BaseControls
class Controls(BaseControls):
    def __init__(self, name=""):
        self.name = name

    def on_a_button_push(self):
        print(f'{self.name} Pressed A.')

    def on_left_stick_move(self, x, y):
        print(f'{self.name} Moved Left Stick:', x, y)

    def on_right_trigger_move(self, value):
        print(f'{self.name} Pulled Right Trigger to Level {value}')

# 2. Create a Controller Manager and start the event detection loop
manager = Manager()
manager.listen()  # starts background thread for event polling. 


# 3. Get connected controllers and register your custom callbacks
controllers = manager.controllers
print(f'Detected {len(controllers)} controller{"s" if len(controllers) != 1 else ""}.')
for idx, controller in enumerate(controllers, start=1):
    controller.nintendo_mode = True  # if you want the nintendo button layout.
    controller.register_callbacks(Controls(f'Player {idx}'))

# 4. Keep your main application running
while True:
    # manager.dispatch_events()  # if you don't have listen() running on another thread, otherwise not needed.
    time.sleep(1)
```

When you run this script, `joypad` will print out the button presses, stick movements, and trigger activity for each detected controller.

### Notes on Usage

- You only need to override the methods you care about. If you don’t define a callback, it will simply be ignored.  
- The ranges for stick movement (`x`, `y`) and trigger movement (`value`) may vary depending on the controller and OS drivers but typically are normalized between -1.0 to 1.0 for sticks and 0.0 to 1.0 for triggers.

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **No controllers detected**  
   - Make sure your controller is properly plugged in or paired (for wireless).  
   - Check if other applications can see it. If not, you may need to install drivers.

2. **Callback Methods Not Firing**  
   - Verify you’ve spelled and implemented the callback method correctly.  
   - Ensure you use `register_callbacks()` on the correct controller object, and that `controller_manager.listen()` has been called.

3. **Multiple Controllers**  
   - Each connected controller is managed separately. Call `controller.register_callbacks(...)` for each controller.
