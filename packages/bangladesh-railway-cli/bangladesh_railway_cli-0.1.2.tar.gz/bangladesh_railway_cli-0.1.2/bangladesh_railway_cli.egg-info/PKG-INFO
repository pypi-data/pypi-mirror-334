# Bangladesh Railway CLI

CLI for Bangladesh Railway's Ticketing System

## Motivation

* 🔥 [Bangladesh Railway E-ticketing Service](https://eticket.railway.gov.bd/) is maintained by ~Computer Network Systems Limited (CNS)~ Shohoz-Synesis-Vincen Joint Venture
* 🚀 The new service has some Laravel based APIs to query for trains and seats
* 👨‍💻 Users no longer need to be logged in to check seat availablity
* 😎 Why not build a Python client to do that?

> I developed a CLI for the old system built by CNS as well. [Browse here](https://github.com/mdminhazulhaque/bangladesh-railway-cli/tree/master-cns) for the old version.
