## Overview

`mcp-repl` is designed for efficient development, debugging, and testing of MCP servers. It provides an intuitive command-line interface that's simpler than using the Cloud Desktop app, allowing developers to quickly:

- Send queries to MCP servers
- View detailed tool execution
- Automatically save chat history
- Test multiple MCP services simultaneously

## Installation

Install via pip or uv:

```bash
uv add mcp-repl
```

## Usage

Start the REPL:

```bash
uv run mcp-repl --config path/to/config.json
