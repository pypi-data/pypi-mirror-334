# Dolphin

Dolphin is a multilingual, multitask ASR model jointly trained by DataoceanAI and Tsinghua University. It supports 40 Eastern languages and has been trained on a large-scale dataset of 210,000 hours, which includes both DataoceanAI's proprietary datasets and open-source datasets. The model can perform speech recognition and language identification.

## Approach

![Mulitask data format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataoceanAI/Dolphin/refs/heads/main/multitask-data-format.png)
Dolphin is built on Whisper and OWSM, using an attention-based encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder is Ebranchformer and the decoder is Transformer. Dolphin focuses on automatic speech recognition (ASR), its multitask data format is slightly different from Whisper's. Dolphin does not support Translation.
In additionï¼Œbase on the characteristics of the DataocanAI dataset, Dolphin introduces region-specific tokens for different languages, enabling support for dialects. 

## Setup
Dolphin depends on ffmpeg to convert audio to WAV. If your OS does not have ffmpeg, please install it first.

```shell
# Ubuntu or Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# MacOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Windows
choco install ffmpeg
```

You can install the latest version of Dolphin using the following command:
```shell
pip install -U dataoceanai-dolphin
```

Additionally, it can also be installed from source using the following command:
```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/SpeechOceanTech/Dolphin.git 
```

## Available model and languages

### Languages

Dolphin covers 40 [Eastern languages](./languages.md) and supports 22 Chinese dialects.

## Usage

### Command-line usage

```shell
dolphin audio.wav

# Download model and specify the model path
dolphin audio.wav --model small --model_dir /data/models/dolphin/

# Specify language and region
dolphin audio.wav --model small --model_dir /data/models/dolphin/ --lang_sym "<zh>" --region_sym "<CN>"

# padding speech to 30 seconds
dolphin audio.wav --model small --model_dir /data/models/dolphin/ --lang_sym "<zh>" --region_sym "<CN>" --paddig_speech true
```

#### Python usage

```python
import dolphin

waveform = dolphin.load_audio("audio.wav")
model = dolphin.load_model("small", "/data/models/dolphin", "cuda")
result = model(waveform)
print(result["text"])
```
