# DOCUMENTATION FOR VVLIB

> This lib is a collection of random, and mostly useless python fuctions, listed below

### goofitize()

> `goofitize(text: str)` is the perfect tool to mess with your text </br>
> - randomly makes letters uppercase or lowercase, turning "hello" to "HeLLo"

### vv_shuffle()

> `vv_shuffle(ts: list or str)` is (currently) a version of random.shuffle, being able to shuffle strings aswell

### vv_append()

> `vv_append(your_list: list, appendage)` is an upgraded version of `append()`, that appends `appendage` to `your_list`, but with a chance to append one of many ASCII faces instead.

### vv_banish()

> `vv_banish(offering: str)` is a handy tool for all your banishing needs. You just input a string of what you want to offer as `offering` parameter, and a handy turtle friend will draw up a pentagram for you to offer your offering for banishment

## Danger zone
### ragequit()

#### Enjoy, theres more to come, as the semester is long :)
