This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

### Additional Definitions ###

1. "Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
   other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

   provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on
   the Library.

3. A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
   Application with the Library.

4. The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
   Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source
   code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in
   isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Library.

5. The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means
   the object code and/or source code for the Application, including
   any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined
   Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of
   the Combined Work.
