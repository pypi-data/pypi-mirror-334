# mib-notebook

Mib is a literate programming tool to publish static html notebooks from python code.

Install it (`pip install` or `uv add`) as `mib-notebook`, import it as `mib`.

You put your code in a file like [docs/example.py](docs/example.py),
you run it like a normal python script (e.g. `uv run python example.py`)
and you get out [example.html](https://pietroppeter.github.io/mib/example.html).

It is [nimib.py] without [nim].

The goal is to experiment with a [nimib]-like python api.
