Mib is a literate programming tool to publish static notebooks from python code.

Install it (pip or uv) as `mib-notebook`, import it as `mib`.

See [example.py](example.py) and [example.html](example.html) for an example.

It is [nimib.py] without [nim]

The goal is to experiment of a nimib-like python api.
