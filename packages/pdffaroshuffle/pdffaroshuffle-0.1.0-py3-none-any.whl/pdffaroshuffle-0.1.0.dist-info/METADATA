# PDF Faro Shuffle

Have you ever scanned a long document printed in duplex mode, but your scanner doesn't support duplex scanning?

I had, several times, and I always ended up using `pdfseparate` and `pdfunite` in order to put all the pages
together and in order in the same PDF file.

After doing it a couple of times in the last month, I decided to write a Python tool that help me with this boring
task.
