# Scenario Instance Parser

25-2-26

Parses an initial instance population for a given scenario

The model execution engine uses this parser to get the initial instance data to populate a user model.

Using the Elevator Case Study as an example, we can create a text .sip file with a number of door, shaft, cabin, floor, etc. instances.

For each class, a number of instances are defined and for each instance a set of initial values is specified for each of the class's attributes.
