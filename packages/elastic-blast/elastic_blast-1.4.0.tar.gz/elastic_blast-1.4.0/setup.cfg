name = elastic_blast
description = ElasticBLAST runs BLAST searches faster by distributing its work to multiple cloud instances. This allows larger numbers of queries to be searched in less time compared to BLAST+ on a single host. Use of the cloud facilitates collaboration, sharing of results, datasets and pipelines on a common platform. The National Center for Biotechnology Information ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)), part of the National Library of Medicine at the NIH, developed and maintains ElasticBLAST.
