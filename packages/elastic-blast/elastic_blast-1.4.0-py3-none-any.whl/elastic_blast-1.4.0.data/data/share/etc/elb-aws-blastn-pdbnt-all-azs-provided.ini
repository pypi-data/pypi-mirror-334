# ElasticBLAST configuration file template to run blastn against nt
# with many subnets that correspond to various AZs
# NOTE: To make this work, the following code changes are currently needed:
# 1. Change SYSTEM_MEMORY_RESERVE to 0.5 in src/elb/constants.py
# 2. Change patnt size to 0.5 in src/elb/util.py
