# Pyxie

Create flexible websites with markdown content and FastHTML layouts - no design constraints.

## Overview

Pyxie is a Python package that combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of FastHTML to create modern, dynamic websites. Write your content in Markdown for maximum readability and maintainability, while leveraging component-based layouts for dynamic features. The result is content that's both beautiful to look at and semantically structured - making it ideal for both human readers and AI/LLM processing.
