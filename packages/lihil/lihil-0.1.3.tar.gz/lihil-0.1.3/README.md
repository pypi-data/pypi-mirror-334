# Lihil
**Lihil** &nbsp;*/ˈliːhaɪl/* — a **performant**, **productive**, and **professional** web framework with a vision:

> **Making Python the mainstream programming language for web development.**

GitHub Page: [lihil](https://github.com/raceychan/lihil)

---

Lihil is

- **Performant** lihil is unpythonically fast, 1-3x faster than other asgi frameworks in most benchmarks, event more with its own server. [mini benchmark](docs/simple_bench.md)

- **Productive** ergonomic API with strong typing support and built-in solutions for common problems — along with beloved features like openapi docs generation — empowers users to build their apps swiftly without sacrificing extensibility.

- **professional** Start small, move fast, achieve great, lihil follows industry standards (RFC9110, 9457, ...) and best practices (EDA, service choreography, etc) to deliver robust and scalable solutions.

## Features

- **Data validation** using `msgspec`, which is about 12x faster than pydantic v2 for valiation and 25x memory efficient than pydantic v2, see [benchmarks](https://jcristharif.com/msgspec/benchmarks.html)
- **Advanced dependency injection**, using `ididi` written in cython, inject params, resources, plugins, extremly powerful and fast.
- **OpenAPI docs** and json schema automatically generated with accurate type information, union type, json examples, problem detail(RFC-9457) and more.
- **Great Testability**, lihil is designed to be tested, however you want, web framework specifics objects such as `Response`, `content-type` is abstracted away(you can still use them) via `Marks`, you can test your endpoints like regular functions.
- **Strong support for AI featuers**, lihil takes AI as a main usecase, AI related features such as SSE, remote handler will be well supported, there will also be tutorials on how to develop your own AI agent/chatbot using lihil.

## Quick Start

### app.py

```python
from lihil import Lihil, Route, Stream, Text, HTTPException

lhl = Lihil()

# default to json serialization
@lhl.get
async def pingpong():
    return {"ping": "pong"}

# use type Annotation to instruct serialization and status 
@lhl.sub("/{king}").get
def kingkong(king: str) -> Resp[Text, 200]:
    return f"{king}, kong"
```

server-sent event with customized encoder

```python
llm = Route("llm/{model}")

@llm.get
async def stream(
    model: str = "gpt-4o", question: str, client: OpenAI
) -> Annotated[Stream[Event], CustomEncoder(event_encoder)]:
    return client.responses.create(
        model=model,
        input=question,
        stream=True,
)
```

### Serve

lihil is ASGI compatible, you can run it with an ASGI server, such as uvicorn

start a server, default to port 8000

```bash
uvicorn app:lhl
```

## Install

currently(v1.0.2), lihil requires python 3.12, but we will lower it to 3.9 or 3.10 in the next few patches.

### pip

```bash
pip install lihil
```

### uv

0. [uv install guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installation-methods)

1. init project with `project_name`

```bash
uv init project_name
```

2.install lihil

```bash
uv add lihil
```

## versioning

lihil follows semantic versioning, where a version in x.y.z format,

- x: major, breaking change
- y: minor, feature updates
- z: patch, bug fixes, typing updates

**v0.1.1** is the first working version of lihil

**v1.0.0** will be the first stable major version.

## Error Hanlding

- use `route.get(errors=VioletsAreBlue)` to declare a endpoint response

```python
class VioletsAreBlue(HTTPException[str]):
    "how about you?"
    __status__ = 418


@lhl.post(errors=VioletsAreBlue)
async def roses_are_red():
    raise VioletsAreBlue("I am a pythonista")
```

- use `lihil.problems.problem_solver` as decorator to register a error handler, error will be parsed as Problem Detail.

```python
from lihil.problems import problem_solver

# NOTE: you can use type union for exc, e.g. UserNotFound | status.NOT_FOUND
@problem_solver
def handle_404(req: Request, exc: Literal[404]):
    return Response("resource not found", status_code=404)
```

A solver that handles a specific exception type (e.g., `UserNotFound`) takes precedence over a solver that handles the status code (e.g., `404`).

### Exception-Problem mapping

lihil automatically generates a response and documentation based on your HTTPException,

- To alter the creation of the response, use `lihil.problems.problem_solver` to register your solver.
- To change the documentation, override `DetailBase.__json_example__` and `DetailBase.__problem_detail__`.
- To extend the error detail, provide typevar when inheriting `HTTPException[T]`.

Here is the generated doc for the endpoint `roses_are_red`

![roses_are_red](/docs/roses_are_red_link.png)

click url under `External documentation` tab

we will see the detailed problem page

![problem page](/docs/roses_are_red_problempage.png)

By default, every endpoint will have at least one response with code `422` for `InvalidRequestErrors`.

Here is one example response of `InvalidRequestErrors`.

```json
{
  "type_": "invalid-request-errors",
  "status": 422,
  "title": "Missing",
  "detail": [
    {
      "type": "MissingRequestParam",
      "location": "query",
      "param": "q",
      "message": "Param is Missing"
    },
    {
      "type": "MissingRequestParam",
      "location": "query",
      "param": "r",
      "message": "Param is Missing"
    }
  ],
  "instance": "/users"
}
```

### Type-Based Message System

Lihil has built-in support for both in-process message handling (Beta) and out-of-process message handling (implementing), it is recommended to use `EventBus` over `BackGroundTask` for event handling.

There are three primitives for event:

1. publish: asynchronous and blocking event handling that shares the same scoep with caller.
2. emit: non-blocking asynchrounous event hanlding, has its own scope.
3. sink: a thin wrapper around external dependency for data persistence, such as message queue or database.

```python
from lihil import Resp, Route, status
from lihil.plugins.bus import Event, EventBus
from lihil.plugins.testing import LocalClient


class TodoCreated(Event):
    name: str
    content: str


async def listen_create(created: TodoCreated):
    assert created.name
    assert created.content


async def listen_twice(created: TodoCreated):
    assert created.name
    assert created.content


bus_route = Route("/bus", listeners=[listen_create, listen_twice])


@bus_route.post
async def create_todo(name: str, content: str, bus: EventBus) -> Resp[None, status.OK]:
    await bus.publish(TodoCreated(name, content))
```

### Plugins

#### Initialization

- init at lifespan

```python
from lihil import Graph

async def lifespan(app: Lihil):
    async with YourPlugin() as up:
        app.graph.register_singleton(up)
        yield

lhl = LIhil(lifespan=lifespan)
```

use it anywhere with DI

- init at middleware

plugin can be initialized and injected into middleware,
middleware can be bind to differernt route, for example `Throttle`

```python
# pseudo code
class ThrottleMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, app: Ignore[ASGIApp], redis: Redis):
        self.app = app
        self.redis = redis

    async def __call__(self, app):
        await self.redis.run_throttle_script
        await self.app

lihil.add_middleware(lambda app: app.graph.resolve(ThrottleMiddleware))
```

- use it at your endpoints

```python
async def create_user(user_name: str, plugin: YourPlugin): ...
```

## Why not just FastAPI?

I have been using FastAPI since october 2020, and have built dozens of apps using it.
I am greatly satisfied with its API design and DI system, there a few architectual decisions I'd like to change and a few functionalities I'd like to have, specificially:

### DI (dependency injection)

NOTE: `Depends` refers to fastapi's di system

- Availability, `Depends` is simple and easy to use, but it is tightly coupled with routes and requests, which limits its usability, a DI system that can be used across different levels and components of my application is prefered to avoid creating duplicated resources.

- performance, `Depends` is resolved in a giant function which slows down dependency resolution as it does not optimize for different kind of dependency.

### Data validation

From my project experiences, using msgspec over pydantic for data deserialization and validation brought more than 10x performance boost.

`msgspec.Struct` is extremly performant, it is faster to create than a plain python class, and is often faster than a regular `dict` for non-trivial cases.

### Testing

I'd like to have a finer control of how my application works, take this endpoint as an example:

```python
@todo_route.post
asyc def create_todo(data: CreateTodo, repo: TodoRepo, bus: EventBus) -> Resp[Todo, status.Created]:
    todo =  Todo.from_data(CreateTodo)
    await repo.add(todo)
    awati bus.publish(TodoCreated.from_todo(todo))
    return todo
```

Starlette/FastAPI provies a `TestClient`(which lihil also supports), that goes through your whole app, but it takes quite a lot of efforts to mock everything.

You can test these with lihil

- the function `create_todo`, which requires all menually inject all three params and return a `Todo`
- the endpoint `todo_route.post` which requires only `CreateTodo` without dependencies, returns a json serialized `Todo` in bytes.
- the route `todo_route` with middlewares
- the app with everything
