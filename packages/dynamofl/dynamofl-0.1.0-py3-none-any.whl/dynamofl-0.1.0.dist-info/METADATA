# DynamoFL Core Python Client

- This is a dynamofl package built by DynamoAI to be used with DynamoAI System
- It's a wrapper to interact with DynamoAI APIs. Example
  - Create a model/AI System, Dataset, Test
  - View Test Details
  - Generate Billing Reports

# Installation

```
$ pip install dynamofl
```

# Usage

```
from dynamofl import DynamoFL

api_key = os.environ["API_KEY"]
api_host = os.environ["API_HOST"]

dfl = DynamoFL(token=api_key, host=api_host)

```

# Version Compatability

- DynamoAI has its own releases, and the deployed system knows what release version it's at (applicable from 3.21.0)
  - So for systems older than 3.21.0, we don't do a compatibility check
- There are certain changes that are not backward compatible, hence the SDK might not be compatible with all the versions of the DynamoAI System
- The SDK is smart enough to validate at the time of initialization as to whether it's compatible with the DynamoAI system or not and accordingly raise an error if it's incompatible

## What SDK Version was this compatibility engine introduced in?

- `0.1.0`
- Since the version compatibility engine is introduced in this version, the previous versions won't raise any error even if incompatible so we'd recommend you to upgrade to atleast 0.1.0 version of the sdk

## What to do when the SDK is incompatible with the DynamoAI system being used with it?

We recommend using the compatible version of the sdk with the DynamoAI system you're running using the table below

## SDK Version Compatibility

As mentioned above, we didn't have a compatibility engine before so the versions before 0.1.0 won't throw an error at instantiation even if they're incompatible

| SDK Version | Compatible DynamoAI System Version |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 0.1.0       | <= 3.21.X                          |
