Cafeto is a lightweight yet powerful framework, built on top of Starlette, specifically designed to simplify and accelerate the development of modern APIs. It provides an organized approach to API creation and integrates robust support for the three types of dependency injection: Singleton, Scoped, and Transient.

Additionally, Cafeto uses DTOs to manage, validate, and structure the data sent and received on the server. It also includes integration with OpenAPI and Swagger, facilitating API documentation and testing.

Although Cafeto is a robust tool, there are other options such as [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/), a lightweight and high-performance framework that serves as the foundation for other frameworks like FastAPI and Cafeto. There's also [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), known for its speed and automatic data validation; [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), ideal for large-scale applications with its "all-in-one" approach; and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/), a flexible microframework for simpler projects. Each tool has its strengths, but Cafeto stands out by combining efficiency, structure, and organization in a single package.
