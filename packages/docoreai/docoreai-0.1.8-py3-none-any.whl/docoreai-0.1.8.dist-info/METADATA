## 🔥 What is DoCoreAI?  
DoCoreAI is an AI **intelligence profiler that optimizes prompts dynamically** with intelligence parameters. Instead of relying on generic LLM prompts, DoCoreAI customizes intelligence properties (such as reasoning, creativity, and precision) to ensure AI agents generate responses that perfectly align with their roles.

In Simple words - DoCoreAI is an AI intelligence optimizer that dynamically enhances language model (LLM) responses by adjusting reasoning, creativity, precision, and temperature based on the user role. This eliminates manual prompt engineering and ensures context-aware, role-specific responses for customer support, data analysis, and creative writing.

Whether you're building an AI agent, chatbot, a virtual assistant, or a SaaS application, **DoCoreAI fine-tunes AI prompts in real time**, ensuring **clear, precise, and highly contextual responses**.  

---

## 🌍 Why DoCoreAI?  

### 🚨 **The Problem with Standard AI Models:**  
- **LLMs lack role-based intelligence** – A support bot should be empathetic, but a data bot needs precision.  
- **Trial-and-error tuning is inefficient** – Developers waste time manually adjusting temperature and prompts.  
- **Generic prompts yield unpredictable results** – No clear control over AI intelligence per task.  

### 🧩 **How DoCoreAI Solves This:**  
✅ **Intelligence Profiling:** Automatically adjusts reasoning, creativity, precision, and temperature for the Role.  
✅ **Context Awareness:** Adapts AI responses to the role (e.g., customer support, data analyst, programmer etc..).  
✅ **Token Efficiency:** Reduces API costs by optimizing responses.

### **Key Benefits**
- **🧠 Smarter AI** – Enhances reasoning, problem-solving, and adaptability.
- **⚡ Best Responses** – Intelligent prompts mean more accurate answers.
- **🔧 Full Control** – Developers can fine-tune intelligence parameters like depth, creativity, and accuracy.
- **🔌 Easy API Integration** – Works seamlessly with OpenAI, Cohere, Mistral, and other LLMs.
- **🛠️ Open-Source & Extensible** – Customize it for your specific use case.

## 💡 How Does It Work?  

DoCoreAI follows a structured process to enhance AI prompts:  

1️⃣ Identifies Role & Query Type → Understands task complexity.  
2️⃣ Maps Intelligence Parameters → Determines reasoning, creativity, precision, and temperature.  
3️⃣ Refines Prompt Dynamically → Adjusts LLM input for optimal response.  
4️⃣ Processes via LLM → Sends structured input to OpenAI, Groq, etc.  
5️⃣ Delivers Optimized Output → Returns a refined response.

#### 🔥 Before vs. After DoCoreAI  


|   Scenario          | ❌ Before DoCoreAI | ✅ After DoCoreAI |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Basic Query**     | `"Summarize this report."` | `"Summarize this report with high precision (0.9), low creativity (0.2), and deep reasoning (0.8)."` |
| **Customer Support AI** | Responds generically, lacking empathy and clarity | Adjusts tone to be more empathetic and clear |
| **Data Analysis AI** | Generic report with inconsistent accuracy | Ensures high precision and structured insights |
| **Creative Writing** | Flat, uninspired responses | Boosts creativity and storytelling adaptability |
| **Token Efficiency** | Wastes tokens with unnecessary verbosity | Optimizes response length, reducing costs |


---

### **🔗 Step-by-Step Workflow:**
1️⃣ **User Query →** A user submits a question/query to your application.  
2️⃣ **DoCoreAI Enhances Prompt →** The system analyzes the query or prompt and generates an optimized prompt with **dynamic intelligence parameters**. The required intelligence range  for each these parameters (like **Reasoning** - Determines logical depth, **Creativity** - Adjusts randomness , **Precision** - Controls specificity)  are inferred from the query automatically. 

3️⃣ **Send to LLM →** The refined prompt is sent to your preferred LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, etc.).  
4️⃣ **LLM Response →** The model returns a highly optimized answer.  
5️⃣ **Final Output →** Your application displays the AI’s enhanced response to the user.  

👉 **End Result?** More accurate, contextually rich, and intelligent AI responses that **feel human-like and insightful**.

## 🎯 Getting Started
### **📌 Installation**
You can install `docoreai` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/docoreai/) using pip:

```bash
pip install docoreai  
```
### How to set it up  

After installing `docoreai`, create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:  

```ini
# .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"  
GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"  
MODEL_PROVIDER="openai"  # Choose 'openai' or 'groq'  
MODEL_NAME='gpt-3.5-turbo' # Choose model  gpt-3.5-turbo, gemma2-9b-it etc  
```
---
Create a file-name.py:
```bash
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

from docore_ai import intelligence_profiler 

def main():
    print(
        intelligence_profiler("What is one good way to start python coding for a experienced programmer","AI Developer",
                              os.getenv("MODEL_PROVIDER"),
                              os.getenv("MODEL_NAME")))

....
```
Run file-name.py in terminal:
```bash
>> python file-name.py
```
The intelligence_profiler function returns a response:
```bash
{'response':

## Recommended LLMs for Intelligence Optimization
DoCoreAI is designed to refine and optimize user prompts by dynamically adjusting intelligence parameters such as reasoning, creativity, and precision. To achieve the best results, we recommend using ChatGPT (GPT-4-turbo) for this task.
While DoCoreAI is compatible with other LLMs (e.g., LLaMA 3, Claude etc), results may vary depending on the model’s capabilities. Developers are encouraged to experiment and contribute insights on different LLM integrations.

## 📌 Technical Note: Token Usage & API Efficiency
- Our Testing & Research shows that token usage is reduced by 15-30% when compared to normal prompts, leading to:
    Lower API Costs – Reduced token consumption means lower expenses when using OpenAI or Groq models.

**Proposed Enhancement: Vector Database Integration**  
We are currently exploring the integration of a vector database to store intelligence profiles for past queries. This will probably enable faster retrieval of optimized parameters for similar prompts, further reducing token usage and improving response efficiency. Stay tuned!

**Future Support for Fine-Tuned Models:**  
We recognize the growing demand for fine-tuned open-source models tailored for specific applications. In future updates, we aim to explore Integration with fine-tuned LLaMA/Custom GPT models, Support for locally deployed models (via Ollama, vLLM, etc.) & Customization of intelligence parameters based on domain-specific data.

Our vision is to make DoCoreAI adaptable to both proprietary and open-source AI models, ensuring flexibility for all developers. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
