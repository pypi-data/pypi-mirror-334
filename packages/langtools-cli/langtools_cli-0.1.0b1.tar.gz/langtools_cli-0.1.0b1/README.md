# LangTools CLI

LangTools supports CLI to help submit jobs to Ray or other hosting platforms (To be supported).

## Installation

**Note:** This tool can only be used in **Linux** or **WSL** environments.

You have two options to install LangTools:

### Option 1: Use the Installation Script

We provide a script to install LangTools and its prerequisites in one command. Run the following command in your terminal, go to langtools\packages\cli:

```bash
bash install_langtools.sh
```
After running the script, activate conda venv:
```
conda activate langtools-venv
```

### Option 2: Follow the Steps Manually

1. Install Python version 3.8 to 3.11: These versions are required because Ray 2.10.0, a dependency of LangTools, supports only these Python versions. You can use Conda to create a Python environment if you do not want to change your local Python version.

2. Install .NET runtime: The .NET runtime is required for the `keyring` package, which is used for secure storage and retrieval of credentials.
   ```bash
   wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/22.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
   sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
   rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y aspnetcore-runtime-9.0
   ```

3. Install `keyring` and `artifacts-keyring`: These Python packages are used for secure storage and retrieval of credentials, as well as for accessing private package feeds.
   ```bash
   pip install keyring artifacts-keyring
   ```

4. Install xdg utilities: These utilities are required for handling desktop integration tasks, such as opening URLs or files in the default application.
   ```bash
   sudo apt install xdg-utils
   ```

5. Install wslu (https://wslutiliti.es/wslu/install.html): This package provides a set of utilities to enhance the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) experience, enabling better integration between Windows and Linux environments.
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wslutilities/wslu
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install wslu
   ```

6. Install LangTools_CLI:
   ```bash
   pip install langtools_cli --extra-index-url=https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/msasg/WebXT/_packaging/Repo/pypi/simple/
   ```

## Usage

LangTools provides two main commands:

### 1. PackAndUpload

This command packages a Python file and uploads it to a specified feed.

```bash
langtools PackAndUpload -file <file_path> -version <package_version> -feed <feed_url>
```

- `-file`: The Python file to package.
- `-version`: The version of the package.
- `-feed`: The feed URL to upload the package to.

### 2. Deploy

This command deploys a Python file to a Ray cluster.

```bash
langtools deploy -f <file_path> -c <ray_cluster_url> [-r <requirements_path>] [--feed <feed_url>] [--num-cpus <number_of_cpus>] [-t <type>] [-h <host_target>]
```

- `-f, --file`: The Python file to deploy. This should be the entry point file of your tool.
- `-c, --cluster`: The URL of the Ray cluster where the job will be deployed.
- `-r, --requirements`: (Optional) Path to a `requirements.txt` file for additional dependencies.
- `--feed`: (Optional) Feed URL for additional dependencies. If not provided, a default feed URL will be used.
- `--num-cpus`: (Optional) Number of CPUs to allocate for the entrypoint. Defaults to 1.
- `-t, --type`: (Optional) Type of application to deploy. Defaults to `job`. Currently, only `job` type is supported.
- `--target-host`: (Optional) Target platform for deployment. Defaults to `ray`. Currently, only the `ray` platform is supported.

## Example

```bash
langtools PackAndUpload -file example.py -version 1.0.0 -feed https://example-feed-url.com
langtools Submit -file example.py -cluster http://example-ray-cluster.com -requirements requirements.txt -feed https://example-feed-url.com -num_cpus 4
```

## Authentication Notes

- The Ray worker in "default-prod" cluster is running with a PME managed identity:
  - `client_id`: `506ba7c7-124d-41cf-bb1f-829fa84990ad`
  - `object_id`: `c67f2f36-4de9-4f0b-997a-fa9cb9e8ddf4`
- The managed identity (MI) already has access to Papyrus.
- Use the AAD scope `api://56eb33f7-8aa4-47f6-b898-bd7ebb109bed/.default` for Papyrus authentication.

## Additional Notes

In your application, you can use different environment files to configure settings for local or Ray environments, such as `.local.env` and `.ray.env`. Similarly, you can use separate `requirements.txt` files for Ray, like `requirements_ray.txt`.
