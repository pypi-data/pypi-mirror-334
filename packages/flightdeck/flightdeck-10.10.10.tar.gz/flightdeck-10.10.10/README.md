# ✈ FlightDeck
Introduicing the all-in-one utility for your terminal, **FlightDeck**!
Designed for the folks who love doing everything from the terminal, from a guy who loves everything from the terminal

Also I know that my API Key for weather is public, but I don't really care since I have so many calls on the free tier- (5M since it gives a free trial right now)

> ### ⚠ Warning
> _For Windows users:_ Your antivirus may flag this app as a hazard due to the secure vault functionaility. However, your data cannot be modified remotely as this app will require no internet under then for weather. Please just ignore that warning. You will not loose any data from `flightdeck secure-vault` as long as you remember your password

## Download FlightDeck
FlightDeck can be downloaded using `pip` on all major OSes
```
pip install flightdeck

However, `nano` is recommended but not compulsary on macOS/Linux. Please make sure your version of Python also has `curses` installed.
