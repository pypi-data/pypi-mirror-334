# Tetris Gymnasium

![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Max-We/Tetris-Gymnasium/main/docs/_static/logo.png "Tetris Gymnasium")

Tetris Gymnasium is a state-of-the-art, modular Reinforcement Learning (RL) environment for Tetris, tightly integrated
with OpenAI's Gymnasium.

## Quick Start

Getting started with Tetris Gymnasium is straightforward. Here's an example to run an environment with random
actions:

```python
import cv2
import gymnasium as gym

from tetris_gymnasium.envs.tetris import Tetris

if __name__ == "__main__":
    env = gym.make("tetris_gymnasium/Tetris", render_mode="human")
    env.reset(seed=42)

    terminated = False
    while not terminated:
        env.render()
        action = env.action_space.sample()
        observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
        key = cv2.waitKey(100) # timeout to see the movement
    print("Game Over!")

```

For more examples, e.g. training a DQN agent, please refer to the [examples](examples) directory.

## Installation

Tetris Gymnasium can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install tetris-gymnasium
```

## Why Tetris Gymnasium?

While significant progress has been made in RL for many Atari games, Tetris remains a challenging problem for AI, similar
to games like Pitfall. Its combination of NP-hard complexity, stochastic elements, and the need for long-term planning
makes it a persistent open problem in RL research. Tetris's intuitive gameplay and relatively modest computational
requirements position it as a potentially useful environment for developing and evaluating RL approaches in a demanding
setting.

Tetris Gymnasium aims to provide researchers and developers with a tool to address this challenge:

1. **Modularity**: The environment's architecture allows for customization and extension, facilitating exploration of
   various RL techniques.
2. **Clarity**: Comprehensive documentation and a structured codebase are designed to enhance accessibility and support
   experimentation.
3. **Adjustability**: Configuration options enable researchers to focus on specific aspects of the Tetris challenge as
   needed.
4. **Up-to-date**: Built on the current Gymnasium framework, the environment is compatible with contemporary RL
   algorithms and tools.
5. **Feature-rich**: Includes game-specific features that are sometimes absent in other Tetris environments, aiming to
   provide a more comprehensive representation of the game's challenges.

These attributes make Tetris Gymnasium a potentially useful resource for both educational purposes and RL research. By
providing a standardized yet adaptable platform for approaching one of RL's ongoing challenges, Tetris Gymnasium may
contribute to further exploration and development in Tetris RL.

## Documentation

For detailed information on using and customizing Tetris Gymnasium, please refer to
our [full documentation](https://max-we.github.io/Tetris-Gymnasium/).

## JAX & functional environment

> This functionality is new and may be subject to change.

We recently added a JAX-based functional environment for Tetris Gymnasium. The functions for using the environment are
defined inside `tetris_fn`. We opted NOT to use a library like `gymnax` as these interfaces are still very volatile and
to allow for better flexibility. The functional environment is especially useful when performance is a concern, but does
not currently include all the features of the `gymnasium` environment.

## Background

Tetris Gymnasium addresses the limitations of existing Tetris environments by offering a modular, understandable, and
adjustable platform. Our paper, "Piece by Piece: Assembling a Modular Reinforcement Learning Environment for Tetris,"
provides an in-depth look at the motivations and design principles behind this project.

**Abstract:**

> The game of Tetris is an open challenge in machine learning and especially Reinforcement Learning (RL). Despite its
> popularity, contemporary environments for the game lack key qualities, such as a clear documentation, an up-to-date
> codebase or game related features. This work introduces Tetris Gymnasium, a modern RL environment built with
> Gymnasium,
> that aims to address these problems by being modular, understandable and adjustable. To evaluate Tetris Gymnasium on
> these qualities, a Deep Q Learning agent was trained and compared to a baseline environment, and it was found that it
> fulfills all requirements of a feature-complete RL environment while being adjustable to many different requirements.
> The source-code and documentation is available at on GitHub and can be used for free under the MIT license.
