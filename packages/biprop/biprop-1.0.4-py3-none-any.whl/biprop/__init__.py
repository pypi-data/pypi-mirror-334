Biprop - A Python Library for Biproportional Apportionment
==========================================================

Biprop is a python library that allows you to calculate seat distributions of
elections according to various apportionment methods. For further documentation
and examples, refer to the project's GitHub page
'https://github.com/herold-t/biprop'.

Example
-------
This is a basic example demonstrating how you can use this library to calculate
the biproportional apportionment of an election. We will use the same example
as the Wikipedia article
'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biproportional_apportionment#Specific_example'.
First we create an Election object that defines who got how many votes in the
election

    >>> import biprop as bp
    >>> parties = ['A', 'B', 'C']
    >>> regions = ['I', 'II', 'III']
    >>> votes   = [[123,  45, 815],
    ...            [912, 714, 414],
    ...            [312, 255, 215],]
    >>> e = bp.Election(votes, party_names=parties, region_names=regions)

Now that we have defined the election, we can use biproportional apportionment
to calculate the seat distribution. Since we perform the upper apportionment
according to the Sainte-LaguÃ« method, we need to set `party_seats` and
`region_seats` to `numpy.round`.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> seats = e.biproportional_apportionment(total_seats=20,
    ...                 party_seats=np.round, region_seats=np.round)
    Lower apportionment converged after 2 iterations.
    >>> seats
    array([[1, 0, 4],
           [4, 4, 3],
           [2, 1, 1]])
