# MonitorPeek

A sleek, lightweight application that creates a resizable, always-on-top window to display a live view of your secondary monitor. Perfect for keeping an eye on another screen while working.

## 💭 Developer's Note

Dear Users,

MonitorPeek was born from real-world challenges we face in multi-monitor setups. While seemingly simple, it solves several practical scenarios:

- When files or applications unexpectedly jump to a powered-off secondary display, eliminating the need to power on the monitor just to retrieve them
- For workstations where the secondary display faces another direction (like in customer service setups), allowing you to monitor it without physical repositioning
- In situations where screen duplication isn't ideal due to confidential information on your primary display
- When you need to quickly check your secondary display without the overhead of managing multiple physical screens

The goal was to create a lightweight, unobtrusive tool that makes multi-monitor management more efficient and practical. While it may seem niche, I believe it fills a specific gap in our daily workflow that existing solutions don't quite address.

I hope you find it as useful as I do.

Best regards,
John
