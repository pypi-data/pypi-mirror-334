ManiSkill is a powerful unified framework for robot simulation and training powered by [SAPIEN](https://sapien.ucsd.edu/), with a strong focus on manipulation skills. The entire tech stack is as open-source as possible and ManiSkill v3 is in beta release now. Among its features include:
- GPU parallelized visual data collection system. On the high end you can collect RGBD + Segmentation data at 30,000+ FPS with a 4090 GPU!
- GPU parallelized simulation, enabling high throughput state-based synthetic data collection in simulation
- GPU parallelized heteogeneous simuluation, where every parallel environment has a completely different scene/set of objects
- Example tasks cover a wide range of different robot embodiments (humanoids, mobile manipulators, single-arm robots) as well as a wide range of different tasks (table-top, drawing/cleaning, dextrous manipulation)
- Flexible and simple task building API that abstracts away much of the complex GPU memory management code via an object oriented design
- Real2sim environments for scalably evaluating real-world policies 60-100x faster via GPU simulation.
