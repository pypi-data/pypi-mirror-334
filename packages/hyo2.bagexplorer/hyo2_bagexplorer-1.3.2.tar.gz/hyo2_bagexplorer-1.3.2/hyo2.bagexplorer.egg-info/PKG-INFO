General info
------------

HydrOffice is a research development environment for ocean mapping. It provides a collection of hydro-packages, each of them dealing with a specific issue of the field.
The main goal is to speed up both algorithms testing and research-2-operation.

BAG Explorer is a light application, based on `HDF Compass <http://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf-compass>`_ and the `HydrOffice BAG package <https://github.com/hydroffice/hyo2_bag>`_, to explore BAG data files.

   |info| **IMPORTANT NOTE**

   BAG is a data format developed and maintained by the `Open Navigation Surface Working Group <http://www.opennavsurf.org/>`_.

   For the official BAG reference implementation, go to `https://github.com/OpenNavigationSurface/BAG <https://github.com/OpenNavigationSurface/BAG>`_

How to contribute
=================

Every open source project lives from the generous help by contributors that sacrifice their time and this is no different.

To make participation as pleasant as possible, this project adheres to the `Code of Conduct`_ by the Python Software Foundation.

Here are a few hints and rules to get you started:

- Add yourself to the AUTHORS.txt_ file in an alphabetical fashion. Every contribution is valuable and shall be credited.
- If your change is noteworthy, add an entry to the changelog_.
- No contribution is too small; please submit as many fixes for typos and grammar bloopers as you can!
- Don't *ever* break backward compatibility.
- *Always* add tests and docs for your code. This is a hard rule; patches with missing tests or documentation won't be merged.
  If a feature is not tested or documented, it does not exist.
- Obey `PEP 8`_ and `PEP 257`_.
- Write `good commit messages`_.
- Ideally, `collapse`_ your commits, i.e. make your pull requests just one commit.

.. note::
   If you have something great but aren't sure whether it adheres -- or even can adhere -- to the rules above: **please submit a pull request anyway**!
   In the best case, we can mold it into something, in the worst case the pull request gets politely closed.
   There's absolutely nothing to fear.

Thank you for considering to contribute! If you have any question or concerns, feel free to reach out to us.
