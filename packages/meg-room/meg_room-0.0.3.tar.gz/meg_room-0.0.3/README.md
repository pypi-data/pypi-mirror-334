# ⚡ Meg_room : a package to simplify MEG experimentation

**Meg_room** aims to enhance MEG data quality by assisting new experimenters, allowing them to benefit from the best practices established by more experienced researchers. It serves as the digital counterpart to the well-structured organization of an acquisition platform.

**Meg_room** is designed to connect the different systems in an experiment room. The user has easy access to hardware configurations, as well as a suite of tests and features to assist with experimentation.

For a quick introduction example : `examples/megroom_intro.ipynb`.
Make sure to configure correctly the path of the the room config file and the user config file.

# 🚀 **Features**  

The four main features of **Meg_room** are presented here.  

- ✅ **Automated Hardware Configuration Loading**  
  - **Simplification** Eliminates hardcoding of hardware parameters such as parallel port addresses.  
  - **Standardization** Provides all necessary drivers in a single package.  

- 🔧 **Experiment Configuration Sanity Checks**
