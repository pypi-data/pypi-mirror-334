# Cursor rules for creating a PyPi Python package

# 1. Ensure your package has a unique name that is not already taken on PyPi.
# 2. Create a setup.py file with the necessary metadata and configuration for your package.
# 3. Include a README.md file to provide a description of your package.
# 4. Add a LICENSE file to specify the licensing terms for your package.
# 5. Ensure your package has an __init__.py file to make it a proper Python package.
# 6. Write tests for your package and include them in a tests/ directory.
# 7. Use a version control system like Git to manage your package's source code.
# 8. Register an account on PyPi if you don't already have one.
# 9. Use tools like twine to upload your package to PyPi.
# 10. Follow best practices for Python packaging and distribution.

# Example setup.py content:
"""
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='your_package_name',
    version='0.1.0',
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        # List your package dependencies here
    ],
    author='Your Name',
    author_email='your.email@example.com',
    description='A brief description of your package',
    long_description=open('README.md').read(),
    long_description_content_type='text/markdown',
    url='https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo',
    classifiers=[
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',
        'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',
        'Operating System :: OS Independent',
    ],
    python_requires='>=3.6',
)

# Example commands to upload your package to PyPi:
