### Tired of Trying Harder? Ask the Sensei.

Exploit Sensei is a LLM-powered exploitation recommendation CLI.
The sensei will show you the way to penetration testing. It is not an automation tool, but enhances your ability!

## Features

- Tells you how to hack anything.
- Reads your penetration testing memo and provides recommendation.
- Levarages OpenRouter's **free** models.

## Prerequisites

- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) API key (FREE)

## Installation

```sh
pipx install exploit-sensei
```

## Usage

### 1. Set the OpenRouter API Key

Login the OpenRouter and get the API key, and set it with the command below:

```sh
exploit-sensei set <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>
```

The API key will be stored under `~/.exploit-sensei/` directory.  
Don't worry, **it only uses free models, so there's no cost.**

### 2. Ask the Sensei

There are various ways to ask the sensei for advice.

- **Option 1. Ask with Your Memo**

  A most useful way is to have the sensei read your pentesting notes and give you advice. Assume that during a penetration test you document the process in `memo.txt`. So the command is as below:

  ```sh
  exploit-sensei ask -f memo.txt
  ```

  The format of the memo file is up to you, as the sensei leverages the power of LLM. The sensei reads it and tell you some advices for further exploitation.  
  
  Furthermore, by providing the text (the `-t` option), you can ask for more specific instructions:

  ```sh
  exploit-sensei ask -f memo.txt -t "I want to find admin password on the target website."
  ```

- **Option 2. Ask with Only Text**

  Of course, you can ask the sensei with text only.

  ```sh
  exploit-sensei ask -t "Provide 10 XSS payloads."
  ```

- **Option 3. Ask with Instructions**

  If you do not specify the `-f` or `-t` options, the sensei will ask you for basic information about the target system and then give you advice. This is recommended as a starting point for penetration testing.

  ```sh
  exploit-sensei ask
  ```

### 3. Specify Model

When asking the sensei with `exploit-sensei ask` command, you can choose specified model as below:

```sh
exploit-sensei ask --model "deepseek-r1-zero"
```

To see available models, run `exploit-sensei ask --help` command. 

## Notes

- OpenRouter has a limit of 200 requests per day for free models. See [the documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/faq#how-are-rate-limits-calculated).
