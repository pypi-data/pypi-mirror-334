# Introducing: UnifiedCatalogPy

An unofficial Python wrapper for Microsoft Purview Data Governance's Unified Catalog API. Not affiliated or officially supported by Microsoft. Built as a personal project by tediously observing the internet browser's XHR network traffic and reverse engineering the API - ‚òïÔ∏è [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/olafwrieden).

## Overview üî•

UnifiedCatalogPy simplifies the interaction with Microsoft Purview's Unified Catalog API. It provides a set of features that allow you to manage and interact with various data governance elements, including operations for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting business concepts.

**Interact with:**

- Governance Domains
- Glossary Terms
- Data Products
- Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)
- Critical Data Elements (CDEs)
- Custom Attributes (üöß coming soon)
- Requests (üöß coming soon)
- Health Management (üöß coming soon)
  - Health Controls
  - Health Actions
  - ~~Data Quality~~ (no API support yet!)

> [!WARNING]
> This library is currently in development and the features listed above are yet to be implemented. It is not affiliated with Microsoft.

## Quick Start üöÄ

### 1. Installation

Start by installing the library. You will also need to install the `azure-identity` library to authenticate with Microsoft Purview.

```bash
# Install the library
pip install unifiedcatalogpy azure-identity
```

### 2. Authentication

Microsoft Purview requires an authorized identity to perform tasks. You can choose between authenticating as a user (via [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli)) or using a Service Principal.

> [!NOTE]
> In most cases you should be using a Service Principal to query Microsoft Purview (RBAC permissions can be scoped independently of a user). Remember that ownership of an artifact defaults to its creator unless you specify a user/group at creation.

#### Using Azure CLI

If you are using the Azure CLI, be sure to log in using `az login` before running your Python notebook. Your credentials will be automatically picked up by the `DefaultAzureCredential` class. Your user must have the **Data Governance Administrator** role in Microsoft Purview to perform operations.

#### Using a Service Principal

1. Ô∏èNavigate to the Azure portal to [create a new Service Principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/tutorial-using-rest-apis) for your application and generate a client secret.
2. Copy the Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID, and Client Secret (value) into your Python environment variables.

   ```
   AZURE_CLIENT_ID=
   AZURE_TENANT_ID=
   AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=
   ```

3. Navigate to the _Properties_ tab of your Microsoft Purview Azure resource to locate your Purview account ID. It can be found in the _Atlas endpoint URL_.

   **Example:** `https://<your-purview-account-id>-api.purview-service.microsoft.com/catalog`

   Copy the `<your-purview-account-id>` - you will need it in a moment to create the client.

4. Navigate to the Microsoft Purview portal _> Settings > Solution Settings > Unified Catalog > Roles and Permissions > Data Governance Administrators_ and add the Service Principal as a **Data Governance Administrator**.

5. Your Service Principal is now authorized to interact with Microsoft Purview Data Governance Unified Catalog API. Let's test it out! üöÄ

### 3. Using the Client

In your Python notebook, you can use the library as follows:

```python
# Import the library
from unfiedcatalogpy.client import UnifiedCatalogClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create the Unified Catalog Client
client = UnifiedCatalogClient(
 account_id="<your-purview-account-id>",
 credential=credential
)

# Interact with the client
domains = client.get_governance_domains()
```

**üí° Good to know:** Detailed usage examples for supported functionality is provided in the documentation section below. _Let's automate!_

## Documentation üìñ

Here is what's possible with the `UnifiedCatalogPy` client.

> [!NOTE]
> This library is not locked to a specific version of the Microsoft Purview API as an official API for the Unified Catalog is not yet available. This means functionality may change unexpectedly. [See limitations](#limitations-)

## Limitations üöß

- This library is not affiliated with Microsoft.
- The library is not locked to a specific version of the Microsoft Purview API as an official Microsoft Purview Data Governance API for the Unified Catalog is not yet available. This means functionality may change unexpectedly. Do not rely on this library in production for this reason.
- The library is maintained on a best-effort basis. It is not a full-time project and PRs are welcome.
- Managing business concept policies and data quality is not yet supported.
- No automated tests are included, functionality has been manually tested on a best-effort basis. PRs are welcome to add tests.
- No typed return schema is provided as the API is not yet stable.
