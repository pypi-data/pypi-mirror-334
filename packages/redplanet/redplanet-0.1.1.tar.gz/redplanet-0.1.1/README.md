NOTE: I completely rewrote this project in 2024 September, erasing the entire git history and restarting from scratch. See an archive of the old repo here: https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/redplanet_archive-240910

# Get Started:

RedPlanet is an open-source Python library for working with various Mars geophysical datasets. We aim to streamline data analysis/visualization workflows for beginners and experts alike, so you spend less time hunting/wrangling data and more time doing cool science! :)

(TODO: add key features from docs page once that's finalized)

# SELF NOTE / TODO:

- Make a list of all modules/functions and "internal"/"public" annotation like the "Submodules" section on this package's doc website: https://mrjean1.github.io/PyGeodesy/
- consider cleaning up dependencies like axing scipy (nvm pyshtools needs it lols) & pandas (does anyone else need it? check!) since it's bloated!!! use `rclone ncdu .` to explore venv folder to see what's bloated, and use `uv tree` to see if it'd even help to remove the dep.
