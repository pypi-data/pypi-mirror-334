# tiny-pricing-utils Package

tiny_pricing_utils is a Python package for option pricing and financial modeling. It includes implementations of the Black-Scholes and Heston models, Monte Carlo simulations, and characteristic functions for Fourier-based pricing.

Working examples can be found at: https://github.com/MichaelCarloH/Option-Pricing/tree/main/Option%20pricing

Key Features: 
- Black-Scholes Model: European option pricing.
- Heston Model: Class-based implementation with FFT pricing methods.
- Monte Carlo Simulations: Simulates stock price paths under different models.
- Characteristic Functions: Fourier-based characteristic functions for pricing using BS and Heston.
- Stock paths generation with Geometric Brownian Motion, Euler and Milstein Monetcarlo methods


## Features
- Utility functions for pricing options
- Helper functions for computing characteristic function
- Easy-to-use and modular
