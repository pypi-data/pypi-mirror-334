    """
    Computes the characteristic function of the log-stock price under the Black-Scholes model.

    Parameters:
        u (complex or float): Fourier transform variable
        S0 (float): Initial stock price
        r (float): Risk-free rate
        q (float): Dividend yield
        sigma (float): Volatility
        T (float): Time to maturity

def cf_Heston(u, S0, r, q, V0, kappa, eta, theta, rho, T):
    """
    Computes the characteristic function of the log-stock price under the Heston model.
    
    The Heston model allows for stochastic volatility, where volatility follows a mean-reverting process.

    Parameters:
        u (complex or float): Fourier transform variable. This is the variable for which the characteristic function is computed.
        S0 (float): Initial stock price at time t = 0.
        r (float): Risk-free rate. This is the rate of return on a risk-free asset.
        q (float): Dividend yield. This is the annual dividend yield of the stock.
        V0 (float): Initial variance. This is the starting value for the volatility.
        kappa (float): Rate of mean reversion. This is the speed at which volatility reverts to its long-term mean (eta).
        eta (float): Long-term mean of volatility. This is the value to which volatility reverts over time.
        theta (float): Volatility of volatility. This determines how much volatility fluctuates over time.
        rho (float): Correlation between the stock price and its volatility. A value between -1 and 1.
        T (float): Time to maturity. This is the time in years until the option expires.

    Returns:
        complex: Characteristic function value at u. This value is used in the Fourier inversion to price the option.
