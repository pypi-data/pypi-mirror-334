# MLDockKit
This is a simple platform for computing Lipinsky's Rule of five using the rdkit package, predicting pIC50 of canonical SMILES that are potential targets against Oestrogen receptor alpha protein as ant-prostate cancer agaents using a preformatted RandomForest model, and docking of the canonical SMILE with the Oestrogen receptor alpha protein using Audodock Vina package. 
### Purpose of the Package
The purpose of the package is to provide a unified platform for computing prostate cancer drug likeness indicess and performing docking on the same compounds. 
### Features
Important chemoinformatics features of Oestrogen receptor alpha antagonists such as:
    - Lipinsky descriptors
    - Prediction of pIC50
    - Docking and visiualization 
### Getting Started
The package is found on pypi hence can be installed with pip
#### Pre-requisites
Installation of Vina requires [boost](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_83_0/tools/build/doc/html/index.html#bbv2.installation) and [swig](https://www.swig.org/)  
Importantly: Install pymol as the first package in the new environment, this is due to environmental package conflict.
#### Installation
It is important to ensure that all the required dependencies are installed in your working environment. It would be much easier if you create a conda environment before installation of packages. The following packages are required, **pymol**, **rdkit**, **pandas**, **gemmi**, **padelpy**, **joblib**,**openbabel**, **Autodock Vina**, **java**, **scipy**, **MDAnalysis** and **scikit-learn**.
```bash
conda create -n MLDockKit
conda activate MLDockKit
```

Then, install pymol before installing other packages:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pymol-open-source vina mdanalysis 

conda install -c cyclus java-jre

pip install MLDockKit
```

MLDockKit requires the installation of [Meeko](https://github.com/forlilab/Meeko) for ligand preparation. Please note that the current release of Meeko is only compatible with Python 3.11 or lower. If you're using a Python version higher than 3.11, you must install the [development version from the source](https://meeko.readthedocs.io/en/release-doc/installation.html#from-source) for compatibility within the MLDockKit environment.

To install Meeko in the MLDockKit environment, follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/forlilab/Meeko.git
cd Meeko
git checkout develop
pip install .
```

### Run MLDockKit pipeline

```python
>>>from MLDockKit import MLDockKit

>>>MLDockKit(smiles,output_file,presentation,show_iAA,color,num_poses,exhaustiveness)
```

### Params:

```bash
1. smiles (str): SMILES string for ligand.
2. output_file (str): File path for saving output [default: "MLDockKit_results.txt"].
3. presentation (str): How to display the receptor [[e.g., 'surface', 'sticks', 'spheres', 'cartoon', etc.] default: 'cartoon')].
4. show_iAA (bool): Option to show interacting amino acid residues only (default: True).
5. color (str): Color for the receptor and interacting residues (default: 'green')
6. num_poses (int): Number of docking poses to generate (default: 10).
7. exhaustiveness (int): Controls search thoroughness (default: 10).
```

### Example running with default settings

```python
>>>from MLDockKit import MLDockKit

>>>MLDockKit(smiles="Oc1ccc2c(c1)S[C@H](c1ccco1)[C@H](c1ccc(OCCN3CCCCC3)cc1)O2")
```

### Output
The pipeline's output is an MLDockKit_output.txt file which contains **Lipinsky descriptos**, **predicted pIC50 value** and the **docking score**. Docking image is rentered in pymol for further analysis by the user. Also, the ligand's and protein's **.sfd** and **.pdpqt** files are rentered in the user's working directory.
