=================
UVICORN Deamonite
=================

Allows you to start/stop/restart ASGI/WSGI servers as daemons without needing
to know any commandline arguments or using screen. Add the following to your
flask/fastapi service. ::

  if __name__ == "__main__":
    UvicornDaemonite(
      name="my_app",
      description="Does do canonic pythionic things.",
      port="6969",
      log_level="info").start()

**name** has to be the same as the name of your main file. The rest should be
self explanatory.

After adding und making your my_app.py executable type: ::

  ./my_app.py

for more info about parameters.

Full FastAPI example
====================

The following code has to be in a file **main.py**, the Daemonite name has
to be **main** in this case.::

  #!/usr/bin/python
  from fastapi import FastAPI
  from uvicorn_daemonite import Daemonite

  app = FastAPI()

  @app.get("/")
  async def root():
      return {"message": "Hello World"}

  if __name__ == "__main__":
    Daemonite(
      name="main",
      description="Does do canonic pythionic things.",
      port="6969",
      log_level="info").start()

Future
======

I might add code so that info shows memory utilization.

Warning
=======

I know nothing about python, and I think its a pile of dung as a language. Has
some nice libraries though, so I have to make life bearable for myself. The
code in this lib might be very bad or unideomatic. Deal with it.
