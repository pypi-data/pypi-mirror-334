## AI

This tool was generated using AI, with the next prompt:

> create python tool to show slides in the terminal, (similar to "slides") but using Rich, Python library. the idea is take a Markdown File, find the key “---\”n and split the file in slides, use a beautiful color schema, and you can add at the bottom, the name of the users and the name of the slides (markdown name) and in the other side you can add the number of the slides such us (1/14 for example). allow run "bash" and "python" cells/Code Block, if you can write "r 1" run the cell 1. Also allow to copy the blocks and URL in the links using the command “c”, for example if in one slide you have 1 bash block and 2 links, you can run “c 3”, to copy the 2nd link or “r 2” to open the 1st link in the slide. For move between the slides, the user can user the arrow keys (next and previous), the enter key, or the space key (for next), up key (beginning), down key (last slide).
