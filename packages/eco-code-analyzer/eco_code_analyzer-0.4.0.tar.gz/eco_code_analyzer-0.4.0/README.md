### As a Library

```python
from eco_code_analyzer import analyze_code, get_eco_score, get_improvement_suggestions, estimate_energy_savings

code = """
def example_function():
    result = []
    for i in range(100):
        result.append(i * 2)
    return result
"""

# Analyze code with optional file path and configuration
analysis_result = analyze_code(code, file_path="example.py", config={
    "thresholds": {"category_score": 0.6}
})
eco_score = get_eco_score(analysis_result)
suggestions = get_improvement_suggestions(analysis_result)
energy_savings = estimate_energy_savings({'overall_score': eco_score})

print(f"Eco-Score: {eco_score}")
print("Improvement Suggestions:")
for suggestion in suggestions:
    print(f"- {suggestion['category']}: {suggestion['suggestion']}")
    print(f"  Impact: {suggestion['impact']}")
    print(f"  Example: {suggestion['example']}")
    print(f"  Environmental Impact: {suggestion['environmental_impact']}")

print("
Estimated Environmental Impact if Optimized:")
print(f"Potential Energy Savings: {energy_savings['energy_kwh_per_year']:.2f} kWh/year")
print(f"Potential CO2 Reduction: {energy_savings['co2_kg_per_year']:.2f} kg CO2/year")
print(f"Equivalent to planting: {energy_savings['trees_equivalent']:.2f} trees")
```

```bash
eco-code-analyzer path/to/your/project/directory -g -n 10 --visualize
```

Use a custom configuration:

```bash

## üåø **Environmental Impact and Tree Planting**

The Eco-Code Analyzer helps developers understand the environmental impact of their code by:

1. Estimating energy consumption and CO2 emissions for different code constructs
2. Providing an overall eco-score that reflects the code's environmental friendliness
3. Offering specific suggestions to improve code efficiency and reduce energy consumption
4. Calculating potential energy savings and CO2 reduction if the code is optimized
5. Tracking the project's eco-score over time to encourage continuous improvement
6. Estimating the equivalent number of trees that need to be planted to offset the code's environmental impact

By using the Eco-Code Analyzer, developers can:

- Reduce the energy consumption of their applications
- Lower the carbon footprint of their software
- Improve code performance and efficiency
- Raise awareness about the environmental impact of code
- Actively contribute to reforestation efforts based on their code's impact

The new tree planting feature allows users to take immediate action to offset their code's environmental impact. When using the `--contribute` flag, the tool will:

1. Calculate the number of trees equivalent to the potential CO2 reduction
2. Provide an estimated cost for planting these trees
3. Offer the user an option to contribute to a tree planting organization directly from the command line

Remember, every small optimization and contribution counts. By collectively improving our code's eco-friendliness and supporting reforestation efforts, we can make a significant impact on reducing the IT industry's carbon footprint and promoting a healthier planet.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration**

You can customize the behavior of the Eco-Code Analyzer by providing a JSON configuration file. This includes the ability to adjust weights for different aspects of the analysis and configure the coefficients used in the calculations.

Here's an example configuration file:

```json
{
  "weights": {
    "energy_efficiency": 0.25,
    "resource_usage": 0.25,
    "io_efficiency": 0.2,
    "algorithm_efficiency": 0.2,
    "custom_rules": 0.1
  },
  "thresholds": {
    "eco_score": 0.7,
    "category_score": 0.6
  },
  "custom_rules": [
    {
      "name": "check_api_call_efficiency",
      "weight": 0.05
    }
  ],
  "coefficients": {
    "energy_consumption_per_cpu_cycle": 1.2e-9,
    "co2_emissions_per_kwh": 0.5,
    "base_energy_consumption_per_year": 100,
    "base_co2_emissions_per_year": 50,
    "trees_equivalent_factor": 2
  }
}
```

In this configuration:

- `weights`: Adjust the importance of different categories in the overall eco-score:
  - `energy_efficiency`: Efficiency of code execution and CPU usage
  - `resource_usage`: Memory and resource management
  - `io_efficiency`: File, network, and database operations
  - `algorithm_efficiency`: Time and space complexity of algorithms
  - `custom_rules`: User-defined rules for specific needs
- `thresholds`: Set the levels at which warnings or suggestions are triggered.
- `custom_rules`: Add your own rules or adjust the weight of existing ones.
- `coefficients`: Configure the key assumptions used in environmental impact calculations:
  - `energy_consumption_per_cpu_cycle`: Energy consumed per CPU cycle (in joules)
  - `co2_emissions_per_kwh`: CO2 emitted per kWh of energy (varies by region)
  - `base_energy_consumption_per_year`: Assumed baseline energy consumption for a typical project (in kWh)
  - `base_co2_emissions_per_year`: Assumed baseline CO2 emissions for a typical project (in kg)
  - `trees_equivalent_factor`: Factor used to convert CO2 reduction to equivalent number of trees planted

By adjusting these coefficients, you can tailor the analysis to better match your specific environment or to reflect more recent data on energy consumption and emissions.
