# Sample Document

This is a sample document for the {{ project_name }} RAG application.

## What is RAG?

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances large language models by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge sources before generating responses.

## How does it work?

1. Documents are loaded and split into chunks
2. Chunks are embedded and stored in a vector database ({{ vector_db }})
3. When a query is received, the most relevant chunks are retrieved
4. The LLM generates a response based on the retrieved context and the query

## Benefits

- Reduces hallucinations
- Provides up-to-date information
- Allows the model to access domain-specific knowledge
- Improves transparency and traceability
