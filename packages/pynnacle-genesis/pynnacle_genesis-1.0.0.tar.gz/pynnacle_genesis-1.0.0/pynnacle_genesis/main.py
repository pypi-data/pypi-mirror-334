    The pynnacle-genesis module was initially crafted for the readers of Python Odyssey: Into the World of Robotics by Team Pinnacle, 
    complementing the Pinnacle Genesis board featured in the book. Built on the robust foundation of Pymata4 by Alan Yorinks, it provides
    novice enthusiasts with a hands-on coding experience in Python that mirrors the structure and functionality of popular development 
    board environments. The primary motivation behind its creation is to facilitate a smoother transition for learners as they delve into
    the complexities of robotics programming, bridging the gap between beginner-friendly Python and the more intricate structures found in
    languages for widely-used development boards.

    DISCLAIMER:
        Some functions within this module have been adjusted to produce specific outcomes that align with the book's content and 
        teaching objectives. Additionally, certain functions in this module may not be available in other development board environments.
        These adaptations were implemented to harmonize with the book's mission: to introduce robotics to absolute beginners in a simplified
        and intuitive way.
