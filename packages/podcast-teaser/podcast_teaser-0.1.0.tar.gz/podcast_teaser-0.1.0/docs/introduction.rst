How It Works
-----------

1. **Audio Analysis**: The system analyzes your podcast using multiple audio features:
   
   - RMS energy (volume/excitement)
   - Spectral contrast (tonal variation)
   - Speech tempo and rhythm patterns
   - Silence detection for natural breaks

2. **Segment Selection**: The most interesting moments are identified and scored based on these features.

3. **Smart Extraction**: Segments are intelligently extracted with clean cut points at natural breaks in speech.

4. **Teaser Assembly**: Selected segments are combined with smooth crossfades to create a cohesive teaser.

5. **Output**: The final teaser is saved with optional visualization of the analysis process.
