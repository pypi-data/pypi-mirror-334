## Description

Otripy is a GUI application for trip planning, providing an intuitive user interface for organizing travel visits efficiently. Otripy allows to plan a trip by adding markers on a map (based on OpenStreetMap) associated with a note.

Otripy is developed and daily tested on Linux. It should work on any platform. It has already been tested on MacOS.

Otripy is already usable but would be better with a lot of other features. Some wanted features are listed [here](https://github.com/kleag/otripy/issues). Don't hesitate to create a new issue if you think at other features. And contribute them if you can!

### Current features:

* Display OpenStreetMap map
* Zoom and pan the map
* Adding location markers on the map
* List existing location on the left part of the GUI
* Associate a note to a location. The first line of the note is used as the title in the list
* Search location by name, and add a new marker when selecting an entry in the list
* Delete markers
* Open and save local files
* Open and save files on any Nextcloud server you have access to
* Note text formatting (heading, bold, â€¦)
* Image insertion (copy paste only currently)
* Change location markers icon and color

## Installation

### For users familiar with Python

Otripy is on PyPi. To install it, run:

```sh
pip install otripy
```

### For all others

If you are not used to installing Python packages, the simplest method is probably to use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Please [install it](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) first. Then, open a terminal and create an uv virtual environment and activate it:


```sh
uv venv otripy
source otripy/bin/activate
```

Then install Otripy and run it:

```sh
uv pip install otripy
otripy
```

When you want to restart Otripy later, open your terminal, and run:

```sh
source otripy/bin/activate
otripy
```

Finally, to upgrade Otripy, to a new version, run:

```sh
source otripy/bin/activate
uv pip install otripy --upgrade
```

## Usage

To launch the application:
```bash
otripy
```

## Building and publishing

Otripy uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), please [install it](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) if not already available.
