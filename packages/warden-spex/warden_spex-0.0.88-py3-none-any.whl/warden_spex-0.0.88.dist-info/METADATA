# Statistical Proof of Execution (SPEX)

This repository serves as entrypoint for documentation and implementation of the SPEX protocol.
SPEX is open source and brought to you by [Warden Protocol](https://wardenprotocol.org/).
We encourage developers to use and extend SPEX in their own initiatives.

## Motivations

As a developer, you want to protect your computational pipeline from manipulation.
SPEX offers third parties a **secure**, **fast** and **simple** interface for verifying computation
such as in data processing pipelines and ML/AI inference workloads.

## Installation

To install SPEX:

```
pip install warden_spex --upgrade
```

**Important**: SPEX is progressing rapidly and interfaces might change at any time.
Pin its exact version for your project, to make sure it all works.
Have tests for your project, and update it once you verify that things work correctly.

## Usage

The SPEX protocol is detailed in the white paper Statistical Proof of Execution (SPEX).

This repository offers a reference implementation of the algorithms introduced in the paper.

An implementation of the PrimeSum task, as described in the white paper, can be found in [test_spex.py](./tests/test_spex.py).

For questions or support, please open an issue in this repository.
