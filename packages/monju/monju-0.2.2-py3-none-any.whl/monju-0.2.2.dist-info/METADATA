# monju: Multi-AI Brainstorming Framework

Monju is a powerful multi-AI brainstorming framework designed to generate, organize, and evaluate ideas using various Large Language Models (LLMs).

The Japanese proverb “三人寄れば文殊の知恵” (San nin yoreba monju no chie) is often translated into English as “Two heads are better than one”. However, a more literal translation would be “When three people gather, they have the wisdom of Manjushri”.

## Features

- Generate ideas based on a given theme
- Organize ideas into mindmaps and affinity diagrams (class diagrams)
- Evaluate generated ideas
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Customizable parameters for idea generation

The project started as a web app [monju.ai](https://monju.ai), which was released in July 2024.

This library is the core of monju.ai that does not include frontend part.

For general information of monju.ai, see my article from Medium "[***monju.ai: a creativity enhancement tool that uses multiple generative AIs to generate ideas and organize mind maps***](https://medium.com/@daicom0204/monju-ai-a-creativity-enhancement-tool-that-uses-multiple-generative-ais-to-generate-ideas-and-f13112313084)".

## Brainstorming Process by monju

For the general approach to brainstorming, see [Brainstorming - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming).

The brainstorming process by monju consists of three main steps:

1. Generate ideas in list
2. Organize ideas in mindmap and class diagram in Mermaid
3. Evaluate ideas including overall, good points, and areas for improvement

Each step is implemented as a method in the `Monju` class.

Both mindmap and class diagram are described in Mermaid text format. Output can be drawn by any mermaid-compatible tools mainly in JavaScript, e.g. [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/).

## KJ method (Affinity Diagram)

In Japan, another popular ideation tool "KJ method" is often used as part of brainstorming. This method might be known as "affinity diagram" in English.

The KJ method is to categorize ideas into groups based on their similarity. Each idea is written on a single card, then categorized into groups with labels.

People in Japan hesitate open discussion. Writing in cards and categorizing them into groups might help open mind.

In monju, affinity diagram is generated as class diagram of Mermaid. This process is called "pseudo KJ method" in this library.

For details of KJ method, see [Affinity diagram - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_diagram).

## Installation

```bash
pip install monju
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later
- API keys for the LLM providers

This library uses `LLMMaster`, a unified interface to access major LLM providers. Set API keys following the instructions from [LLM Master](https://github.com/Habatakurikei/llmmaster), another repository by the same author.

## Usage

### Batch Execution

By just one call, all the steps of brainstorming can be done. Here is an typical example.

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

from monju import Monju

API_KEY = Path('your_api_keys.txt').read_text(encoding='utf-8')

# Use this function to arrange parameters in dictionary format.
def pack_parameters(**kwargs):
    return kwargs


# Initialize monju with your API keys and brainstorming parameters
params = pack_parameters(
    theme="How to survive in the era of emerging AI?",
    ideas=5,
    freedom=0.2,
    language="en"
)
bs = Monju(api_keys=API_KEY, verbose=True, **params)

# Start the brainstorming process
bs.brainstorm()

# Show the results
print(f'Result:\n{json.dumps(bs.record, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)}')
```

Information related to a session is stored in `bs.record` as `dict`. You can extract items you want separately, or print/save an entire record as JSON.

### Step-by-Step Execution

There is another way to use monju by calling each process step by step.

The following example works equivalently to the batch execution example above.

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

from monju import Monju

API_KEY = Path('your_api_keys.txt').read_text(encoding='utf-8')

# Use this function to arrange parameters in dictionary format.
def pack_parameters(**kwargs):
    return kwargs


# Initialize monju with your API keys and brainstorming parameters
params = pack_parameters(
    theme="How to survive in the era of emerging AI?",
    ideas=5,
    freedom=0.2,
    language="en"
)

bs = Monju(api_keys=API_KEY, verbose=True, **params)

# Start the brainstorming process
print(f"Status: {bs.status}")
bs.generate_ideas()
print(f"Status: {bs.status}")
bs.organize_ideas()
print(f"Status: {bs.status}")
bs.evaluate_ideas()
print(f"Status: {bs.status}")
bs.verify()
print(f"Status: {bs.status}")

# Show the results
print(f'Result:\n{json.dumps(bs.record, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)}')
```

Types of `bs.status` are explained in later section.

### Input Parameters

There are several parameters to set for `Monju` class:

- Constractor parameters:
  - `api_keys` (str): API keys for LLMs in `LLMMaster` manner
  - `verbose` (bool): print progress for debugging, default is `False`
- Brainstorming parameters `params` as `dict`:
  - `theme` (str) **required**: theme or topic of brainstorming, a.k.a. prompt
  - `ideas` (int): number of ideas to generate by each LLM
  - `freedom` (float): value of freedom-looking thinking for each LLM, a.k.a. temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher more free-thinking, lower more concervative.
  - `language` (str): language for output, default is `en` and must be followed by two-letter code defined in [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)


### Output Format

Results, `bs.record` in the examples, are given in `dict`. Here is an actual output.

The `record` object contains the following information:

- `input`:
  - `theme`: same as one in the input parameter.
  - `ideas`: same as one in the input parameter.
  - `freedom`: same as one in the input parameter.
  - `language`: same as one in the input parameter.
  - `idea_generation`: LLM information used for idea generation.
  - `mindmap`: LLM information used for mindmap generation.
  - `class_diagram`: LLM information used for class diagram generation.
  - `idea_evaluation`: LLM information used for idea evaluation.
- `output`:
  - `elapsed_time`: Elapsed time in seconds as `list`: (1) idea generation, (2) mindmap and class diagram generation, (3) idea evaluation in this order. Mindmaps and class diagrams are generated in a single process, running simultaniously.
  - `ideas`: Generated ideas in `dict`.
  - `mindmap`: Mindmap of the generated ideas in Mermaid format.
  - `class_diagram`: Class diagram of the generated ideas in mermaid format.
  - `evaluation`: Evaluation of the generated ideas in dictionary format if multiple LLMs are used.

### Status

On average, one brainstorming session takes about 60 seconds to complete by monju.

There are many calls of `print` in the step-by-step example. Each print shows a different status, which is useful to know progress.

Types of `bs.status` are as follows:

- `not_started`: The brainstorming process has not started. Most of cases, this status is shown when the instance of `Monju` is created.
- `idea_generation`: Generating ideas in progress or finished.
- `idea_organization`: Organizing ideas in mindmap and class diagram in progress or finished.
- `idea_evaluation`: Evaluating ideas in progress or finished.
- `verifying`: Verifying if all the outputs are generated in progress or finished.
- `done`: The brainstorming process is completed.
- `failed`: The brainstorming process is failed at some step.

## Supported LLM Providers

One of the most important features of `Monju` is to generate ideas from multiple LLMs.

`Monju` currently sets the following LLM providers as default of idea generation and evaluation:

- OpenAI: `gpt-4o-mini`
- Anthropic: `claude-3-haiku-20240307`
- Google: `gemini-1.5-flash`

And OpenAI `gpt-4o` is used for mindmap and class diagram generation.

Monju is capable of single or multiple LLMs for each step:

- Generate ideas (multiple/single LLM)
- Organize ideas in mindmap and class diagram (single LLM)
- Evaluate ideas (multiple/single LLM)

You can configure which providers and models to use for each step. Set arguments of LLM information in `params` dictionary by calling `generate_ideas(**params)`, `organize_ideas(**params)`, and `evaluate_ideas(**params)`.

This customization is not possible for the batch brainstorming.

Note that providers are not limited to those shown above. Also possible to user other providers like MistralAI, Groq, Perplexity and so on, as possible as they are defined in `LLMMaster` class.
