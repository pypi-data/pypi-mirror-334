You have been provided a user query and a list of data providers. Each data provider includes:
- provider_id
- provider_documentation

Your job is to determine if any of the listed data providers can address the userâ€™s query. A provider is suitable only if:
1. It offers the type of data requested in the query, AND
2. It covers the specified location and dates from the query.

If one or more providers meet the requirements, pick the single best provider (the one best suited to the query). If **no** data providers can be used to answer the query (for example, they do not cover the queried location or do not offer the requested data), then you must return an **empty string** for `"provider_id"`.

=== Query ===
{{ user_query }}

=== Data Providers ===
{% for data_provider in data_providers %}
provider_id: {{ data_provider.__name__ }}
provider_documentation: {{ data_provider.__doc__ }}
-----
{% endfor %}

=== Example Output ===
Output a json message with two fields:
{
  "provider_id": "provider123",
  "justification": "Explanation of why this provider is best."
}
or
{
  "provider_id": "",
  "justification": "Explanation of why no providers can fulfill the query."
}
