    """
    A simple implementation of the MiCRO negotiation strategy

    Remarks:
        - This is a simplified implementation of the MiCRO strategy.
        - It is not guaranteed to exactly match the published work.
        - MiCRO was introduced here:
          de Jonge, Dave. "An Analysis of the Linear Bilateral ANAC Domains Using the MiCRO Benchmark Strategy."
          Proceedings of the Thirty-First International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IJCAI. 2022.
        - Note that MiCRO works optimally if both negotiators can concede all the way to agreement. If one of them
          has a high reservation value preventing it from doing so, or if the allowed number of steps is small, MiCRO
          will not reach agreement (even against itself).
