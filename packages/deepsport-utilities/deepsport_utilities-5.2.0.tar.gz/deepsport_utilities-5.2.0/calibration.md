# Working with calibrated images captured by the Keemotion system.

The calibration data shared by Keemotion allows determining the relation between the imageâ€™s pixels (2D coordinates) and points in the real world (3D coordinates). You can read https://ispgroupucl.github.io/calib3d/calib3d/calib.html for more informations about how it works and how to use it.

For Keemotion produced images, the origin of the 3D world is, by a Keemotion convention, located on the furthest left corner of the basketball court relative to the main camera setup ; more precisely in the inner side of the court lines. The unit of length is the centimeter and axis orientation is illustrated here, with z pointing downward:
