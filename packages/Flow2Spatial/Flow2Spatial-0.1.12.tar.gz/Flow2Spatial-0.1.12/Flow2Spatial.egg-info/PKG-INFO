## Flow2Spatial reconstructs spatial proteomics through transfer learning 

Flow2Spatial is the computational part of PLATO (parallel flow projection and transfer learning across omics data). 

It aims to reconstruct spatial proteomics from the values of parallel-flow projections in PLATO. Leveraging transfer learning, Flow2Spatial can restore fine structure of protein spatial distribution in different tissue types.
