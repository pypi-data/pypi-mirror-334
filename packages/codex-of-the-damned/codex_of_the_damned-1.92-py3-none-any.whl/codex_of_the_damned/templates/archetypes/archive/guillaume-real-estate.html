<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>powerbleed</em> deck centered around {{ guillaume_giovanni }} as a star,
    using his ability to get a very large hand and profit from the incredible versatilty it provides.
</p>
<p>
    The base idea is to always have acces to the right wake and bounce in hand, all the while building
    the axact required hand to get {{ dom }} bleeds through with the help of {{ nec }} modifiers.
</p>
<p>
    Ideally, {{ guillaume }} should be influenced first, then use {{ govern_the_unaligned }} at superior {{ DOM }}
    to help influence a couple of sidekicks to help. The deck delivers constant pressure on its prey, while providing
    very few opportunities to its predator: the size of the hand guarantees a fair availability in solutions.
</p>
<p>
    For combat management, the deck uses {{ nocturn }} to block potential rushers and combat ends
    with {{ spiritual_intervention }} just in case.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ deflection }} is the main defense against bleeds, and the hand size helps make sure there's always one or two
    available, with the matching wake.
</p>
<p>
    Guillaume's second ability, his stealth bonus for recruitments and employments, is not overlooked either:
    a good number of {{ nocturn }} are used as cannon fodder to defend against rushes or provide a few blocks.
</p>
<p>
    {{ sudario_refraction }}, although only present in limited copies, is a key card of the deck and often allows
    fetching the exact cards required for a lunge. A classical move is to use the second to fetch back the first one,
    this way ensuring the constant ability to fetch two cards (plus the other {{ sudario_refraction }}).
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    One of the big questions to answer when building this decks is whether or not to {{ storage_annex }}. Some find the
    card awesome, others are adamantly against it. Both seem to work though, as proven by this version (no annex) and,
    for example {{ marcins_deck }} in contrast. It's maybe a matter of playstyle and whether or not the additional
    pliability is worth it for you, at the expense of stacking more other permanent location effects.
</p>
<p>
    Some variants don't use {{ nocturn }} at all, relying instead on good old Giovanni {{ giovanni }} allies like
    {{ tye_cooper }}, {{ puppeteer }} and even the infamous {{ shambling_hordes }}. Check for example {{ pedros_deck }}
    from the 2015 Brazilian NC.
</p>
<p>
    A recent variation includes a heavier combat module, using {{ pot }} to devastating effects and providing more of a
    deterrent than the usually lighter defensive package. {{ immortal_grapple }} and {{ roundhouse }} can certainly
    make the opponents think twice before they block or act against the deck, and the large hand, again, makes the
    module
    that much more effective and available. This makes the deck more of a toolbox than a powerbleed build,
    but it can also work, as proven by {{ michals_win }} at the Czech NC in 2022.
</p>
<p>
    If the build interest you, you might want to also consult {{ gilles_article }} on Information Highway,
    which in-depth reflexions about the archetpye from an actual specificalist.
