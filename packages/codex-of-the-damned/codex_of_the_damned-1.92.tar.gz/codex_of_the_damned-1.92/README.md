## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Pull Requests will be merged if they respect the general style.
Issues will be dealt with as quickly as possible.

This site uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) and [Babel](http://babel.pocoo.org)
to generate pages dynamically and handle internationalisation.


## Installation

To install a working developpment version of the site, use `pip`:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Translating

Install a PO editor like [POEdit](https://poedit.net), call the following command
to generate the messages in the language you're interested in:

```bash
BABEL_LANG=es make po-update
```

Then open the generated catalog file,
`codex_of_the_damned/translations/es/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po`, in your PO editor.


While translating, beware to keep the `HTML` tags like `<p>`, `<em>` as they are,
and make sure you keep the exact same format parameters in the translated text.
They include anything dynamic, from disciplines like `%(cel)s` and clans like
`%(brujah)s`, to cards like `%(alastor)s` and external urls like `%(johns_deck)`.


Once you're done translating, generate the translation files with:

```bash
make po
```

To make a new language accessible in the website, you simply have to add the matching
line in the translation `nav` header of the global layout
`codex_of_the_damned/templates/layout.html`:

```html
<nav role="translation">
    {{ translation('en', "ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§") }}
    {{ translation('fr', "ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·") }}
</nav>
```

### Run a dev server

You can run the development version of the site using the `codex` entrypoint:

```bash
$ codex
 * Serving Flask app "codex_of_the_damned" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

You can set the `DEBUG` environment variable to activate the debug mode:

```bash
DEBUG=1 codex
```

### Production deployment

To run the production server, you'll need a web server like
[uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io):

```bash
uwsgi --module codex_of_the_damned:app
```

or [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org):

```bash
gunicorn codex_of_the_damned:app
```

## Useful tools

### Icons

Convert icons from raster to SVG using `imagemagick` and `potrace`,
depending on the icon, smoothing may be better or not:

```bash
convert -morphology Smooth Octagon:2 clan-ahrimanes.gif clan-ahrimanes.svg
```

### Google Translate

Use [POEdit](https://poedit.net) and [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com) to help with translations.

Run `make po` to build the translation files under `codex-of-the-damned/translations`,
edit them with [POEdit](https://poedit.net), then run `make po` when you're done to streamline them.
