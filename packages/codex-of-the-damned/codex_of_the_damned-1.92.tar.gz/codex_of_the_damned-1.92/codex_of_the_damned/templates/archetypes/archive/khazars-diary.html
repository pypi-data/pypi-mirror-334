<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is an <em>swarm</em> deck using multiple unique allies. The idea is to put
    {{ khazar_s_diary }} into play, breed a bit with {{ the_embrace }},
    defend by putting some allies into play and wait until {{ khazar_s_diary }} triggers.
    At this point, the dead allies come back into play as wraith to stealth & bleed the
    successive preys out of the game.
</p>
<p>
    The high recursion using {{ sudario_refraction }}
    is a strong point of the deck, allowing it to adapt its defence to the table context.
    It is very passive in the game beginning and uses
    {{ deflection }} and {{ delaying_tactics }} to defend a much as possible, while bloating with {{ liquidation }}.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is focused on bringing as many minions into play as possible, and relies a lot on the allies
    and their capacities. As such, it does have only limited combat, bleed or stealth modules.
    However, it hopes to quickly bring into play good rush or intercept allies like
    {{ carlton_van_wyk }}, {{ ossian }} and, specifically, {{ cry_wolf }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ cry_wolf }} fits this deck extraordinarily well: playing it requires to have some {{ anarch_convert }}
    to make the Giovanni {{ giovanni }} Anarch, but that is a small price to play, especially since it also gives
    them access to {{ piper }} to recruit their allies safely. {{ cry_wolf }} being unique and burning automatically,
    it will add a counter to the {{ khazar_s_diary }} systematically, while still providing a dreadful rush
    for a bit of table control.
</p>
<p>
    {{ the_unmasking }} and {{ fbi_special_affairs_division }} help
    making all these allies stronger defenders when they come into play.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ jake_washington }} is an excellent device in this deck
    as burning him in any way will add one counter on {{ khazar_s_diary }} easily.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    Minor variations exist, for example {{ inaki_puigdollers_s_deck }} from 2009 uses
    {{ change_of_target }} to help protect the minions — even the allies — from unforseen blocks.
    He also included some {{ tupdogs }} in the crypt:
    they can not undertake directed actions but they avoid repeating minions in the crypt,
    they can still block, recruit an ally like the {{ repo_man }},
    and provide one more minion to bring back as a wraith once {{ khazar_s_diary }} kicks in.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Faeries</strong> variant was played in {{ enrico_de_stefano_s_deck }} from 2018.
    It uses a dozen {{ draeven_softfoot }} and their burn option to quickly bring more allies into the ash heap,
    making it easier to get {{ shambling_hordes }} into play.
    It also uses more copies of {{ the_embrace }} and {{ khazar_s_diary }}
    as the idea is to trigger the Diary sooner, and bring all these
    {{ draeven_softfoot }} back as wraith with the new born vampires,
    for a faster, more aggressive version of the archetype.
