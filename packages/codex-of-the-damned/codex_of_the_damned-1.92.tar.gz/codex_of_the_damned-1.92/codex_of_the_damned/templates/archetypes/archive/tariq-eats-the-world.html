<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>wall & rush</em> deck starring {{ tariq_the_silent }}.
    His rush ability coupled with superior Auspex {{ AUS }} makes him a very efficient combat machine.
    On top of it, his protection against blood hunt let him play {{ amaranth }} without fear,
    so he can destroy vampires all around the table.
</p>
<p>
    Using {{ disguised_weapon }} to fetch an {{ ivory_bow }} or a {{ rowan_ring }} is usually
    how {{ tariq }} becomes so dreadful. Then his great didscipline help him fight and block with efficiency.
</p>
<p>
    {{ draught_of_the_soul }} make him even stronger as soon as he manages to dispatch a vampire or two.
</p>
<p>
    His sidekicks here field the same core disciplines he does, {{AUS}}{{cel}}{{obf}},
    to allow to build a very good wall indeed
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    Getting a {{ celerity }} on {{ tariq }} makes the combat module shine even more here,
    allowing for {{ psyche }} to be used to cancel combat ends, but it's not an absolute urgency.
</p>

<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are great variations in this deck, since the combat module's efficiency greatly depends on the {{ meta }}.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Anarch</strong> variant allows him to use both {{ diversion }} and {{ guardian_vigil }},
    two excellent cards, like in {{ lukasz_ho_thanh_s_deck }}.
</p>
<p>
    Dropping Celerity {{ cel }} altogether to rely instead on a bit of Fortitude {{ FOR }} is also possible,
    like in {{ erik_torstensson_s_deck }}.
</p>
<p>
    A <strong>Tegyrius</strong> variant is even more of a wall, using {{ tegyrius }} as a star
    and {{ fatima }} as another sidekick, with less {{ amaranth }} but more aggravated damage with
    {{ taste_of_death }}, as in {{ marcin_watras_s_deck }}.
