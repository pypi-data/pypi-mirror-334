<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a Salubri {{ salubri }} <em>powerbleed</em> deck using {{ feast_of_the_soul_s_secrets }}
    and {{ govern_the_unaligned }} to bleed, combined with a collection of block denial tools.
    First and foremost {{ seduction }} and {{ forced_confessional }}, but this is supported by additional Master cards:
    {{ anarch_troublemaker }}, {{ misdirection }}, and {{ pentex_subversion }}.
</p>
<p>
    Relying on the fact that Salubri {{ salubri }} have Fortitude {{ for }}, the deck uses a few {{ freak_drive }} to
    allow the vampires to use both {{ govern_the_unaligned }} or {{ scouting_mission }} at superior, then
    {{ feast_of_the_soul_s_secrets }} or another {{ dom }} bleed action. This helps bring vampires out pretty quickly.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is all about constructing the right lunge, and it's brutal. After a couple of "light" bleeds of 3
    with {{ feast_of_the_soul_s_secrets }}, and having brought at least 3 vampires out, it will seek to paralyze
    the prey with {{ anarch_troublemaker }}, {{ misdirection }} or {{ pentex_subversion }}, leaving only one or two
    potential blockers that can be denied with the modifiers, {{ seduction }} and {{ forced_confessional }}.
    {{ unleashing_the_bestial_soul }} can even be used to make a wake & bounce strategy fail short of blood.
</p>
<p>
    In the meantime, the deck just adds to the pressure with a lot of {{ dom }} and {{ AUS }} bounces.
    Against combat, {{ for }} prevention all over helps resist most opponents.
</p>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>
    The amount of combat defense required will completely depend on the expected {{ meta }}.
    Other than that, the block denial package is impressive, as it should if it aims to be able to pass
    a {{ gangrel_thing }}. It could also include {{ blind_spot }} or {{ daring_the_dawn }} maybe even a surprise
    {{ kiss_of_ra }} or the incidental {{ mind_rape }} to be able to make the most of opportune situations.
</p>
<p>
    It's nice to see the Salubri {{ salubri }} scoring a victory here, and it's an interesting feat
    in the highly competitive Finnish meta. Let's see if this can be refined to make it to the top tier.
