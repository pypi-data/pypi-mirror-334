<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a brutal <em>swarm rush</em> deck. Low-capacity vampire {{ bums_rush }} the opposition,
    using {{ saturday_night_special }} with {{ dragon_breath_rounds }} (hence the name, DBR),
    to remove everyone from the board.
</p>
<p>
    {{ concealed_weapon }} is used to fetch the gun directly in combat, and a good portion of the crypt has {{ dom }},
    so they can use {{ graverobbing }} to permanently remove the target from their opponent's board, and even rescue it
    afterwards if they have some blood left: after all, anyone can use a {{ saturday_night_special }}.
</p>
<p>
    Once the board is clear enough, just bleed for one to sweep the table.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    This is a rush deck, so a control deck. One can definitely let a couple of VPs slip to the opposition if it makes
    for a faster game.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The {{ saturday_night_special }} & {{ dragon_breath_rounds }} combination can be found in a variety of decks,
    although maybe not in such a monomaniac intensity as in this one.
</p>
<p>
    It can be run as a side threat alongside {{ flash_grenade }}, as in Brams infamous {{anu_deck}}.
</p>
<p>
    Or combined with {{ antonio_d_erlette }} and his {{ nephandus }} like in {{ mirko_anconitani_s_deck }}.
