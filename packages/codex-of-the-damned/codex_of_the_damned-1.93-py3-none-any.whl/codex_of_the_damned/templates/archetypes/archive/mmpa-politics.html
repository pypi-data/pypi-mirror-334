<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>vote & bleed</em> deck relying on
    <strong>M</strong>ulti <strong>M</strong>aster <strong>P</strong>hase <strong>A</strong>ctions (MMPA)
    for high bloat and recursion.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is to get Anson out first to allow for more master phase actions, then bring other big capacity vampires
    (Inner Circle vampires first) to bleed your prey until the oust. The few available votes can help with the oust,
    especially {{ banishment }} and {{ anarchist_uprising }}.
</p>
<p>
    The master module is, of course, key here. With more than half of the deck being Master cards, getting {{ anson }}
    and a {{ parthenon }} early is essential. The classic combination of {{ liquidation }} and {{ ashur_tablets }}
    ensure high recursion and a bit of bloat. If drawn, {{ information_highway }} provides a welcome acceleration
    for the crypt, but whether it hits the table or not, the high quantity of {{ villein }} is used to get 5 pool back
    for any vampire that gets influenced.
</p>
<p>
    The vampires votes should provide decent defense against political decks, and the {{ dom }} bounces {{ deflection }}
    and {{ redirection }} provide solid bleed defense. On the combat side, {{ pre }} is used for the usual {{ sce }}
    with {{ majesty }} and {{ staredown }}, but {{ obedience }} is also an option.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    The deck can struggle against swarms, hence the inclusion of {{ scourge_of_the_enochians }} and
    {{ anarchist_uprising }}. Moreover, the three copies of {{ entrancement }} that can be called back again and
    again with {{ ashur_tablets }}, make for a very strong module against allies swarms like {{ emerald_legion }}.
</p>
<p>
    What to bring back with the {{ ashur_tablets }} is the key decision that can make or break a game.
    High table awareness is required to adapt the deck proportions on stealth, bounces and combat ends to match the
    table and ensure optimal card flow in the second half of the game.
</p>
<p>
    {{ voter_captivation }} can, in the right context, resplenish one of the vampires after a {{ villein }} and, even,
    allow for a second one to be played for more bloat. Keeping a {{ perfect_paragon }} in hand to push the vote there
    can be worth it if its stealth is not needed.
</p>
<p>
    {{ spying_mission }} can be used to avoid damaging the grand-prey by accident if the prey bounces the bleed rather
    than trying to match the stealth.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There is no real variant for this deck but, of course, the deck itself is some kind of variant of the
    {{ girls_will_find_inner_circle }} but is also reminiscent of the old {{ council_of_doom }}.
</p>
<p>
    Surely, some adaptations can be done to adapt to the {{ meta }}. The inclusion of {{ parity_shift }} is
    questionable,
    since the deck has so many ways to recoup pool that it is tricky to find the window to play it. One would think
    {{ reins_of_power }} would be considered here, instead. Other strong Master cards are curiously absent, like
    {{ the_coven }} and {{ giants_blood }}.
</p>
<p>
    Corey himself let us a useful comment with the decklist:
</p>
<p>
    I made some adjustments for Origins that I probably shouldn't have, namely that I took out {{ archon_investigation
    }}
    in favor of a {{ not_to_be }}.
    I go back and forth on {{ voter_captivation }} at 1-2. {{ parity_shift }} may come out as I discard it most often,
    in favor of an {{ ancilla_empowerment }}.
    I'm not sold on {{ sarrasine }}/{{ kephamos }} other than it's nice to have other minions to bring up.
    Other than that the deck has proven to be pretty tight.
