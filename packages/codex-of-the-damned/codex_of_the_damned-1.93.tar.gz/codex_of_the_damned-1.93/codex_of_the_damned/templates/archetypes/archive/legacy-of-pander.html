<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is an infamous <em>swarm vote</em> deck featuring the Panders {{ pander }}.
    The idea is simple enough: get some cheap panders out on turn one, call some political actions
    to get them more votes immediately before there are any other titled vampires on the table,
    like a {{ crusade }} or, of course, {{ legacy_of_pander }}.
</p>
<p>
    Once the vote lock is set, it votes successive preys out of the game with damaging votes like
    {{ kine_resources_contested }}, while bloating consistently with {{ consanguineous_boon }}.
</p>
<p>
    Combat defense consists of just a few {{ dodge }} because there's no stable discipline the Panders {{ pander }}
    can rely on. This version also features {{ change_of_target }} to avoid combat in case of block, since it only
    has the natural +1 stealth provided by political actions.
</p>
<p>
    In case the vote lock gets broken at some point, {{ private_audience }} and {{ dia_de_los_muertos }} can be used
    to pass the necessary {{ crusade }} or {{ legacy_of_pander }} to regain it.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, the Master module provides a lot of help to influence more Panders {{ pander }} faster, with a lot of
    {{ information_highway }} and {{ dreams_of_the_sphinx }} on top of {{ effective_management }}, in order to be able
    to continue to influence one vampire per turn after the 4 initial ones are there.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ kindred_segregation }} is probably here for {{ meta }} reasons, as {{ emerald_legionnaire }} had not yet been
    nerfed and {{ emerald_legion }} was a widespread and dangerous archetype.
</p>
<p>
    {{ the_uncoiling }} is here to counter a possible {{ scourge_of_the_enochians }} that would just destroy the deck.
</p>
<p>
    {{ cryptic_rider }} has multiple angles: it can either be used to land a {{ crusade }} to regain the vote lock after
    passing a negotiated vote, but more interestingly it can be used for the lunge, to avoid a {{ poison_pill }} or
    {{ delaying_tactics }} on the last vote required to oust the prey.
</p>
<p>
    The speed and number of actions in a turn is what makes the deck so dreadful and efficient,
    so the few {{ fiendish_tongue }} are there to provide an additional problematic action for a {{ change_of_target }}:
    this way the blocked vampire does not just stand there, but adds one more action in the turn, making it harder for
    the prey to block everything.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There's a lot of interesting choices for the Master module. {{ fear_of_mekhet }} is a common inclusion against
    Inner Circle builds like {{ stanislava }} or {{ lutz_politics }}. {{ kaymakli_nightmares }} is also seen, just
    because its dramatic effect can just win the game outright if it's drawn in the 10 first cards. {{ joseph_pander }}
    is also a common inclusion against rushes. On the votes side, {{ disputed_territory }} and {{ rumors_of_gehenna }}
    can find a place, as well as {{ year_of_fortune }}. And infally, a couple of {{ embrace }} often find a slot too.
</p>
<p>
    One of the most egregious variant uses <strong>Gehenna</strong> events on top of it all, to cripple the other
    decks relying on Disciplines while staying unaffected. It usually goes for {{ the_slow_withering }},
    {{ veil_of_darkness }} and {{ the_rising }}, like in {{ dave_riordan_s_deck }}
    from the 2021 Online World Championship
</p>
<p>
    Another way to approach the stealth and vote lock issues is to include some higher capacity titled vampires,
    like <strong>Inner Circle</strong> with {{ OBF }}, so they can provide additional votes but also stealth,
    and even share a bit of it with {{ veil_the_legions }} or {{ cloak_the_gathering }}.
    A good example is {{ tomas_lopez_jimenez_deck }} from the 2020 Spain Grand Prix
