<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a classic Malkavian {{ malkavian }} <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck using {{ DOM }}{{ OBF }}
    to devastating effect.
</p>
<p>
    The base plan is the most straightforward there is: influence the highest capacity vampire first,
    use {{ govern_the_unaligned }} at superior Dominate {{ DOM }} a couple of times to influence some other vampires
    fast and cheap, then bleed hard with {{ govern_the_unaligned }} at inferior Dominate {{ dom }}, using {{ OBF }}
    for stealth, and additional {{ dom }} modifiers for even stronger bleeds.
</p>
<p>
    Dominate {{ dom }} is also useful for defense, since it provides {{ deflection }} to avoid the predator's bleeds
    and,
    while adding to the deck's bleed pressure at the same time.
</p>
<p>
    This deck also uses a {{ second_tradition_domain }} & {{ obedience }} defensive package, that is usually associated
    to the {{ lucian }} version of the deck, but can still definitely work if the {{ meta }} is low cap enough.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ spying_mission }} helps negate bleeds that get bounced by the prey, to avoid helping them.
</p>
<p>
    {{ madness_network }} is a nice addition, since it allows to either bleed during the prey's turn to avoid
    an {{ archon_investigation }} (since it's an out-of-turn Master it cannot be played duing one's own turn),
    or at the end of the predator's turn to get the edge and benefit from it immediately after.
</p>
<p>
    Master cancellation, with {{ wash }} and {{ sudden_reversal }}, is especially useful to counter Master bloating
    devices like {{ villein }}, but can also slow down some deck or avoid painful permanent intercept locations.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    Using higher capacity titled vampires, especially including {{ lucian }},
    can help make {{ obedience }} more relevant,
    and also allows for the inclusion of a few political actions, like in {{jose_luis_manuel_s_deck}}.
