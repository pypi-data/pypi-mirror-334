<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This an <em>allies swarm</em> deck. It uses {{ spell_of_life }} to put into play an army of big mummies,
    then proceeds to bleed its successive preys.
</p>
<p>
    Using {{ nakhthorheb }} for the job is a common choice, because he has a great ability.
    He can also get an {{ enkil_cog }}, multiplying his bleeding power in the late game
</p>
<p>
    The plan is pretty straightforward: put a {{ spell_of_life }} in play every turn until it triggers,
    while accumulating different big capacity vampires in the crypt in the meantime.
</p>
<p>
    Obfuscate {{ OBF }} is, of course, used for stealth, to make sure those {{ spell_of_life }} can hit the board
    unhindered.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    When {{ spell_of_life }} triggers, the mummies can act immediately, since they have not been recruited.
    This immediate shift in the deck's power can often be underestimate by the opponents, since the whole deck
    was pretty low-key in the few turns before that.
</p>
<p>
    A couple of {{ enticement }} can help damage the prey's pool.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    Since 2014, including a couple of {{ in_memory_of_the_two_lands }} is usual.
</p>
<p>
    Using another star, or no star at all, with more mummies allies like {{ nephren_ka }}
    or {{ tutu_the_doubly_evil_one }} is also possible, like in {{ elzo_benzaquen_s_deck }} from 2017.
