# Model Facts
Create a Model Facts label to improve the transparency of your model when communicating with end users. 
This label provides a framework to interrogate models for biases. 
It provides information required for comparability in a simple and flexible format.

## Framework
<img src="https://github.com/jhzsquared/model_facts/blob/main/model_facts.png" alt = "Model Facts" width = 200 />

## Installation
It can be installed from PyPI using: 

```pip install modelfacts```

Note: the template notebooks are only available in the source distribution.

You can also clone this repository and install required packages through:

```
git clone https://github.com/jhzsquared/model_facts.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Model Facts is designed to be flexible, whether you have pre-formatted data and results and just want to fill out a template, or want to generate your own statistics.

### Template
1. Download the `model_facts_template.ipynb` notebook.
1. Create a csv file with the test data, the aligned demographic variables, predictions, baseline, and truth values.
1. Run the first code cell
1. Fill out the form
1. Profit! :)

Note: the template currently only supports metrics from `scikit-learn.metrics`, binary classification, and regression models. For more complex modeling problems, please reference the other workflows.

### DIY
The `demo/model_facts_titanic.ipynb` notebook provides a simple example of how you can use Model Facts labels on your own dataset with more flexibility through the `modelfacts.ModelFacts` class.

### Extra DIY
Use the `modelfacts.ModelFactsLabel` class and pass in your own pre-calculated statistics.

```
model_facts_data = (admin_data, accuracy_data, demographic_data)
mf_label = mfw.ModelFactsLabel(model_facts_data)
table = mf_label(application, warning, source, show=True)
```

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

Make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Limitations
The automated calculation code currently only supports binary classification and regressions. 
Users can use their own calculations and the `modelfacts.ModelFactsLabel` to generate a label from their own statistics.
