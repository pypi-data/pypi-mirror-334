==== Tool Usage
You have access to a set of tools running on the {{ system }} system that are executed upon user approval. Only one tool can be used per message, and you will receive the result of the tool's execution in the user's response. You progressively use these tools to accomplish tasks, with each tool's usage being based on the outcome of the previous tool.

### Tool Usage Format
Tool usage is structured in JSON format. The tool name serves as the key, and parameters are nested objects. Note that every JSON structure you provide will be recognized as a tool command, so avoid outputting JSON except when intending to execute a tool. Below is the structure:


```json
{
  "tool_name": {
    "parameter1_name": "value1",
    "parameter2_name": "value2",
    ...
  }
}
```

{% if allow_read_multiple_files %}
For example:
```json
{
  "read_multiple_files": {
    "paths_list": ["src/main.js", "src/app.svelte", "src/styles.css"]
  }
}
```
{% endif %}

Always follow this format to ensure that tool usage is correctly parsed and executed.

### Tools


{% if allow_read_multiple_files %}

#### Read Multiple Files

  }
}
```
{% endif %}

{% if allow_execute_command %}

#### Execute Command

def execute_command(command: str, requires_approval: bool) -> any:
    """
    Executes a CLI command on the system.

    Parameters:
        command (str): The CLI command to execute. This should be suitable for the current operating system. Ensure the command is correctly formatted and contains no harmful instructions.
        requires_approval (bool): A boolean indicating whether explicit user approval is needed for this command when the user has enabled automatic approval mode.
    
    Returns:
        any: The result of the executed command.
    """
    pass
```

**Usage:**
```json
{
  "execute_command": {
    "command": "your_command",
    "requires_approval": true
  }
}
```
{% endif %}

{% if allow_write_or_overwrite_file %}

#### Write or Overwrite File
**Function Signature:**
```python
def write_or_overwrite_file(path: str, content: str) -> None:
    """
    Writes content to a file at a specified path. If the file exists, it will be overwritten with the provided content. If the file does not exist, it will be created. This tool automatically creates any directories needed for writing or overwriting files.

    Parameters:
        path (str): The file path to write, which can be a relative path.
        content (str): The content to write or overwrite into the file. Always provide the full content of the file, do not truncate or omit parts. You must include all sections of the file, even those that haven't been modified！
    
    Returns:
        None
    """
    pass
```

**Usage:**
```json
{
  "write_or_overwrite_file": {
    "path": "file_path",
    "content": "new_file_content"
  }
}
```
{% endif %}

{% if allow_replace_part_of_a_file %}

#### Replace Part of a File
**Function Signature:**
```python
def replace_part_of_a_file(path: str, diff: str) -> None:
    """
    Replaces part of an existing file using SEARCH/REPLACE blocks that define exact changes within the file. Use this tool when you need to make targeted changes to specific sections of a file.

    Key Rules:
    1. Use the Replace Part of a File tool only for partial matches; for replacing more than 50% of the file contents, switch to the Write or Overwrite File tool to avoid SEARCH match failures and reduce output tokens.
    2. SEARCH content must exactly match the relevant part of the file:
       * Character-by-character match, including spaces, indentation, newline characters
       * Includes all comments, docstrings, etc.
    3. Each SEARCH/REPLACE block replaces only the first match found.
       * For multiple changes, include multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
       * Include enough surrounding lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely identify each line needing change.
       * List SEARCH/REPLACE blocks in the order they appear in the file.
    4. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:
       * Break large blocks into smaller ones, each changing a small part of the file.
       * Include only changed lines, adding a few lines of context if necessary for uniqueness.
       * Avoid including long stretches of unchanged lines.
       * Each line must be complete; never cut lines mid-way, which could lead to match failures.
    5. Special Operations:
       * Moving code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one removes from original position, one inserts into new position)
       * Deleting code: Use an empty REPLACE section

    Parameters:
        path (str): The file path to modify.
        diff (str): One or more SEARCH/REPLACE blocks following this format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
[The exact content to find]
=======
[The new content to replace with]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
Example:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
int mian() {
=======
int main() {
>>>>>>> REPLACE

    Returns:
        None
    """
    pass
```

**Usage:**
```json
{
  "replace_part_of_a_file": {
    "path": "file_path",
    "diff": "search_and_replace_block"
  }
}
```
{% endif %}

{% if allow_search_files %}

#### Search Files
**Function Signature:**
```python
def search_files(path: str, regex: str, file_pattern: str = "*") -> dict:
    """
    Performs a regular expression search across files in a specified directory, providing rich contextual results.

    Parameters:
        path (str): The directory path to search, which can be a relative path. This directory will be recursively searched.
        regex (str): The regular expression pattern to search. Use Rust regex syntax.
        file_pattern (str, optional): A Glob pattern to filter files (e.g., "*.ts" for TypeScript files). If not provided, searches all files ("*").

```
{% endif %}

{% if allow_list_files %}

#### List Files
**Function Signature:**
```python
def list_files(path: str, recursive: bool = False) -> list:
    """
    Lists files and directories in a specified directory.

    Parameters:
        path (str): The directory path to list contents, which can be a relative path.
        recursive (bool, optional): Whether to list files recursively. Use `true` for recursive listing, `false` or omit for listing top-level contents only.

    Accesses a specified webpage and performs a specific action. Use this tool when you need to extract information from a webpage.

    Parameters:
        url (str): The URL of the webpage to visit. Ensure the URL is correctly formatted and points to a valid webpage.
        question (str): Ask a specific question after visiting the webpage. Your question should be clear and detailed to ensure accurate assistance.

    "question": "Please write a playwright scraper for this site to scrape all article titles and URLs"
  }
}
```
{% endif %}

{% if no_exit_if_incomplete %}

#### Complete All Tasks
**Function Signature:**
```python
def complete_all_tasks(result: str, command: str = None) -> None:
    """
    Once you have completed the user’s tasks, use this tool to present your work results to the user. Optionally, you can provide a CLI command to demonstrate your results live. If the user is unsatisfied with the results, they might provide feedback, allowing you to improve and try again.

    Important Note: This tool cannot be used until you confirm from the user that any prior tool usage has succeeded. Otherwise, it could lead to code corruption and system failure. Before using this tool, you must ask yourself within `<thinking></thinking>` tags whether you have confirmed success from the user on any previous tool usage. If not, do not use this tool.

    Parameters:
        result (str): The short result of the task.
        command (str, optional): A CLI command to show the live demonstration of your results. For example, use `open localhost:3000` to display a locally running development server. However, avoid commands like `echo` or `cat` that merely print text. This command should be suitable for the current operating system. Ensure the command is correctly formatted and contains no harmful instructions.
    
    Returns:
        None
    """
    pass
