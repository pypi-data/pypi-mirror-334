### Overview
The audit focuses on ensuring that the `log_message` method in `klingon_tools/logtools.py` is exactly as documented in `klingon_tools/README.md` and is functional.

### Assignment
Perform a code audit on `klingon_tools/logtools.py` and confirm that all the features in the `klingon_tools/README.md` describing `log_message` are still exactly as documented and functional. Provide a report that shows the gap analysis, do not update code for this task.

### `log_message` Method

**Documentation in README.md:**
- `log_message` logs a message with a given category using all green text for INFO, yellow for WARNING, and red for ERROR.
- Args:
  - `message` (str): The message to log. Can be provided as a positional or keyword argument.
  - `category` (str, optional): The category of the message. Defaults to "INFO" but generally not used if log_message is called with the appropriate category method i.e. `LogTools.log_message.info("message")`
  - `style` (str, optional): The style of the log output. Defaults to "default".
  - `status` (str, optional): The status message to log on the far right. Defaults to "OK".
  - `reason` (str, optional): The reason for the status message, displayed in round brackets just to left of `status`. Defaults to None.

**Code in klingon_tools/logtools.py:**
- The `log_message` method is defined as a class with methods for different log levels (info, warning, error, etc.).
- It formats the log message based on the provided style and status.
- It uses ANSI escape codes for colored output.
- It supports a custom template for log messages.

**Gap Analysis:**
- The code matches the documentation in terms of functionality and arguments.
- The example usage and expected output in the README.md are consistent with the implementation.

### Conclusion
The `log_message` method in `klingon_tools/logtools.py` is exactly as
documented in `klingon_tools/README.md` and is functional. No discrepancies
were found between the documentation and the code implementation.

### Overview
The audit focuses on ensuring that the `method_state` and `command_state`
methods in `klingon_tools/logtools.py` are exactly as documented in
`klingon_tools/README.md` and are functional.

### Assignment
Perform a code audit on `klingon_tools/logtools.py` and confirm that all the
features in the `klingon_tools/README.md` describing `method_state` and
`command_state` are still exactly as documented and functional. Provide a
report that shows the gap analysis, do not update code for this task.

### `method_state` Method

**Documentation in README.md:**
- `method_state` is a decorator that logs the state of a method with a given style, status, and reason.
- Args:
  - `message` (str): The message to log.
  - `style` (str, optional): The style of the log output. Defaults to "default".
  - `status` (str, optional): The status message to log on the far right. Defaults to "OK".
  - `reason` (str, optional): The reason for the status message, displayed in round brackets just to the left of `status`. Defaults to None.

**Code in klingon_tools/logtools.py:**
- The `method_state` method is defined as a decorator.
- It captures stdout and stderr.
- It logs the state of the method with the specified style, status, and reason.
- It handles exceptions and logs errors.

**Gap Analysis:**
- The code matches the documentation in terms of functionality and arguments.
- The example usage and expected output in the README.md are consistent with the implementation.

### `command_state` Method

**Documentation in README.md:**
- `command_state` runs a list of shell commands and logs their output.
- Args:
  - `commands` (list of tuples): Each tuple contains (command, name).
  - `style` (str, optional): The style of the log output. Defaults to "default".
  - `status` (str, optional): The status message to log on the far right. Defaults to "Passed".
  - `reason` (str, optional): The reason for the status message, displayed in round brackets just to the left of `status`. Defaults to None.

**Code in klingon_tools/logtools.py:**
- The `command_state` method runs a list of shell commands.
- It captures stdout and stderr.
- It logs the output of each command with the specified style, status, and reason.
- It handles exceptions and logs errors.

**Gap Analysis:**
- The code matches the documentation in terms of functionality and arguments.
- The example usage and expected output in the README.md are consistent with the implementation.

### Conclusion
The `method_state` and `command_state` methods in `klingon_tools/logtools.py` are exactly as documented in `klingon_tools/README.md` and are functional. No discrepancies were found between the documentation and the code implementation.
