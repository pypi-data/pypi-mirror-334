# DumbJuice
DumbJuice is a Python module that simplifies the process of packaging small Python programs into self-contained installable packages. These packages can be shared with non-technical users, who only need to run a single install.bat file to install Python, set up a virtual environment, install necessary dependencies, and create a shortcut to the program on their desktop.

## Installation
To install the dumbjuice module

`
pip install dumbjuice
`

## Usage
### TLDR
* Create a dumbjuice.conf file in your projects base folder with the minimum content (replace MyProgramName with your program's name and update python_version to your python version)
```
{
  "program_name": "MyProgramName",
  "python_version": "3.11.7"
}
```
* Run `dumbjuice-build <project_folder_path>`
* Test script by running the install.bat file in `dumbjuice_build/`
* Send the zipped file in `dumbjuice_dist` to those you want

### Full instructions
#### Recommended project structure
```
project_folder/
│
├── main.py                 # Your main program file 
├── dumbjuice.conf          # Configuration file for DumbJuice
├── .gitignore (optional)   # Git ignore file (optional)
├── requirements.txt        # Your program's dependencies (if any)
├── djicon.ico (optional)   # Optional icon file for the application
│
├── some_folder/            # Additional folders (optional)
│   ├── other_file.py       # Other Python files
│   └── subfolder/          # Nested subfolders (optional)
│       └── another_file.py
│
└── other_script.py         # Additional Python script files (optional)
```
#### Configuration
The build function needs a json configuration file (dumbjuice.conf) with the following:

```
{
  "program_name": "MyProgramName",
  "python_version": "3.11.7",
  "gui": false,
  "ignore": ["*.git", "*.gitignore"],
  "use_gitignore": true,
  "include": ["my_module.py"]
}
```

`program_name`: The name of your program. (\*)<br>
`python_version`: The Python version to be installed (e.g., "3.8.10") (\*)<br>
`gui`: Set to `true` if your program requires a GUI; set to `false` for console programs (default)<br> 
`ignore`: A list of files or directories to be excluded from the build<br>
`use_gitignore`: Set to `true` if you want to use .gitignore rules to determine which files to exclude<br>
`include`: A list of files or directories that should always be included, even if they are in the ignore list<br>

\* required

### Building
To build the installer for your program, navigate to the folder containing your program's files and configuration, and run the following:
```
python -m dumbjuice build <target_folder>
```

Alternatively, if you want to use the command line interface (CLI), you can use the following command:
```
dumbjuice-build <target_folder>
```
or in python
```
import dumbjuice as dj
dj.build(<target_folder>)
```
`target_folder` (optional): Path to the folder containing your python program files. If not provided, the current working directory will be used.

## What Happens During the Build Process?
* Your program files, including the `requirements.txt` and dumbjuice.conf, are copied into a new folder structure in `dumbjuice_build/appfolder/`
* A `build.ps1` file is created that is responsible for installing the program and necessary modules for the user is added `dumbjuice_build/appfolder/`
* An `install.bat` file which initiates the `build.ps1` on the users end when started is added to `dumbjuice_build/`
* The entire `dumbjuice_build` folder is zipped and added to `dumbjuice_dist`

## What happens during the install process?
* DumbJuice looks for already existing DumbJuice installation and adds it if necessary
* DumbJuice script creates the program structure in `/DumbJuice/Programs/<program_name>` and copies over the files in `appfolder/`
* DumbJuice script install the defined python version (if not present in DumbJuice already), creates a venv for the program and installs all modules defined in `requirements.txt`
* DumbJuice script creates shortcuts for the user which starts the program

## Starting a program
Simply double click the generated <program_name> shortcut, either on the Desktop or in the `/DumbJuice/programs/<program_name>` folder

## Debugging
Sometimes there may be uncaught errors that causes program crashes. 
There is a `/DumbJuice/programs/<program_name>_debug` shortcut that leaves a command line open for debugging if needed
