# PYPI PYTHON STUDY RESOURCES
This is a simple idea of grouping my notes and study material in a single space, 
thus creating a PyPi module where everyone can access these.

## Installation and Use
Install the module from PIP:
```bash
pip install gobbezlearningtoolbox
```

Use the module in your code:
```bash
import gobbezlearningtoolbox
```
