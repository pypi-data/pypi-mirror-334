    Define return type for MPyC coroutines and expose it to send calls in an outer method.

    This function just delegates the call to the original definition of `returnType` in
    `mpyc.asyncoro`. Unfortunately, the type annotations are lost though in
    `mpc.returnType` due to the use of `staticmethod` which does not preserve overloads
    (mypy, v1.8.0). Alternatively, users could call `mpyc.asyncoro.returnType` directly but this
    seems counterintuitive and is hard to figure out. By exposing the method in
    `tno.mpc.mpyc.stubs` it is clearer that the standard mpc.returnType approach may not yield the
    expected results and we can provide this explanation.

    :param return_type: The class type of the object(s) to be returned
    :param \*dimensions: Arguments that describe the dimensions of the nested list to be returned.
        If no dimensions are provided, a single placeholder is returned. If one or more dimension
        is provided, it returns a nested list containing objects. The nesting is done according to
        the dimensions provided.
    :param wrap: If True, wrap the result into an Awaitable object.
    :return: A placeholder or nested list of placeholders (wrapped in an awaitable object) to
        expose the placeholder to an outer wrapper/coroutine.
