This is the documentation for the `SAES` python library, which is a Python library designed to analyze and compare the performance of different algorithms across multiple problems automatically. The tool allows you to: 

1. **Seamless CSV data processing**  

   - Import and preprocess experiment results effortlessly.  
   - Handle datasets of varying sizes with ease.  

2. **Statistical analysis**  

   - **Non-parametric tests**:  

     - Friedman test 
     - Friedman aligned-rank test
     - Quade test   
     - Wilcoxon signed-rank test 
   - **Parametric tests**:

     - T-Test
     - Anova 
   - **Post hoc analysis**:  
   
     - Nemenyi test (critical distance)

3. **Report generation** 

   - Automated LaTeX **Median table** report
   - Automated LaTeX **Median table with Friedman test** report
   - Automated LaTeX **Median table with Wilcoxon pairwise test (pivot-based)** report
   - Automated LaTeX **Pairwise Wilcoxon test table (1-to-1 comparison)** report 
   - Automated LaTeX **Friedman P-Values table (for multiple friedman test variations)** report
   - Automated LaTeX **Mean table with Anova test** report
   - Automated LaTeX **Mean table with T-Test pairewise test (pivot-based)** report
   - Automated LaTeX **Pairwise T-Test table (1-to-1 comparison)** report

4. **Visualization**  

   - **Boxplot graphs** for algorithm comparison.  
   - **Critical distance plots** for statistical significance.  
   - **Multiobjetive Pareto Front plots** in the `multiobjective` module (more info at `Multiobjective <https://jMetal.github.io/SAES/configure/multiobjective.html>`_). 
   - **HTML generation** for intuitive analysis.
   - **Bayesian Posterior Plot** for probabilistic comparison of algorithm performance.
   - **Violin Plot** for algorithm performance distribution.
   - **Histogram Plot** for visualizing the distribution of algorithm performance.

   
This tool is aimed at researchers and developers interested in algorithm benchmarking studies for artificial intelligence, optimization, machine learning, and more.

Context
=======

A stochastic algorithm is an algorithm that incorporates randomness as part of its logic. This randomness leads to variability in outcomes even when applied to the same problem with the same initial conditions. Stochastic algorithms are widely used in various fields, including optimization, machine learning, and simulation, due to their ability to explore larger solution spaces and avoid local optima. Analyzing and comparing stochastic algorithms pose challenges due to their inherent randomness due to the fact that single run does not provide a complete picture of its performance; instead, multiple runs are necessary to capture the distribution of possible outcomes. This variability necessitates a statistical-based methodology based on descriptive (mean, median, standard deviation, ...) and inferential (hypothesis testing) statistics and visualization.

Installation
============

To install the project, you need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies. You will need to have Python 3.10 or higher installed on your system. Before installing the project, we recommend creating a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

.. warning:: 
   This project is currently in **BETA VERSION** and still has work in progress. We recommend using it with caution and reporting any issues you encounter to ensure the project's stability and reliability.

Once you have activated the virtual environment, you can install the project and its dependencies using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install SAES

.. toctree::
