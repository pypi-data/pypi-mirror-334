Multiobjective Files 
====================

`SAES` now has the capability to generate the pareto front for multiobjective optimization problems. The pareto front is generated for a specific metric and instance in 2D, 3D, or higher dimensions. The pareto front can be generated for all metrics in the dataset but in 
order to use this functionality, you need to provide the library with the necessary files containing the results of the experiments and the configuration for analysis. You can find a nice tutorial on how to setup and use the `SAES` multiobjective module at `Multiobjective <https://github.com/jMetal/SAES/tree/main/notebooks/multiobjective/multiobjective_fronts.ipynb>`_.
