Data File
---------
The `Data File` is a CSV file containing the results of the experiments. Each row in the file represents the performance of an algorithm on a specific problem. SAES assumes that the results of comparative study between a number of algorithms is provided in a CSV file with this scheme:

- **Algorithm** (string):  Algorithm name.
- **Instance** (string): Instance name. 
- **MetricName** (string): Name of the quality metric used to evaluate the algorithm performace on the instance. 
- **ExecutionId** (integer): Unique identifier for each algorithm run .
- **MetricValue** (double): Value of the metric corresponding to the run.
