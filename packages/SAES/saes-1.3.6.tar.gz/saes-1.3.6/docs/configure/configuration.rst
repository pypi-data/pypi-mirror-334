Configuration 
=============

As we have seen in the previous section, this library is designed to compare the performance of different algorithms across multiple problems. To do this, you need to provide the library with the necessary information about the experiments you want to analyze. This information is stored in two 
CSV files: one containing the results of the experiments and another containing the configuration for analysis.
