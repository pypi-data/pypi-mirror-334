# MOYA - Meta Orchestration framework for Your Agents

MOYA is a reference implementation of our research paper titled "Engineering LLM Powered Multi-agent Framework for Autonomous CloudOps". The framework provides a flexible and extensible architecture for creating, managing, and orchestrating multiple AI agents to handle various tasks autonomously.

Preprint of the paper can be accessed at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08243).

## Features

- **Agent Management**: Create, register, and manage multiple AI agents.
- **Orchestration**: Orchestrate conversations and tasks across multiple agents.
- **Memory Tools**: Integrate memory tools to maintain conversation context and history.
- **Streaming Responses**: Support for streaming responses from agents.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend the framework with new agents, tools, and orchestrators.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Install required dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install .
  ```

### Quick Start Examples

#### OpenAI Agent

Interactive chat example using OpenAI agent with conversation memory.

```python
# filepath: ~/github/moya/examples/quick_start_openai.py

python -m examples.quick_start_openai

```

#### Bedrock Agent

Interactive chat example using BedrockAgent with conversation memory.

```python
# filepath: ~/github/moya/examples/quick_start_bedrock.py

AWS_PROFILE=my_profile_name python -m examples.quick_start_bedrock
```

#### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Example demonstrating multi-agent orchestration with language and task classification.

```python
# filepath: ~/github/moya/examples/quick_start_multiagent.py

python -m examples.quick_start_multiagent
```

#### Dynamic Agent Creation
