		queue.append( Case, case_instance )
		queue.size(Case) # --> 1
		queue.append( Case, another_case_instance )

		# The above call impacts the Person queue, not the Case queue
		queue.size(Case) # --> 2
		queue.append( Case, third_case_instance )

		# The above call will trigger queue.save( Case ) after the third case is appended to the queue
		queue.append( Case, fourth_case )

				The unique_key can also be set in the subclass definition, and then not provided here on init.
