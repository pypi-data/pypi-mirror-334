Biskit is a modular, object-oriented Python library for structural
 bioinformatics research. It facilitates the manipulation and analysis
 of macromolecular structures, protein complexes, and molecular
 dynamics trajectories. For efficient number crunching, Biskit objects
 tightly integrate with numpy. Biskit also offers a platform for the
 integration of external programs and new algorithms into complex
 workflows. Calculations are thus often delegated to established
 programs like Xplor-NIH, Amber, Delphi, T-Coffee, TMAlign, Reduce and
 Modeller.
