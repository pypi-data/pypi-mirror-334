For every .py file, identify all the import statements. An import statement is any line that starts with 'import ' or 'from ' followed by any text. Then randomize the order of these import statements completely, while leaving the rest of the file unchanged. For example, if there are multiple import statements at the beginning or throughout the file, shuffle their order randomly and replace them in the file at their original positions. Do not alter any other lines in the file.
