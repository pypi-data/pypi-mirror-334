## Unified Interface for ML Lifecycle Management

### Background
In todayâ€™s data-driven AI era, model development has evolved from traditional single-model training into a complex end-to-end engineering process. As AI applications deepen in industrial scenarios, data governance in the traditional internet domain has primarily focused on storage layers such as data warehouses and data lakes. However, data governance in industrialized AI scenarios is far more intricate. Beyond managing the storage and governance of raw data, it also involves handling intermediate data generated during feature engineering, versioning of training datasets, and more. The quality of this data directly impacts model performance.

Compared to data applications in the traditional internet domain, the data pipeline in AI for Science (AI4S) scenarios is longer and more interdependent. From the collection of raw data to the training data processed through feature engineering, to the experimental data generated during model training, and finally to the deployed model filesâ€”each step produces a vast array of assets that require tracking and management. This complexity necessitates the establishment of a comprehensive data and model management system.

### Problem Statements
- [Fragmented Training](#fragmented-training) : The current machine learning (ML) training process is disjointed and lacks a unified management approach. Algorithm developers are operating in a "black box" manner, with no standardized specifications for training code, environment setup, or scenario definitions. Everyone is working independently, leading to inconsistent training standards, uncoordinated code management, and a lack of model standardization.
- [Incomplete Data and Model Lifecycle](#incomplete-data-and-model-lifecycle) : Data used in each ML process (metadata), such as file paths, versions, and specific files, is not centrally recorded and is instead scattered across individual personal directories. Similarly, training-related parameters, metrics, and statuses (including model training status and data lifecycle states like quality) associated with models are inadequately tracked, making it difficult to ensure consistency and reliability.
- [Lack of Visualized Management](#lack-of-visualized-management) : Currently, operations are command-line based, with no clear visual interface for managing models and data. Elements such as checkpoints, performance indicators, and versions from the training process cannot be effectively retrieved, shared, or served, exacerbating the management challenges.

### Use Manual

##### Installation

```bash
pip install sais-prism-sdk
```

##### Configuration (example)
The configuration file `sais_foundation.yaml` is mandatory. This file is used to configure the tool for project-level settings. If not found, the tool will throw an error.

There are three main sections in the configuration file: `foundation`, `unified_data_access`, and `ml`. The foundation is used to configure the experiment name, while the unified_data_access section is used to configure the data access settings, and the ml section is used to configure the MLflow settings.
```yaml
foundation:
  experiment_name: "example_sft" # The name of the experiment

            cls._ml_instance = MLflowManager(config.ml)
        return cls._ml_instance
```

## Model Evaluation

After training your SFT model, you can evaluate its performance using our evaluation framework. The SDK provides tools to generate custom evaluation datasets and measure model performance against standardized metrics.

### Step 1: Generate Evaluation Dataset

First, create an evaluation dataset using the `generate_evaluation_dataset.py` script:

```bash
python examples/generate_evaluation_dataset.py --output examples/evaluation_dataset.jsonl
```

This script generates a JSONL file containing pharmaceutical domain test questions for evaluating your model. You can:
- Control the number of questions with `--num_questions`
- Customize the output path with `--output`
- Modify the script to add your own domain-specific questions

The evaluation dataset follows this format:
```json
{"instruction": "What are the different classifications of the drug Imatinib?", "input": "", "output": "Expected detailed response about Imatinib classifications..."}
```

### Step 2: Run Model Evaluation

Evaluate your fine-tuned model against the evaluation dataset:

```bash
python examples/evaluate_sft_model.py --model_path ./fine_tuned_model --evaluation_file examples/evaluation_dataset.jsonl
```

Additional command-line options:
- `--max_samples N`: Limit the number of samples to evaluate
- `--max_new_tokens N`: Set maximum generation length (default: 200)
- `--output_file PATH`: Specify custom output file path

### Step 3: Review Evaluation Results

The evaluation script calculates performance metrics including:

1. **ROUGE scores** (measuring text overlap with reference answers):
   - ROUGE-1: Word unigram overlap
   - ROUGE-2: Word bigram overlap
   - ROUGE-L: Longest common subsequence

2. **BLEU score** (measuring translation quality)

3. **Generation performance**:
   - Tokens per second
   - Generation time

Sample evaluation summary from a recent run:
```
===== EVALUATION SUMMARY =====
rouge1: 0.2845
rouge2: 0.1421
rougeL: 0.2234
bleu: 0.0857
avg_tokens_per_second: 21.98
avg_generation_time: 9.10
total_samples: 10

Detailed results saved to artifacts/sft_evaluation_results_20250226_105423.json
```

### Evaluation Artifacts and Storage

Following project standards, all evaluation artifacts are stored in the `artifacts` directory with appropriate metadata:

1. **Evaluation Results**: The JSON file containing detailed evaluation metrics is stored with proper versioning according to semver standards
   ```
   artifacts/evaluation_results/sft_evaluation_results_v1.0.1_20250226.json
   ```

2. **Model Metadata**: Each evaluation includes tags for:
   - Framework (pytorch)
   - Task type (language-model)
   - Base model
   - Evaluation dataset information

3. **MLflow Integration**: All evaluation metrics are automatically tracked in MLflow, allowing for:
   - Comparison between model versions
   - Visualization of performance trends
   - Correlation between hyperparameters and evaluation metrics


### Example Evaluation Question and Response

The investigational drug AR-12 is classified into different types based on its pharmacological profile, mechanism of action, and potential therapeutic applications. Here are some of the different classification types associated with AR-12:

1. **Antiviral**: AR-12 is classified as an antiviral drug...
[truncated]

Reference answer:
AR-12 is classified as a small molecule inhibitor targeting PDK1 in the PI3K/AKT pathway. It's also categorized as an anti-cancer agent, anti-viral compound, and autophagy modulator.
