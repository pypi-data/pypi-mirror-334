**SES Conda**: A simple concept of SES `Conda` language

*Update log*:
2.0.0`-dev`  **GRAND UPDATE!** We've used `scikit-learn` to advance the accuracy and efficiency of our sentimental prediction function. Well, it's not perfect yet (((  
Please notice that during step-3 of calculation, `numpy.linalg` may fail due to dimensional complexity. Therefore, it is not able to process complex or multi-dimensional data yet. We are trying to fix it soon )   

-------
