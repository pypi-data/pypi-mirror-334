## Synopsis

Generalized & powerful time-series class and related functions.

## Contents

This library defines a powerful time-series representation based on the well-known ```pandas``` DataFrames. However, it adds meta-data as well as conveniently built-in filtering & alignment routines for both value and time dimension. Moreover, the central time-series objects can be constructed from *nearly any 1D data* such that handling of various sources in a standardised way is made possible (e.g. regularly-sampled sensor data, event logs as well as audio streams).

As of now, this package is structured into the following modules:

**zeit**: main module, defining classes ```TimeSeries``` and special ```TimeSpec``` as well as some helpers

**imex**: routines for the automatic mass import, conversion & aggregation of data from (many!) CSV-files (e.g. proper extraction of all individual time-series hidden in event logs)

**utils**: helpers and routines for general analysis of TimeSeries objects and operators on two arbitrary objects (involving a routine to make objects "coherent" in time)

**xutils**: special conversion utilities for CSV-files containing DFT spectra as generated by the software "CMS X-Tools" (Siemens AG).
