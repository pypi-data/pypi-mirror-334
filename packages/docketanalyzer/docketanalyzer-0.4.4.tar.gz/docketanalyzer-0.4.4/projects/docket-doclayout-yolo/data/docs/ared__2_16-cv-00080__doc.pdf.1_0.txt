<line: 32> CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT

[TEXT]
<line: 34> Plaintiff, ARcare d/b/a Parkin Drug (Plaintiff'), on behalf of itself and all others
<line: 35> similarly situated, brings this Complaint against IMS Health Inc. ("Defendant') for violations of
<line: 36> the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Plaintiff seeks certification of its claims against
<line: 37> Defendant as a class action. In support, Plaintiff states as follows:

[TITLE]
<line: 39> INTRODUCTION

[TEXT]
<line: 41> 1.
<line: 42> This case challenges Defendant's policies and practices of faxing unsolicited
<line: 43> advertisements without providing an opt-out notice as required by law.

[TEXT]
<line: 45> 2.
<line: 46> Congress enacted the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA'), 47 U.S.C. g
<line: 47> 227, to regulate the fast-growing expansion of the telemarketing industry. As is pertinent here,
<line: 48> the TCPA and its implementing regulations prohibit persons within the United States from
<line: 49> sending advertisements via fax without including a detailed notice that allows recipients to
<line: 50> expeditiously opt out of receiving future solicitations.

[TEXT]
<line: 52> 3.
<line: 53> Junk faxes disrupt recipients' peace, drain recipients' paper, ink, and toner, and
<line: 54> cause recipients tangible damages. Junk faxes also cause recipients to waste valuable time
<line: 55> retrieving and discerning the purpose of the faxes; prevent fax machines from receiving and
<line: 56> sending authorized faxes; and cause undue wear and tear on recipients' fax machines. Plaintiff1231231

<line: 4> offers pharmaceutical services and must use its fax machine to receive communications about
<line: 5> patients. That purpose is impeded when Plaintiff's fax machine is invaded by junk faxes.

[TEXT]
<line: 7> 4.
<line: 8>  The TCPA provides a private right of action and statutory damages of $500 per
<line: 9> violation, which may be trebled when the violation is willing or knowing.

[TEXT]
<line: 11> 5.
<line: 12> On behalf of itself and all others similarly situated, Plaintiff brings this case under
<line: 13> the TCPA to recover declaratory relief, damages for violations of the TCPA, and an injunction
<line: 14> prohibiting Defendant from future TCPA violations.

[TITLE]
<line: 16> JURISDICTION AND VENUE

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 6.
<line: 19> This Court has jurisdiction over Defendant because at all relevant times
<line: 20> Defendant has transacted business within the State of Arkansas through sending facsimiles to.
<line: 21> Arkansas residents. Defendant also receive revenue from business they transact in Arkansas.

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 7.
<line: 24> This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff's TCPA claim pursuant to
<line: 25> 28 U.S.C. s 1331.

[TEXT]
<line: 27> 8.
<line: 28> Venue in this district is proper because this is the district in which a substantial
<line: 29> part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred and where a substantial part of the property
<line: 30> that is the subject of this action is situated.

[TITLE]
<line: 4> FACTS

[TEXT]
<line: 6> 11.
<line: 7> On May 11, 2015, Defendant sent an unsolicited advertisement to Plaintiff's ink-
<line: 8> and-paper facsimile machine. The fax advertises services offered by Healthcare Data Solutions--
<line: 9> which is owned completely by IMS Health Incorporated. A copy of this facsimile is attached
<line: 10> hereto and marked as Exhibit A.

[TEXT]
<line: 12> 12.
<line: 13> Exhibit A is exemplary of the junk faxes Defendant sends..
<line: 14> 13.
<line: 15> Upon information and belief, Plaintiff has received multiple fax advertisements.
<line: 16> from Defendant similar to Exhibit A. Indeed, between March 21, 2016 and June 15, 2016
<line: 17> Defendant sent at least 5 additional unsolicited faxes to Plaintiff's ink-and-paper facsimile
<line: 18> machines. See attached Exhibit B, a compilation of 5 faxes sent to Plaintiff by Defendant. Upon
<line: 19> information and belief, Plaintiff has received hundreds of additional fax advertisements from
<line: 20> Defendant similar to Exhibit A..

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 14.
<line: 23> Defendant did not have Plaintiff's prior express invitation or permission to send.
<line: 24> advertisements to Plaintiff's fax machine..

[TEXT]
<line: 26> 15.
<line: 27> Defendant's faxes do not contain opt-out notices that comply with the.
<line: 28> requirements of the TCPA.

[TITLE]
<line: 30> CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

[TEXT]
<line: 32> 16.
<line: 33> In accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of the
<line: 34> following class of persons (the "Class"):.

[TEXT]
<line: 36> All persons and entities who hold telephone numbers that
<line: 37> received a facsimile transmission from Defendant at any time.
<line: 38> within the applicable statute of limitations to present (the
<line: 39> "Class Period") that 1) promotes Defendant's products and 2)
<line: 40> contains an opt-out notice identical or substantially similar to.

[TITLE]
<line: 4> that contained on the facsimile advertisement attached as
<line: 5> Exhibit A to the Complaint.

[TEXT]
<line: 7> 17.
<line: 8> Plaintiff reserves the right to modify or amend the definition of the proposed
<line: 9> Class before the Court determines whether certification is proper, as more information is gleaned
<line: 10> in discovery.

[TEXT]
<line: 12> 18.
<line: 13> Excluded from the Class are Defendant, any parent, subsidiary, affiliate, or
<line: 14> controlled person of Defendant, as well as the officers, directors, agents, servants, or employees
<line: 15> of Defendant and the immediate family members of any such person. Also excluded are any
<line: 16> judge who may preside over this case and any attorneys representing Plaintiff or the Class.

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 19.
<line: 19> Numerosity [Fed R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1)]. The Members of the Class are so numerous
<line: 20> that joinder is impractical. Upon information and belief, Defendant has sent illegal fax
<line: 21> advertisements to hundreds if not thousands of other recipients..

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 20.
<line: 24> Commonality [Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2)]. Common questions of law and fact apply
<line: 25> to the claims of all Class Members and include (but are not limited to) the following:.

[TEXT]
<line: 27> (a) Whether Defendant sent faxes advertising the commercial availability of
<line: 28> property, goods, or services;
<line: 29> (b) The manner and method Defendant used to compile or obtain the list of fax
<line: 30> numbers to which it sent Exhibit A and other fax advertisements;
<line: 31> (c) Whether Defendant faxed advertisements without first obtaining the
<line: 32> recipient's prior express permission or invitation;
<line: 33> (d) Whether Defendant's advertisements contained the opt-out notice required by
<line: 34> law;
<line: 35> (e) Whether Defendant sent the fax advertisements knowingly or willfully;
<line: 36> (f)Whether Defendant violated 47 U.S.C.  227;

[ABANDON]
<line: 2> Case 2:16-cv-00080-JLH Document 1 Filed 05/27/16 Page 5 of 17

[TEXT]
<line: 4> (g) Whether Plaintiff and the other Class Members are entitled to actual and/or
<line: 5> statutory damages;
<line: 6> (h) Whether the Court should award treble damages; and.
<line: 7> (i) Whether Plaintiff and the other Class Members are entitled to declaratory,
<line: 8> injunctive, and/or other equitable relief..

[TEXT]
<line: 10> 21.
<line: 11> Typicality [Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3)]. Plaintiff's claims are typical of the claims
<line: 12> of all Class Members. Plaintiff received an unsolicited fax advertisement from Defendant during
<line: 13> the Class Period. Plaintiff makes the same claims that it makes for the Class Members and seeks
<line: 14> the same relief that it seeks for the Class Members. Defendant has acted in the same manner
<line: 15> toward Plaintiff and all Class Members.

[TEXT]
<line: 17> 22.
<line: 18> Fair and Adequate Representation [Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4)]. Plaintiff will fairly
<line: 19> and adequately represent and protect the interests of the Class. It is interested in this matter, has
<line: 20> no conflicts, and has retained experienced class counsel to represent the Class.

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 23.
<line: 23> Predominance and Superiority [Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)]. For the following
<line: 24> reasons, common questions of law and fact predominate and a class action is superior to other
<line: 25> methods of adjudication:

[TEXT]
<line: 27> (a) Proof of Plaintiff's claims will also prove the claims of the Class without the
<line: 28> need for separate or individualized proceedings;
<line: 29> (b) Evidence regarding defenses or any exceptions to liability that Defendant
<line: 30> may assert will come from Defendant's records and will not require
<line: 31> individualized or separate inquiries or proceedings;.
<line: 32> (c) Defendant has acted and continue to act pursuant to common policies or
<line: 33> practices in the same or similar manner with respect to all Class Members;

<line: 2> Case 2:16-cv-00080-JLH Document 1 Filed 05/27/16 Page 6 of 17

[TEXT]
<line: 4> (d) The amount likely to be recovered by individual Members of the Class does
<line: 5> not support individual litigation. A class action will permit a large number of
<line: 6> relatively small claims involving virtually identical facts and legal issues to.
<line: 7> be resolved efficiently in one proceeding based on common proofs;

[TEXT]
<line: 9> (e)This case is inherently well-suited to class treatment in that:

[TEXT]
<line: 11> (i) Defendant identified persons or entities to receive their fax.
<line: 12> transmissions, and it is believed that Defendant's computer and
<line: 13> business records will enable Plaintiff to readily identify Class
<line: 14> Members and establish liability and damages;
<line: 15> (ii)
<line: 16>  Common proof can establish Defendant's liability and the damages
<line: 17> owed to Plaintiff and the Class;
<line: 18> (iii) Statutory damages are provided for in the statutes and are the same for
<line: 19> all Class Members and can be calculated in the same or a similar
<line: 20> manner;
<line: 21> (iv) A class action will result in an orderly and expeditious administration.
<line: 22> of claims, and it will foster economies of time, effort, and expense;
<line: 23> (v)  A class action will contribute to uniformity of decisions concerning
<line: 24> Defendant's practices; and
<line: 25> (vi) As a practical matter, the claims of the Class are likely to go
<line: 26> unaddressed absent class certification.

<line: 4> CLAIM FOR RELIEF
<line: 5> Violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act
<line: 6> 47 U.S.C. s 227(b)(1)(C) and 47 C.F.R. g 64.1200(a)(4)

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference each of the preceding paragraphs as
<line: 9> though fully set forth herein.

[TEXT]
<line: 11> 25.
<line: 12>  The TCPA provides strict liability for sending fax advertisements in a manner that
<line: 13> does not comply with the statute. Recipients of fax advertisements have a private right of action
<line: 14> to seek an injunction or damages for violations of the TCPA and its implementing regulations. 47
<line: 15> U.S.C. g 227(b)(3).

[TEXT]
<line: 17> 26.  The TCPA makes it unlawful to send any "unsolicited advertisement' via fax.
<line: 18> unless certain conditions are present. 47 U.S.C.  227(b)(1)(C). "Unsolicited advertisement"' is
<line: 19> defined as "any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property,
<line: 20> goods, or services which is transmitted to any person without that person's prior express
<line: 21> invitation or permission, in writing or otherwise." 47 U.S.C. s 227(a)(5).

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 27.
<line: 24>  Unsolicited faxes are illegal if the sender and recipient do not have an
<line: 25> "established business relationship." 47 U.S.C.  227(b)(1)(C)(i). "Established business
<line: 26> relationship' is defined as "a prior or existing relationship formed by a voluntary two-way
<line: 27> communication between a person or entity and a business or residential subscriber with or
<line: 28> without an exchange of consideration, on the basis of an inquiry, application, purchase or
<line: 29> transaction by the business or residential subscriber regarding products or services offered by
<line: 30> such person or entity, which relationship has not been previously terminated by either party." 47
<line: 31> U.S.C.  227(a)(2); 47 C.F.R.  64.1200(f)(6).

[TEXT]
<line: 33> 28.
<line: 34>  Regardless of whether the sender and recipient have an established business
<line: 35> relationship, and regardless of whether the fax is unsolicited, a faxed advertisement is illegal

<line: 4> unless it includes an opt-out notice on its first page that complies with the TCPA's requirements
<line: 5> See 47 U.S.C.  227(b)(1)(C)(iii); 47 C.F.R. s 64.1200(a)(4)(iv). To comply with the law, an opt-
<line: 6> out notice must (1) inform the recipient that the recipient may opt out of receiving future faxes
<line: 7> by contacting the sender; (2) provide both a domestic telephone number and a facsimile machine.
<line: 8> number-- one of which must be cost-free-that the recipient may contact to opt out of future
<line: 9> faxes; and (3) inform the recipient that the sender's failure to comply with an opt-out request
<line: 10> within thirty days is a violation of law. See 47 U.S.C. s 227(b)(2)(D); 47 CFR s
<line: 11> 64.1200(a)(4)(iii).

[TEXT]
<line: 13> 29.
<line: 14> Defendant faxed unsolicited advertisements to Plaintiff that did not have
<line: 15> compliant opt-out notices, in violation of 47 U.S.C. s 227(b)(1)(C) and 47 C.F.R. s
<line: 16> 64.1200(a)(4).

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 30.
<line: 19> Defendant knew or should have known (a) that Plaintiff had not given express
<line: 20> invitation or permission for Defendant to fax advertisements about its products; (b) that
<line: 21> Defendant's faxes did not contain a compliant opt-out notice; and (c) that Exhibit A is an
<line: 22> advertisement.

[TEXT]
<line: 24> 31.
<line: 25> Defendant's actions caused actual damage to Plaintiff and the Class Members.
<line: 26> Defendant's junk faxes caused Plaintiff and the Class Members to lose paper, toner, and ink
<line: 27> consumed in the printing of Defendant's faxes through Plaintiff's and the Class Members' fax
<line: 28> machines. Defendant's faxes cost Plaintiff and the Class Members time that otherwise would
<line: 29> have been spent on Plaintiff's and the Class Members' business activities.

[TEXT]
<line: 31> 32.
<line: 32>  In addition to statutory damages (and the trebling thereof), Plaintiff and the Class
<line: 33> are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief under the TCPA.
