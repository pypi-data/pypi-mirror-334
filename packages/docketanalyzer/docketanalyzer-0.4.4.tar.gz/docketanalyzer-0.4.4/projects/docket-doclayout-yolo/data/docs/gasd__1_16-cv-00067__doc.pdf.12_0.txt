[TITLE]
<line: 30> MAGISTRATE JUDGE’S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION 
<line: 31> _________________________________________________________ 

[TEXT]
<line: 33> Plaintiff brought the above-captioned case pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and is 
<line: 34> proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis (“IFP”).  For the reasons set forth below, the Court 
<line: 35> REPORTS and RECOMMENDS this case be DISMISSED without prejudice and this civil 
<line: 36> action be CLOSED. 

[TEXT]
<line: 38> Plaintiff filed the above-captioned case on February 8, 2016.  (Doc. no. 1.)  On June 
<line: 39> 29, 2016, the District Court of the Middle District of Georgia granted Plaintiff IFP and 
<line: 40> transferred the case to the Southern District.  (Doc. no. 7.)  On September 21, 2016, this 
<line: 41> Court screened Plaintiff’s complaint, finding it arguably stated claims for relief and ordering 
<line: 42> the United States Marshals to commence service upon Defendant.  (Doc. no. 10.)  Plaintiff’s 
<line: 43> service copy of the September 21st Order was returned as undeliverable because Plaintiff 
<line: 44> was released September 20, 2016.  (Doc. no. 11.)  Plaintiff has not informed the Court of his 
<line: 45> new address since his release and the Court is now saddled with a stagnant case in which no 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> communication with Plaintiff is possible. 

[TEXT]
<line: 4> A district court has authority to manage its docket to expeditiously resolve cases, and 
<line: 5> this authority includes the power to dismiss a case for failure to prosecute or failure to 
<line: 6> comply with a court order.  Equity Lifestyle Props., Inc. v. Florida Mowing & Landscape 
<line: 7> Serv., Inc., 556 F.3d 1232, 1240 (11th Cir. 2009) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b)); see also 
<line: 8> Eades v. Alabama Dep’t of Human Res., 298 F. App’x 862, 863 (11th Cir. 2008) (“District 
<line: 9> courts possess the ability to dismiss a case . . . for want of prosecution based on two possible 
<line: 10> sources of authority:  Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b) or their inherent authority to manage their 
<line: 11> dockets.”).  Furthermore, the Local Rules of the Southern District of Georgia dictate that an 
<line: 12> “assigned Judge may, after notice to counsel of record, sua sponte . . . dismiss any action for 
<line: 13> want of prosecution, with or without prejudice . . . [for] failure to prosecute a civil action 
<line: 14> with reasonable promptness.”  Loc. R. 41.1(c).   

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Here, Plaintiff’s failure to update his address or indicate that he wishes to pursue this 
<line: 17> case amounts not only to a failure to prosecute, but also an abandonment of his case.  This is 
<line: 18> precisely the type of neglect contemplated by the Local Rules.  Further, the lack of an 
<line: 19> updated mailing address leaves the Court with no way to communicate with Plaintiff.  
<line: 20> Consequently, a dismissal without prejudice is appropriate.
