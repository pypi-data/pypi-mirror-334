[TITLE]
<line: 20> ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> Before the Court is the motion to transfer venue to the Northern District of Texas, Dallas 
<line: 23> Division, (Dkt. 6), by Defendant Southwest Airlines (“Southwest”). After reviewing the briefs, 
<line: 24> pleadings, and relevant law, the Court GRANTS the motion.  

[TITLE]
<line: 26> I. Background 

[TEXT]
<line: 28> Plaintiff Leonardo Browning (“Browning”), formerly employed as a flight attendant, was 
<line: 29> terminated by Southwest on May 16, 2015. (Compl., Dkt. 1-1, ¶ 4.3). Browning alleges that his 
<line: 30> termination and Southwest’s failure to reinstate him after his termination violated the Family and 
<line: 31> Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”), 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq., and the prohibition of discrimination on the 
<line: 32> basis of race and disability under Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code. (Id. ¶¶ 5.2–5.4). Southwest 
<line: 33> avers that Browning was terminated for violating company policy regarding availability while on 
<line: 34> reserve assignment and that doing so did not violate either statute under which Browning has 
<line: 35> brought claims. (Mot. Transfer, Dkt. 6, at 3). Southwest filed a motion to transfer venue to the 
<line: 36> Dallas Division of the Northern District of Texas. (Id.).  

[TITLE]
<line: 38> II. Discussion 

[TEXT]
<line: 40> Transfer of venue to “any other district or division” where a civil action may have been 
<line: 41> brought initially is permitted for “the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of 

[ABANDON]
<line: 43> 1 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> justice.” 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). Accordingly, in considering a motion to transfer venue, the Court must 
<line: 3> determine (1) “whether the judicial district to which transfer is sought would have been a district in 
<line: 4> which the claim could have been filed,” In re Volkswagen AG, 371 F.3d 201, 203 (5th Cir. 2004), and 
<line: 5> (2) whether transferring the case would be convenient for the parties and witnesses and in the 
<line: 6> interest of justice. Id. The Fifth Circuit has laid out a number of both private and public factors to 
<line: 7> consider when deciding whether transfer would be appropriate once it has been determined that the 
<line: 8> action could have been brought originally in the transferee forum. See Action Indus., Inc. v. U.S. Fid. & 
<line: 9> Guar. Co., 358 F.3d 337, 340 (5th Cir. 2004). The private interest factors include: “(1) the relative 
<line: 10> ease of access to sources of proof; (2) the availability of compulsory process to secure the 
<line: 11> attendance of witnesses; (3) the cost of attendance for willing witnesses; and (4) all other practical 
<line: 12> problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious, and inexpensive.” In re Volkswagen of Am., Inc. 
<line: 13> (Volkswagen II), 545 F.3d 304, 315 (5th Cir. 2008) (en banc) (quoting In re Volkswagen AG (Volkswagen 
<line: 14> I), 371 F.3d 201, 203 (5th Cir. 2004). The public interest factors include: “(1) the administrative 
<line: 15> difficulties flowing from court congestion; (2) the local interest in having localized interests decided 
<line: 16> at home; (3) the familiarity of the forum with the law that will govern the case; and (4) the avoidance 
<line: 17> of unnecessary problems of conflict of laws or in the application of foreign law.” Id. (quoting 
<line: 18> Volkswagen I, 371 F.3d at 203). These factors are neither exhaustive nor exclusive, and no single 
<line: 19> factor is dispositive. Id. (citing Action Indus., Inc., 358 F.3d at 340).  

[TEXT]
<line: 21> Browning does not dispute that this case could have been brought in the Dallas Division of 
<line: 22> the Northern District of Texas. This leaves the remaining considerations of whether a transfer 
<line: 23> would be convenient for the parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice. Southwest puts forth 
<line: 24> five reasons to support transfer to Dallas: (1) that venue will be more convenient for the witnesses 
<line: 25> than this one; (2) Dallas offers a better ease of access to sources of proof than does Austin; (3) 
<line: 26> Browning’s choice of forum has little weight and does not outweigh the other factors; (4) a judge in 

[ABANDON]
<line: 28> 2 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> the Northern District will have no difficulty applying federal and Texas law; and (5) the Dallas 
<line: 3> Division has a stronger local interest in determining the outcome of the case than does the Austin 
<line: 4> Division. (Def.’s Mot. Transfer, Dkt. 6, at 6–9). Browning counters that transfer of venue would be 
<line: 5> inappropriate because it “would simply shift inconveniences from one party to the other,” (Pl.’s 
<line: 6> Resp., Dkt. 8, at 3). Additionally, Browning contends that it would not be very difficult for 
<line: 7> Southwest’s witnesses to travel to Austin because Southwest is an airline and could easily provide 
<line: 8> them with access to a plane. (Id.).  

[TEXT]
<line: 10> A plaintiff’s choice of venue is not an independent factor to be considered in the Section 
<line: 11> 1404 transfer analysis, but it does place the burden on the defendant to demonstrate that the new 
<line: 12> proposed venue is more convenient than the original one. Time, Inc. v. Manning, 366 F.2d 690, 698 
<line: 13> (5th Cir. 1966) (“[T]he plaintiff’s privilege of choosing venue places the burden on the defendant to 
<line: 14> demonstrate why the forum should be changed.”); see also Humble Oil & Ref. Co. v. Bell Marine Serv., 
<line: 15> Inc., 321 F.2d 53, 56 (5th Cir. 1963) (“[H]e who seeks the transfer must show good cause.”); 
<line: 16> Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 315 (“When viewed in the context of § 1404(a), to show good cause 
<line: 17> means that a moving party, in order to support its claim for a transfer, must satisfy the statutory 
<line: 18> requirements and clearly demonstrate that a transfer is ‘for the convenience of parties and witnesses, 
<line: 19> in the interest of justice.’”) (brackets omitted). Therefore, a plaintiff’s choice of venue should be 
<line: 20> preserved “when the transferee venue is not clearly more convenient than the venue chosen by the 
<line: 21> plaintiff,” but transfer should be granted “when the movant demonstrates that the transferee venue 
<line: 22> is clearly more convenient.” Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 315. Here, Southwest has shown that Dallas 
<line: 23> is clearly more convenient than Austin under the relevant factors.

[TITLE]
<line: 2> A. 
<line: 3> Private Interest  

[TEXT]
<line: 5> The two private interest factors raised both favor Dallas as a venue.1 Dallas is significantly 
<line: 6> more convenient for the witnesses who will appear in the case, and the relevant evidence is located 
<line: 7> in Dallas.  

[TITLE]
<line: 9> 1. Cost of Attendance for Witnesses 

[TEXT]
<line: 11> The cost of attendance for willing witnesses favors Dallas. All of the witnesses mentioned by 
<line: 12> Southwest are located in or near Dallas. Southwest names two material witnesses based in Dallas in 
<line: 13> its brief. (Def.’s Mot. Transfer, Dkt. 6, at 7 (naming Jamie Dotson, the Dallas Assistant Base 
<line: 14> Manager who sent Browning his termination letter, and Jenny McCormick, who attended the 
<line: 15> meeting concerning Browning’s conduct prior to his termination, as material witnesses living in or 
<line: 16> near Dallas). Jamie Dotson’s Declaration names five additional people who were involved in 
<line: 17> Browning’s termination, all of whom are based in Dallas. (Dotson Decl., Dkt. 6-1, at 2 (naming 
<line: 18> Joseph Skotnik, Browning’s Dallas-based union representative who attended the “Fact Finding 
<line: 19> Meeting” at which Browning’s violation of company policy was discussed, and four additional 
<line: 20> Dallas-based Southwest employees who were involved in a “Step 2” meeting to discuss Browning’s 
<line: 21> termination)). Browning has identified no witnesses apart from himself for whom Austin would be 
<line: 22> more convenient.  

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Dallas is more than 100 miles away from Austin, which means that the costs of attendance 
<line: 25> for the witnesses would be substantially higher in Austin than in Dallas. See Volkswagen I, 371 F.3d at 
<line: 26> 204–05 (“When the distance between an existing venue for trial of a matter and a proposed venue 
<line: 27> under § 1404(a) is more than 100 miles, the factor of inconvenience to witnesses increases in direct 
<line: 28> relationship to the additional distance to be traveled.”); Volkswagen II, 545 F. 3d at 317 (finding that 
<line: 29> the district court erred in failing to heed the “100-mile rule” set out in Volkswagen I). Browning 

[ABANDON]
<line: 31> 1 The parties have not made arguments regarding the second and fourth private interest factors—the availability of 
<line: 32> compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses and the catch-all category of miscellaneous practical problems. 

[ABANDON]
<line: 34> 4 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> contends that this distance should be discounted because Southwest, an airline company, has planes 
<line: 3> at its disposal. In addition to oversimplifying the nature of the costs of air travel, this contention 
<line: 4> leaves out considerations that the possibility of air travel do not alleviate, including travel time (and 
<line: 5> the accompanying necessity of absence from work), the need for meals and lodging, and the 
<line: 6> necessity of overnight stays. See Volkswagen I, 371 F.3d at 204 (“Additional distance means additional 
<line: 7> travel time; additional travel time increases the probability for meal and lodging expenses; and 
<line: 8> additional travel time with overnight stays increases the time which these fact witnesses must be 
<line: 9> away from regular employment.”). The logistical difficulties stemming from distant witnesses are 
<line: 10> compounded by the need to adjust schedules to accommodate the out-of-town participants in the 
<line: 11> trial. See id. (emphasizing that “the task of scheduling fact witnesses so as to minimize the time when 
<line: 12> they are removed from their regular work or home responsibilities gets increasingly difficult and 
<line: 13> complicated when the travel time from their home or work site to the court facility” is significantly 
<line: 14> longer than half an hour to an hour). 

[TITLE]
<line: 16> 2. Relative Ease of Access to Sources of Proof 

[TEXT]
<line: 18> The relative ease of access to sources of proof also favors the Dallas division. All relevant 
<line: 19> records are located in the headquarters of Southwest, which is in Dallas. According to the Dotson 
<line: 20> Declaration, “Job applications and employee personnel files are maintained at Southwest’s Dallas 
<line: 21> headquarters.” (Dotson Decl., Dkt. 6-1, at 2). Additionally, the Human Resources Department is 
<line: 22> centralized in Dallas. (Id.). Browning suggests that it would be easy for Southwest to place whatever 
<line: 23> documents may be needed onto a flash drive and transport them to Austin, but the Fifth Circuit has 
<line: 24> made clear that even in light of technological developments, the physical location of evidence is still 
<line: 25> an important factor to be considered. Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 316 (“That access to some sources 
<line: 26> of proof presents a lesser inconvenience now than it might have absent recent developments does 
<line: 27> not render this factor superfluous.”). Even if it were relatively easy to transport the relevant 

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> 5 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> documents to Austin, "the question is relative ease of access, not absolute ease of access," In re Redmax,
<line: 3> Ltd., 720 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir. 2013) (citing Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 316), and the proximity of a
<line: 4> Dallas court to the location of the relevant evidence makes that venue more convenient than this
<line: 5> one. Because all relevant documents and other sources of evidence are located in Dallas, this factor.
<line: 6> favors Dallas as the venue for this suit.

[TITLE]
<line: 8> B.
<line: 9> Public Interest

[TEXT]
<line: 11> The only public interest factor at issue is the interest "in having localized interests decided at.
<line: 12> home." V/olkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 317. Austin's only connection to the case is that Browning resides
<line: 13> here. All of the other factors point to Dallas---Southwest is headquartered in Dallas, Browning was
<line: 14> employed in Dallas, the meeting in which Browning was terminated occurred in Dallas, and all of
<line: 15> Southwest's witnesses live in Dallas. Cf. V/olkswagen I, 371 F.3d at 205 (finding that the district court.
<line: 16> erred in failing to consider the site of the car accident at issue in the case). Austin has barely any.
<line: 17> local interest at all in the dispute; it primarily concerns Dallas. Therefore, this factor favors venue in
<line: 18> Dallas, as well.

[TITLE]
<line: 20> 111. Conclusion

[TEXT]
<line: 22> Because the Volkswagen factors considered together clearly favor Dallas as a venue over
<line: 23> Austin, Southwest's motion to transfer venue, (Dkt.6), is GRANTED. IT IS ORDERED that the
<line: 24> case is TRANSFERRED to the Dallas Division of the Northern District of Texas.
