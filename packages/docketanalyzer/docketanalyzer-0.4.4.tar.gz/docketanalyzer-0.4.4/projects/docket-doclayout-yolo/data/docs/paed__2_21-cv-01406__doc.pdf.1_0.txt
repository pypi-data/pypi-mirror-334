[TEXT]
<line: 19> Plaintiffs, K7 Design Group, Inc. and K7 Design Group, LLC, by their attorneys, as and.
<line: 20> for their Complaint against defendant, Five Below, Inc. ("Five Below'), allege as follows:.

[TITLE]
<line: 22> INTRODUCTION

[TEXT]
<line: 24> 1.
<line: 25> This action arises from an enormous miscalculation by the defendant, Five Below,
<line: 26> which grossly over-ordered more than $2 million worth of hand sanitizer and soap in the midst of.
<line: 27> a worldwide pandemic from the plaintiffs, K7, a family-owned business. Five Below placed
<line: 28> substantial orders to take advantage of a worldwide spike in demand for hand sanitizer and soap.
<line: 29> But Five Below apparently ordered way more than it could sell. The reason was simple - Five
<line: 30> Below and other retailers placed massive orders of hand sanitizer and soap and supply ultimately
<line: 31> outstripped demand. Rather than accept responsibility for its misjudgment, Five Below has.
<line: 32> improperly sought to shift the blame to its supplier, K7.

[TEXT]
<line: 34> 2.
<line: 35> Once Five Below realized it had over-ordered not only did it refuse to pay for or to
<line: 36> accept delivery of the hand sanitizer and soap that K7 had manufactured specifically for Five.
<line: 37> Below, it denied having placed the order despite the robust paper trail confirming the orders..

[TEXT]
<line: 39> 3.
<line: 40> Because Five Below reneged, K7 has been left with a large quantity of hand
<line: 41> sanitizer and soap for which K7 has no other use. And, after it refused to take delivery, Five Below

[TEXT]
<line: 4> sought to use its market power to force K7 to absorb losses that, both in contract and equity, should
<line: 5> be borne by Five Below.

[TEXT]
<line: 7> 4.
<line: 8>  In early 2020, the Novel Coronavirus ("COviD-19') quickly spread around the
<line: 9> globe, ravaged millions, and imposed enormous demands on health systems. COvID-19 led people
<line: 10> to take extraordinary precautions to avoid infection and spread.

[TEXT]
<line: 12> 5.
<line: 13> Before the COvID-19 pandemic, hand sanitizer and soap, common consumer
<line: 14> products, were plentiful in retail establishments and widely available for purchase. Supply and
<line: 15> demand were in balance. With the onset of the pandemic, public health authorities advised people
<line: 16> that to avoid contracting the virus, they should exercise good hygiene including, amongst other
<line: 17> things, frequently washing or sanitizing their hands. Hand sanitizer and soap quickly flew off store
<line: 18> shelves and became largely unavailable by the spring of 2020. Supply and demand were suddenly
<line: 19> out of balance.

[TEXT]
<line: 21> 6.
<line: 22> Against this backdrop, Five Below, with more than 800 retail stores, moved quickly
<line: 23> to fill its customers' dire need for hand sanitizer and soap. Upon information and belief, to capture
<line: 24> supply, Five Below placed orders with multiple suppliers and manufacturers.

[TEXT]
<line: 26> 7.
<line: 27> Five Below approached K7 to produce large quantities of hand sanitizer and soap
<line: 28> so that Five Below could provide it to its customers throughout the United States.

[TEXT]
<line: 30> 8.
<line: 31> K7 is a New York-based, family-owned manufacturer and distributor of consumer
<line: 32> products sold under the "Ultra Defense" brand label. K7 has spent three decades in the health and
<line: 33> wellness space, producing private-label and branded products for many of the nation's largest
<line: 34> retailers, as well as for warehouse clubs and smaller local establishments. By March 2020, K7 had
<line: 35> been producing hand sanitizer and related products for many years.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 9.
<line: 5>  As described herein, in the spring of 2020, Five Below committed to purchase more
<line: 6> hand sanitizer and soap than it could use and then proceeded to shift to K7 the economic burdens
<line: 7> that flowed from Five Below's misjudgment of its ability to absorb the goods it ordered into either
<line: 8> Five Below's storage facilities or its supply chain..

[TEXT]
<line: 10> 10.
<line: 11> As a result, Five Below breached and repudiated its purchase commitment, leaving
<line: 12> K7 with more than $2 million worth of hand sanitizer and soap that Five Below has refused to
<line: 13> accept and for which it has refused to pay. Five Below's breach seriously jeopardizes the
<line: 14> continued viability of K7's business..

[TEXT]
<line: 16> 11. In addition to the damages K7 has suffered because of Five Below's refusal to pay.
<line: 17> for the goods it ordered from K7, K7 has incurred tens of thousands of dollars of storage fees for
<line: 18> the product that it manufactured specifically to fulfill Five Below's order. K7 has put Five Below
<line: 19> on notice on multiple occasions that its refusal to take delivery of the hand sanitizer and soap was
<line: 20> adding to K7's losses. Nevertheless, Five Below has unjustifiably refused to take delivery of its
<line: 21> product and has created an alternative universe in which it claims to have never ordered the hand
<line: 22> sanitizer and soap. In so doing, Five Below has breached and repudiated its contractual
<line: 23> commitment to accept and pay for the specially manufactured goods.

[TITLE]
<line: 22> ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL COUNTS

[TEXT]
<line: 24> 17.
<line: 25> On April 24, 2020, Five Below reached out to K7 inquiring as to whether K7
<line: 26> "would be interested in working on a project for' Five Below. Five Below requested "a whole
<line: 27> presentation of full size soap, full size antibacterial and travel antibacterial ... Think Bath and
<line: 28> Body Works but with a Five Below twist.".

[TEXT]
<line: 30> 18.
<line: 31> On the very same day, K7 responded to the request indicating that it "would be.
<line: 32> delighted to put together a killer assortment of assorted hand sanis and soaps." K7 posed some
<line: 33> questions as to timing.

[TEXT]
<line: 35> 19.
<line: 36> On April 27, 2020, Five Below responded that the timing would be for fall but, "the
<line: 37> sooner we could execute in stores the better.".

[TEXT]
<line: 39> 20.
<line: 40> Also on April 27, 2020, K7 requested additional information from Five Below on
<line: 41> the project such as the dimensions of the store setups and the shapes of the bottles needed to
<line: 42> determine what molds would be required

<line: 2> Case 2:21-cv-01406-WB  Document1 Filed 03/24/21 Page 5 of 13

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 21.
<line: 5>  On the same day, Five Below responded with the approximate dimensions of the
<line: 6> store setups and agreed to use "in house" stock bottles for the program as opposed to creating new
<line: 7> molds which would be more costly..

[TEXT]
<line: 9> 22.
<line: 10> Also on April 27, 2020, K7 requested the projected quantity of product anticipated
<line: 11> since the main ingredient in sanitizer was in short supply due to the pandemic and K7 wanted to
<line: 12> secure enough of the ingredients to satisfy Five Below's order.

[TEXT]
<line: 14> 23.
<line: 15> On April 28, 2020, K7 provided Five Below with a nine-page color proposal with
<line: 16> imagery and styles for a line of hand sanitizers and soaps that were created specifically for Five
<line: 17> Below.

[TEXT]
<line: 19> 24.
<line: 20> On April 29, 2020, Five Below expressed its appreciation for the quick turn around
<line: 21> on the proposal and requested the cost for each item.

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 25.
<line: 24>  The following day, K7 sent Five Below an Excel spreadsheet with the cost of each
<line: 25> item that was contained in the proposal.

[TEXT]
<line: 27> 8 oz. Hand Sanitizer @$2.10 per unit
<line: 28> 8 oz. Hand Soap @ $2.10 per unit
<line: 29> Light up case with hand sanitizer @ $2.50 per unit
<line: 30> Hand Sanitizer with lip balm @ $1.30 per unit
<line: 31> Scallop sleeve hand sanitizer @ $2.00 per unit
<line: 32> Character assorted hand sanitizer @ $1.20 per unit

[TEXT]
<line: 34> 26.
<line: 35> On May 1, 2020, Five Below advised K7 that it was reviewing the costs internally
<line: 36> and would have an update the following week.

[TEXT]
<line: 38> 27.
<line: 39> Also on May 1, 2020, Five Below requested the information regarding the
<line: 40> percentage of alcohol content in the sanitizers and K7 responded the very same day.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 28.
<line: 5>  Also on May 11, 2020, Five Below wrote to K7 exclaiming that senior management
<line: 6> "absolutely loved" the presentation and "based on what we have already committed to," the plan
<line: 7> was for the goods to be used for the spring market and the unit counts would be provided..

[TEXT]
<line: 9> 29.
<line: 10> On the same day, K7 advised Five Below that because of demand, K7 needed to.
<line: 11> know the unit counts promptly in order to ensure the capacity to meet Five Below's deadlines.

[TEXT]
<line: 13> 30.
<line: 14> On May 14, 2020, Five Below advised K7 that it did not have an individual.
<line: 15> breakdown by item but "would be looking at approximately 1.2M units" in total. By return email,
<line: 16> K7 indicated that in order to put the order into production, it needed to know the exact counts on
<line: 17> a time sensitive basis

[TEXT]
<line: 19> 31.
<line: 20> On the same day, Five Below provided a breakdown by product category and style
<line: 21> and stated that there were a "couple [of] prices" that still needed to be worked out ("Ordered
<line: 22> Products").

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Light up case with hand sanitizer - 100,000 units
<line: 25> Hand sanitizer with lip balm - 100,000 units.
<line: 26> : Scallop sleeve hand sanitizer - 100,000 units
<line: 27> Character assorted hand sanitizer - 300,000 units

[TEXT]
<line: 29> 32.
<line: 30> After an exchange of emails, on May 14, 2020, K7 asked Five Below to "please.
<line: 31> confirm the costs [previously provided] are acceptable so we can begin and not risk losing our
<line: 32> production.".

[TEXT]
<line: 34> 33.
<line: 35> On the same day, Five Below requested that K7 "please confirm based on the
<line: 36> units...provided.".

[TEXT]
<line: 38> 34.
<line: 39> The email exchange on May 14 concluded with K7 stating "this is confirmed and.
<line: 40> [we] will work with [our] team in getting these in the pipeline." Thus, a contract was born.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 35.
<line: 5> On May 15, 2020, K7 requested case pack and assortment breakdown for the.
<line: 6> Ordered Products which Five Below confirmed by email dated May 18, 2020

[TEXT]
<line: 8> 36.
<line: 9> On May 21, 2020, K7 confirmed that it successfully [was] able to pull the
<line: 10> production trigger and secure the necessary space for all of our items and assortment ..." and
<line: 11> requested the paperwork for vendor and item setup.

[TEXT]
<line: 13> 37.
<line: 14> On July 15, 2020, K7 was provided its vendor number from Five Below (3580).
<line: 15> 38.
<line: 16> On July 20, 2020, K7 sent Five Below the updated New Item Forms for each of the
<line: 17> Ordered Products.

[TEXT]
<line: 19> 39.
<line: 20> On August 17, 2020, K7 confirmed that it had sent samples of the Ordered Products.
<line: 21> to Five Below, that it had completed testing of the EDI system (Electronic Data Interchange), and
<line: 22> that K7 was "officially in the production stage ready to accept and receive EDI transmits."

[TEXT]
<line: 24> 40.
<line: 25> On September 17, 2020, K7 advised Five Below that the Ordered Products were
<line: 26> available earlier than anticipated and in K7's warehouses. K7 inquired as to when the EDI
<line: 27> documents would be received so that the Ordered Products could be allocated amongst the stores.

[TEXT]
<line: 29> 41.
<line: 30> Having received no response, on September 29, 2020, K7 followed up with Five.
<line: 31> Below and confirmed that the Ordered Products had arrived at K7's warehouse and K7 was.
<line: 32> awaiting EDI instructions as to allocation and shipment.

[TEXT]
<line: 34> 42.
<line: 35> After apologizing for the delay in responding, on September 30, 2020, Five Below.
<line: 36> acknowledged that it had over-ordered hand sanitizer and soap and found itself in the unenviable
<line: 37> position of supply out-distancing demand. As a result, Five Below was unable to take in all of the
<line: 38> Ordered Products which K7 made specifically for Five Below.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 43.
<line: 5> Although Five Below contended that it was "completely committed' to taking all
<line: 6> the travel size items, the shipment of those items would have to be accomplished over an extended
<line: 7> period of time.

[TEXT]
<line: 9> 44.
<line: 10> With regard to the larger size hand sanitizers and soap, Five Below could not
<line: 11> commit to taking those items until it reviewed the sales of the holiday assortments.

[TEXT]
<line: 13> 45.
<line: 14>  The inadequate response at the salesperson level forced K7 to elevate the issue to
<line: 15> Below Five's "leadership team," which it did on November 2, 2020, and recounted the history of
<line: 16> Five Below requesting the Ordered Products.

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 46.
<line: 19> After much prodding, a telephone call was finally held on November 18, 2020, in
<line: 20> which Five Below conceded that it had purchased too much product but nevertheless stated that it
<line: 21> could not accept the Ordered Products because a purchase order was not issued.

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 47.
<line: 24>  Nevertheless, as a follow up, Five Below asked for samples of the Ordered.
<line: 25> Products, which had been previously sent in August, and the expiration date of the Ordered
<line: 26> Products.

[TEXT]
<line: 28> 48.
<line: 29>  K7 sent additional samples on December 1, 2020 and provided the expiration date
<line: 30> (2023).

[TEXT]
<line: 32> 49.
<line: 33> Having heard nothing further from Five Below, K7 reached out on December 7
<line: 34> 2020 to follow up.

[TEXT]
<line: 36> 50.
<line: 37> Again, receiving no response from Five Below, K7 reached out again on December
<line: 38> 11, 2020.

[TEXT]
<line: 40> 51.
<line: 41> Finally, Five Below responded on December 11, 2020 stating that it was sending
<line: 42> out the travel sanitizers "to be tested for the 70% requirement of alcohol," even though there was
<line: 43> no such prior requirement.

<line: 4> 52.
<line: 5>  Five Below also "reiterate[ed] we are at this time unable to take any of the travel
<line: 6> anti-bac. We will continue to assess but I continue to recommend you try to sell to other accounts
<line: 7> as it is your brand. I know this is not the response you were looking for but the retail challenges.
<line: 8> in this category remains."

[TEXT]
<line: 10> 53.
<line: 11>  K7 responded on the same day stating that it would have been happy to provide
<line: 12> testing results if they were requested, that there was no alternate market for the Ordered Products,.
<line: 13> as Five Below was previously informed, and that Five Below's inability to take the Ordered
<line: 14> Products is not an adequate response.

[TEXT]
<line: 16> 54.
<line: 17> Once again, Five Below did not respond and K7 reached out on December 12, 2020.
<line: 18> 55.
<line: 19> On December 22, 2020, Five Below responded that it was still waiting for the
<line: 20> testing, but "[o]nce again, I must reiterate we are not able to take any of the product.'

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 56.
<line: 23>  K7 responded the same day by inquiring as to the purpose of the testing if "you
<line: 24> don't want to take the merchandise ordered by 5 Below,"' and stating that if Five Below's position
<line: 25> does not change, K7 would have no choice but to exercise its legal rights..

[TEXT]
<line: 27> 57.
<line: 28>  The same day, Five Below provided the testing results and stated that it did "not
<line: 29> appreciate [K7's] tone.'

[TEXT]
<line: 31> 58.
<line: 32>  In a follow up email the same day, Five Below stated, for the first time, that it was
<line: 33> "not able to place an order for this product as it does not meet applicable standards."

[TEXT]
<line: 35> 59.
<line: 36>  Finally, by email dated January 5, 2021, Five Below reiterated that it was not
<line: 37> prepared to accept any of the Ordered Products, which were specifically manufactured for it,.
<line: 38> because Five Below "neither issued a purchase order for the product, nor did it pass [Five Below's].
<line: 39> testing protocols."

<line: 27> 64.
<line: 28> As a result of Five Below's breach and repudiation, K7 has been left with

<line: 38>  Instead of admitting it had ordered too much hand sanitizer and soap and working

<line: 5> Due to the worldwide COvID-19 pandemic and consequent widespread and

<line: 4> Commitment, including many thousands of bottles, bottle caps, and labels necessary to unitize the
<line: 5> Ordered Products for the consumer market, as Five Below had ordered..

[TEXT]
<line: 7> 77.
<line: 8>  In communications with K7 after making the Purchase Commitment, Five Below
<line: 9> continued to express its expectation and desire to receive the Ordered Products.

[TEXT]
<line: 11> 78.
<line: 12>  Despite Five Below's Purchase Commitment and subsequent communications with
<line: 13> K7, Five Below thereafter refused to accept the Ordered Products.

[TEXT]
<line: 15> 79.
<line: 16> K7 relied to its detriment on Five Below's Purchase Commitment, in that K7
<line: 17> produced the Ordered Products, specifically at Five Below's request and without an alternate
<line: 18> purchaser.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> 80.
<line: 21> By the time Five Below reneged on its Purchase Commitment, K7 had already
<line: 22> manufactured all of the Ordered Products, including bottles, bottle caps, and labels.

[TEXT]
<line: 24> 81.
<line: 25>  Five Below has refused to take delivery of, or to pay for, the Ordered Products in
<line: 26> the amount of not less than $2 million..

[TEXT]
<line: 28> 82.
<line: 29> As a result, K7 has been damaged in an amount not less than $2 million, plus the
<line: 30> cost of storing Five Below's merchandise, pre-judgment interest, and other damages, which K7.
<line: 31> will prove at trial.

[TEXT]
<line: 33> 83.
<line: 34>  Basic fairness and justice require that Five Below compensate K7 for the loss K7
<line: 35> incurred by relying on Five Below's broken promise..

[TEXT]
<line: 37> 84.
<line: 38>  K7 demands a trial by jury with regard to all the issues in this case..
<line: 39> WHEREFORE, K7 demands judgment against Five Below as follows:.

[TEXT]
<line: 41> 1.
<line: 42> On Count I, in an amount to be determined by the Court, but in no event less than
<line: 43> $2 million, plus the cost of storing Five Below's goods, and pre-judgment interest;
