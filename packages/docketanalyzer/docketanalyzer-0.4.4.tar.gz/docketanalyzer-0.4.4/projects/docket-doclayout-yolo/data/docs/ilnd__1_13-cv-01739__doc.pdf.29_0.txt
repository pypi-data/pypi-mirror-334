[TITLE]
<line: 22> MEMORANDUM ORDER

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Michael Ruffin-El (Ruffin-El”), whose prior pleadings have been filed under the names
<line: 25> Michael Houston Ruffin Jr. (in the caption of the original Complaint) and simply Michael Ruffin (in
<line: 26> the caption of his later Motion for Summary Judgment), has filed an Amended Complaint on the
<line: 27> same June 17th day that he appeared to present his summary judgment motion.  That Amended
<line: 28> Complaint was intended in principal part, as Ruffin-El stated orally on the presentment date, to
<line: 29> address the motion by defendant Saint-Gobain Containers, Inc. (“Saint-Gobain”)1 to dismiss the
<line: 30> Complaint (1) as untimely filed and (2) in part because of Ruffin-El’s asserted failure to exhaust his
<line: 31> administrative remedies.  This memorandum order is issued to address Saint-Gobain’s motion to
<line: 32> dismiss in light of the Amended Complaint.

[TEXT]
<line: 34> As for the timeliness issue, the original Complaint had stated that Ruffin-El had received
<line: 35> EEOC’s right-to-sue letter on December 9, 2012 (Complaint ¶ 8(b)), which would bring the March 6,
<line: 36> 2013 filing date of the Complaint within the 90-day time frame allowed by statute.  That was
<line: 37> puzzling, because the photocopy of the right-to-sue letter attached as a Complaint Exhibit showed
<line: 38> a September 25, 2012 mailing date.

[ABANDON]
<line: 40> 1Ruffin-El mistakenly sued Saint-Gobain under the name set out in the caption of this
<line: 41> memorandum order, but in the interest of accuracy the correct name will be used in the text.

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Now the Amended Complaint has attached a photocopy of an envelope that jibes with the
<line: 3> September 25 mailing date but is then stamped with the legend “Return to Sender,  Not Deliverable
<line: 4> as Addressed, Unable To Forward” and with a September 30, 2012 date.  What Ruffin-El has failed
<line: 5> to provide is something to support his allegation about having later received the right-to-sue letter
<line: 6> more than two months later, on December 9, 2012.

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Ruffin-El has also provided an unsatisfactory response to the exhaustion-of-remedies
<line: 9> branch of Saint-Gobain’s motion.  Here is what Ruffin-El stated in his Charge of Discrimination
<line: 10> (emphasis added) filed with EEOC on July 25, 2011:

[TEXT]
<line: 12> I believe that I was discriminated against because of my race.  Black, in violation of
<line: 13> Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.  Also, I believe I was
<line: 14> discriminated against because of my disability, in violation of the Americans with
<line: 15> Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended.

[TEXT]
<line: 17> Yet Ruffin checked off in Complaint ¶ 9 that he was the victim of discrimination because of his color
<line: 18> and national origin, in addition to the two grounds underlined above as specified in the Charge of
<line: 19> Discrimination.

[TEXT]
<line: 21> In that respect, one attachment to the Amended Complaint contains this statement:

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 4.)  The Defendant’s (Saint Gobain Containers) claim in #4 are baseless and without
<line: 24> merit.  The Defendant’s Agent or Counsel lacks the depth of perception, that as a
<line: 25> Moorish American all “marks” (or trademarks) have been placed on the Plaintiff and
<line: 26> his ancestry.  As a Moorish American the Plaintiff is Sovereign in his National Origin,
<line: 27> in addition the Plaintiff (Michael Ruffin El), was marked as Black, Negro and/or
<line: 28> Colored.  The Plaintiff took exhaustive measures to allow for negotiation with
<line: 29> Defendant, therefore the “Right to Sue” notice from EEOC is the “prerequisite”
<line: 30> before filing the private lawsuit in Federal Court.

[TEXT]
<line: 32> The Plaintiff affirms that as a Moorish American he uniquely suffers from all marks
<line: 33> or “trademarks” placed upon human property and/or slaves.

[TEXT]
<line: 35> This Court sees no problem with the Complaint’s inclusion of discrimination based on color, for the
<line: 36> Charge of Discrimination does  refer to “Black”, which was the most common term previously used
<line: 37> to refer to the color of African Americans as well as to their race.  But the same cannot be said of
<line: 38> “national origin,” as to which Ruffin-El’s mindset as reflected in the above quoted statement does

[ABANDON]
<line: 40> 2

[TEXT]
<line: 2> not conform to the common understanding and intended meaning of that term. Unless Ruffin-El
<line: 3> can provide something more persuasive, Saint-Gobain's motion to strike that assertion on non
<line: 4> exhaustion grounds will be granted.

[TEXT]
<line: 6> This Court has earlier set July 3 as the due date for Ruffin-EI's response, and the same date
<line: 7> has been set for the next status hearing. Because this Court has no desire to compel Ruffin-El to
<line: 8> make the long trip to the courthouse,? if he can manage to file his response in time so that this
<line: 9> Court can read it over before the July 3 status date, it would be much appreciated. If, however, it
<line: 10> is inconvenient for him to submit his filing until July 3, this Court will accept it at that time. 3

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 2Ruffin-El should understand that he need not make a trip from Arizona to be in Court for
<line: 19> the July 3 status hearing. If he wishes to participate by telephone instead, he should provide this
<line: 20> Court with his Arizona telephone number before the status date, and this Court's courtroom deputy
<line: 21> will place a call so that he can participate telephonically.

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 3 Ruffin-El should understand that this is not a modification of this Court's earlier
<line: 24> schedulings.
