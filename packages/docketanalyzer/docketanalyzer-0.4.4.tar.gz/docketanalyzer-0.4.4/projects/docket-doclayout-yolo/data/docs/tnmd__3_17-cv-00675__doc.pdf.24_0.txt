<line: 39> PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT 

[TEXT]
<line: 41> The Plaintiffs, through undersigned counsel, respectfully file this Motion for Default 
<line: 42> Judgment pursuant to Rule 55(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   

[TEXT]
<line: 44> In its January 19, 2018 Order, the Court instructed the Defendant to either obtain counsel 
<line: 45> to enter a notice of appearance or notify the Court of her intention to proceed pro se by no later 
<line: 46> than January 31, 2018. (Doc. #23 at 2.) The Court warned that the Defendant’s failure to comply 
<line: 47> with this requirement would result in a recommendation by the Court for an entry of default 
<line: 48> judgment against the Defendant. (Id.) The Defendant has failed to comply with the Court’s Order. 
<line: 49> The Plaintiffs therefore respectfully request that the Court enter a default judgment against the 
<line: 50> Defendant for the amount stipulated in the Complaint (Doc. #1) and in the Plaintiff’s Proposed 
<line: 51> Initial Case Management Order (Doc. #21) of $289,517.25 plus interest, reasonable attorney's fees, 
<line: 52> and any measures the Court considers just and equitable for the Plaintiff Norma Pantoja and 
<line: 53> $286,760.00 plus interest, reasonable attorney's fees, and any measures the Court considers just 
<line: 54> and equitable for the Plaintiff Janeth Adriana Barragan Cruz.
