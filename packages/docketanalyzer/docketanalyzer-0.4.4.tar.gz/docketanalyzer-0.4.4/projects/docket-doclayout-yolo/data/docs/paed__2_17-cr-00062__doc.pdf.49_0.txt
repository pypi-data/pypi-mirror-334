[TITLE]
<line: 15> MEMORANDUM 

[TEXT]
<line: 17> Defendant Raheem Pleasant stands accused of taking part in four robberies.  He was 
<line: 18> arrested following an investigation that involved a number of law enforcement techniques. 
<line: 19> Several pretrial motions have been filed, and following briefing, a full evidentiary hearing was 
<line: 20> held, rendering the motions now ripe for resolution.  

[TITLE]
<line: 22> 1) Defendant’s Motion to Suppress Physical Evidence 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Defendant Pleasant seeks to suppress physical evidence found in his car—a fake gun, two 
<line: 25> ski masks, and plastic bags—because he believes his arrest and the subsequent search of his car 
<line: 26> violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. 

[TEXT]
<line: 28> Following a bank robbery that occurred on January 2, 2017, police reviewed the security 
<line: 29> camera footage from the bank and nearby businesses.  As a result of that review, they were able 
<line: 30> to identify a burgundy sedan with two missing hub caps.  In addition to the missing hubcaps, the 
<line: 31> vehicle had a rear spoiler, tinted windows, two window visors, and a prominent Chevrolet 
<line: 32> Impala logo on the side pillar.  A Philadelphia police detective assigned to the Violent Crimes 
<line: 33> Task Force pondered the suspects’ likely route of travel and, following his intuition, continued to 
<line: 34> gather footage from available surveillance cameras to trace its path.  On one recording, the 
<line: 35> detective observed an item being thrown from the suspect vehicle that visually appeared to have 

[ABANDON]
<line: 37> 1 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> fluttered to the ground.  Upon site inspection he recovered a black scarf.  Later, approximately 
<line: 3> one block away, the detective recovered two black gloves along the car’s route of travel.  

[TEXT]
<line: 5> A description of the car was broadcast, and on January 10, 2017, Philadelphia police 
<line: 6> officers located the vehicle parked approximately five miles from the site of the robbery.  The 
<line: 7> license plate was communicated to the case investigators, who determined through records that it 
<line: 8> was owned by Defendant Raheem Pleasant.  They then compared surveillance photographs from 
<line: 9> the bank with the Pennsylvania Bureau of Motor Vehicle photo for Mr. Pleasant, as well as with 
<line: 10> photos in a law enforcement database, and positively identified him as one of the two bank 
<line: 11> robbers.  In the bank surveillance photographs, one of the robbers can be shown to be wearing a 
<line: 12> black scarf, partially covering his face with it, and two black gloves. 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> The FBI agent assigned to the case, Special Agent Percy Giles, proceeded to the scene 
<line: 15> where the car was parked.  When Mr. Pleasant returned to the vehicle he was asked to 
<line: 16> accompany the agent to the FBI offices in Philadelphia.  The Government does not dispute that 
<line: 17> this constituted an arrest.  As the FBI was questioning Mr. Pleasant, officers from Upper Darby 
<line: 18> Township in Delaware County presented an arrest warrant in connection with one of the other 
<line: 19> open bank robbery cases, and Defendant was remanded into their custody.  That same day, 
<line: 20> Philadelphia police were instructed to impound the vehicle.  Also on January 10, Mr. Pleasant’s 
<line: 21> girlfriend was shown photographs from the bank surveillance camera, and positively identified 
<line: 22> him as one of the robbers.  The Government secured a federal arrest warrant on January 12, 
<line: 23> 2017, secured a warrant to search the car on January 17, and ultimately conducted the search on 
<line: 24> January 18, finding ski masks, a fake firearm that was consistent in appearance with the handgun 
<line: 25> seen on the bank surveillance video and as described by witnesses, and crumpled plastic bags 
<line: 26> similar to ones used in the robberies. 

[ABANDON]
<line: 28> 2 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> On these facts, I have a little hesitation in denying the Motion to Suppress.  Thoughtful 
<line: 3> and diligent police work making use of surveillance cameras provided investigators with a clear 
<line: 4> description of the vehicle.  When Philadelphia police located the vehicle, a comparison of 
<line: 5> available photographs of Mr. Pleasant provided convincing evidence that he was one of the two 
<line: 6> robbers.  For probable cause to exist, there need only be a “fair probability that the person 
<line: 7> committed the crime at issue” and the standard is met when the “facts and circumstances within 
<line: 8> the arresting officer’s knowledge are sufficient in themselves to warrant a reasonable person to 
<line: 9> believe that an offense has been committed by the person to be arrested.” Wilson v. Russo, 212 
<line: 10> F.3d 781, 789 (3d Cir. 2000); see also United States v. Edwards, No. CRIM. 11-735, 2013 WL 
<line: 11> 2256125, at *12 (E.D. Pa. May 23, 2013), aff’d, 591 F. App’x 156 (3d Cir. 2014) (finding 
<line: 12> probable cause on similar facts).  

[TEXT]
<line: 14> This leaves the question whether police had a reasonable basis upon which to seize 
<line: 15> Defendant’s car.  Florida v. White, 526 US. 559 (1999), is the controlling case.  There, the 
<line: 16> Supreme Court held that the police have authority to seize a vehicle from a public street if they 
<line: 17> have a reasonable belief that the vehicle “may have been used at some point in the past to assist 
<line: 18> in illegal activity.”  Id. at 567.  The Court held that a lesser standard was applicable because 
<line: 19> police activities such as towing a vehicle which is parked in a public street does “not involve any 
<line: 20> invasion of [the owner’s] privacy.”  Id. at 566.  The Court further noted that seizure of a vehicle 
<line: 21> can be required because of the nature of automobiles—their inherent mobility creates a risk that 
<line: 22> evidence can be lost.  Law enforcement concern over possible loss of evidence is underscored by 
<line: 23> the facts of this case, because the defendant sought to have a family member tow the car after he 
<line: 24> was arrested. 

[TEXT]
<line: 26> Arguably, the police could have searched the vehicle without securing a warrant, because 

[ABANDON]
<line: 28> 3 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> the United States Supreme Court has given the automobile exception an expansive interpretation. 
<line: 3> United States v. Donahue, 764 F. 3d 293, 295 (3d Cir. 2014).  Here, however, the agents took the 
<line: 4> additional precaution of securing a warrant before searching the vehicle.  Eight days elapsed 
<line: 5> from the time the vehicle was seized to the time it was searched, and the defense argues that in 
<line: 6> some way this undermined the existence of probable cause.  With the vehicle impounded the 
<line: 7> evidence was secure.  Furthermore, the investigators continued to accumulate more evidence, 
<line: 8> making the case for searching the vehicle that much stronger.  In the context of a warrantless 
<line: 9> search of a seized vehicle, the Third Circuit has held that a delay of five days was “immaterial,” 
<line: 10> Donovan, 764 F.3d at 300, and cited with approval one case approving a warrantless search 38 
<line: 11> days after impound, United States v. Gastiaburo, 16 F.3d 582 (4th Cir. 1994), and another 
<line: 12> upholding a search seven days after seizure, United States v. McHugh, 769 F.2d 860 (1st Cir. 
<line: 13> 1985).  See also United States v. Jones, 994 F.2d 1051 (3d Cir. 1983) (passage of two weeks 
<line: 14> between the time of the robbery and time of the search was not so long as to undermine 
<line: 15> probability that perpetrators would still have possession of the robbery proceeds).  

[TEXT]
<line: 17> In that regard, authorities here were investigating an ongoing series of bank robberies, 
<line: 18> supporting an inference that the defendant would likely still possess the handgun displayed at the 
<line: 19> various banks or other instrumentalities it used to carry out the crimes.  Once again, the record 
<line: 20> shows that such an inference is supportable, because the FBI did in fact recover the firearm, 
<line: 21> bags, and masks that appear to have been used by the robbers.  Finally, it bears emphasis that 
<line: 22> ultimately the search was conducted pursuant to a warrant that was based upon a detailed 
<line: 23> affidavit of probable cause.  The agents performing the search were entitled to rely on the 
<line: 24> presumed validity of the warrant.  United States v. Williams, 3 F.3d 69 (3d Cir. 1993).  For these 
<line: 25> reasons, the Motion to Suppress Physical Evidence will be denied.

[TITLE]
<line: 2> 2) Defendant’s Motion to Suppress Out-of-Court Identifications 

[TEXT]
<line: 4> Several witnesses to the bank robberies have viewed photo arrays and identified 
<line: 5> Defendant Pleasant as one of the bank robbers.  Defendant now argues that those identifications 
<line: 6> violated his constitutional right to due process and, as a result, the government should not be 
<line: 7> allowed to present evidence of those out-of-court identifications.   

[TEXT]
<line: 9> In evaluating the admissibility of out-of-court identifications, the standard is one of 
<line: 10> fairness under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment.  Manson v. Braithwaite, 432 U.S. 
<line: 11> 98, 113 (1977).  Within the Third Circuit, the standard is applied by using a two-step process. 
<line: 12> The court must first inquire as to whether the identification procedure was “unnecessarily 
<line: 13> suggestive,” and if so, further determine whether it “creates a substantial risk of 
<line: 14> misidentification.”  United States v. Brownlee, 454 F. 3d 131, 137 (3d Cir. 2006).  The defendant 
<line: 15> bears the burden of proving that the procedure for identification used was impermissibly 
<line: 16> suggestive. United States v. Lawrence, 349 F.3d 109, 115 (3d Cir. 2003).  “The suggestiveness of 
<line: 17> a photographic array depends on several factors, including the size of the array, its manner of 
<line: 18> presentation, and its contents.  If there is no prejudice in the manner of presentation, the primary 
<line: 19> question is whether the suspect’s picture is so different from the rest that it suggests culpability.” 
<line: 20> Reese v. Fulcomer, 946 F.2d 247, 260 (3d Cir. 1991); see also Lawrence, 349 F.3d at 115 
<line: 21> (explaining that an array is suggestive “when the circumstances surrounding [it] unduly suggest 
<line: 22> who an identifying witness should select.”). 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> In investigating the four bank robberies with which Defendant stands charged, law 
<line: 25> enforcement used three photo arrays, with multiple viewings.  Law enforcement authorities from 
<line: 26> Delaware County presented a simultaneous array of the images to a teller from the robbery that 
<line: 27> occurred on December 17, 2016.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation used two sequential arrays 

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> 5 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> consisting of six photographs each.  In the last showing of one of the sequential arrays, which 
<line: 3> took place in March 2017, a more recent photograph of the defendant was substituted.  

[TEXT]
<line: 5> On January 10, 2017, the simultaneous array was shown to the teller confronted during 
<line: 6> the December 17 robbery, and the Defendant was identified as the robber.  Also on January 10, 
<line: 7> 2017, the FBI showed the first sequential array to one of the victims of January 2, 2017 robbery, 
<line: 8> the teller confronted by the robbers, and that victim identified the defendant with 40 percent 
<line: 9> certainty.  The next day, a nearby teller who witnessed the crime viewed the same array, and 
<line: 10> identified the defendant with 100 percent certainty.  The same array was shown on January 11, 
<line: 11> 2017, to two of the witnesses from the December 23, 2016 robbery.  Both were bank employees, 
<line: 12> but neither was the teller involved.  One identified the defendant with 100 percent certainty, and 
<line: 13> the other identified him with 60 percent certainty.  Finally, the FBI showed a different sequential 
<line: 14> array, which included a more recent photograph of Defendant, to the victims of the September 
<line: 15> 15, 2016 robbery.  The teller confronted was unable to make an identification.  Without any 
<line: 16> changes to the array, it was then shown to a nearby bank employee, who chose the Defendant.  It 
<line: 17> should be noted that this final array represented the largest lapse of time, approximately six 
<line: 18> months between the robbery and the identification. 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> The witnesses the Government presented at the suppression hearing were not in a 
<line: 21> position to describe how the images were chosen for the simultaneous array used by Upper 
<line: 22> Darby police. With respect to the sequential arrays used by the FBI, computer software was used 
<line: 23> to choose the images based upon the composite descriptions provided by eyewitnesses.  In this 
<line: 24> instance, the parameters included, among other things, a “flat nose” and a particular 
<line: 25> configuration of facial hair (a goatee).  It should be noted that although the initial sampling for 
<line: 26> comparators is done by computer, at the end of the process an agent for the Government makes 

[ABANDON]
<line: 28> 6 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> the final selection of the images.  The instructions given to the witnesses who reviewed the 
<line: 3> arrays are set forth in the companying reports.  For purposes of review, the Court has both 
<line: 4> printed the images for review, and further reviewed full-color images as docketed on ECF. 

[TEXT]
<line: 6> Upon review of the photographs here I conclude that all of them depict individuals who 
<line: 7> fit the general physical description of the suspect provided by witnesses.  The facial shapes and 
<line: 8> general features of the men pictured are similar as are the shape of their noses and configurations 
<line: 9> of facial hair.  It is of course impossible to generate images that completely mirror the physical 
<line: 10> attributes of any given suspect, but the images employed here have substantial similarity.  The 
<line: 11> defense complains of differences in the complexion of the individuals in the arrays, but I do not 
<line: 12> find such differences to be striking, and in the case of the eight-photo simultaneous array, the 
<line: 13> complexion of all of the individuals is similar.  The defense also points to specific characteristics 
<line: 14> of some of the individuals in the sequential arrays, such as acne scars or other facial marking. 
<line: 15> Once again, based upon my review, I did not find any such characteristics so prominent as to 
<line: 16> render use of the photo unfair.  At the hearing, although Defendant did not testify, it was 
<line: 17> represented that in two of the arrays, he was wearing a prison jump suit (having had his picture 
<line: 18> taken before release from custody).  I will accept that representation as true.  However, contrary 
<line: 19> to counsel’s characterization of the photograph, it does not appear that Mr. Pleasant was wearing 
<line: 20> a “bright orange jumpsuit.”  Rather, in the photograph he appears to be wearing a pale red shirt.  
<line: 21> As one who has visited multiple correctional institutions in a variety of capacities, and seen 
<line: 22> many varieties of prison uniforms, until defense counsel made such an offer of proof, it was in 
<line: 23> no way apparent to me where Mr. Pleasant had been photographed.  I do not see a risk that any 
<line: 24> of the witnesses would have been influenced.  

[TEXT]
<line: 26> As to overall fairness, the Government makes a telling point. The fact that one witness, a 

[ABANDON]
<line: 28> 7 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> teller who was personally victimized, was utterly unable to make a positive identification, 
<line: 3> combined with the fact that two other witnesses identified the defendant with less than 100 
<line: 4> percent certainty, strongly suggests that the arrays were not unduly suggestive.  It is also 
<line: 5> noteworthy that two different methodologies were employed, with one array showing the 
<line: 6> photographs simultaneously, and the others sequentially.  

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Even if I were to conclude that the lineup was unduly suggestive, the identifications by 
<line: 9> the witnesses would nonetheless be admissible if they are reliable under the totality of the 
<line: 10> circumstances.  The controlling test is established by Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 199–200 
<line: 11> (1972).  Turning first to the opportunity of the witnesses to observe the defendant at the time of 
<line: 12> the crime, three of the tellers who were in close proximity were able to identify him, albeit with 
<line: 13> varying levels of certainty.  Three other bank employees had unobstructed views from several 
<line: 14> feet away—they also identified the defendant.  In each instance the bank robbed was brightly lit.  
<line: 15> See United States v. Clark, 989 F.2d 1490, 1495–96 (7th Cir. 1993) (collecting cases).  There can 
<line: 16> be little question but that the witnesses’ attention would have been focused at the time, as each 
<line: 17> witness was aware that a robbery was in the progress.  The physical descriptions were not 
<line: 18> uniform, but there was enough consistency to suggest that the witnesses observed and processed 
<line: 19> relevant identifying information.  The level of certainty on the part of the witnesses varied, with 
<line: 20> four expressing no doubt that Mr. Pleasant was the perpetrator.  As noted above, the inability of 
<line: 21> one witness, and the uncertainty of another, is paradoxically reassuring as to whether the photo 
<line: 22> arrays were unduly suggestive.  Finally, with the exception of one array, all of the identifications 
<line: 23> took place less than a month after the robberies, and in the case of the January 2, 2017 robbery, 
<line: 24> within about a week.  The longest the interval between the robbery and identification involved 
<line: 25> the September 15, 2016 robbery, when the sole witness to view a photo array did so 

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 8 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> approximately six months later.  But that nonetheless passes constitutional muster in light of the 
<line: 3> fact that the delay in Biggers was seven months. 

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Because at its heart a due process analysis of an out-of-court identification is concerned 
<line: 6> with fundamental fairness, with the goal of preventing erroneous identification, it bears emphasis 
<line: 7> that Mr. Pleasant was separately identified as the robber from surveillance photographs by 
<line: 8> people who were in close contact with him, including his probation officer, the cousin whom he 
<line: 9> asked to move his vehicle, and the mother of his child. 

[TEXT]
<line: 11> Defense counsel is correct that there might be questions as to how the lineups were 
<line: 12> conducted that are relevant, but at this juncture the issues raised are at best speculative.  As to the 
<line: 13> arrays conducted by the FBI, the standard instructions given the witnesses are set forth in the 
<line: 14> appended reports.  As to the simultaneous array used by local authorities, the defense can request 
<line: 15> an offer of proof as to the instructions given the witnesses.  If an insufficient foundation is laid as 
<line: 16> to any of the arrays, the defense can move to exclude them or strike them at trial, and, at a 
<line: 17> minimum, cross-examination might cast doubt as to their reliability.  But for present purposes, 
<line: 18> Defendant has not demonstrated a constitutional deficiency. 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> For these reasons, the Motion to Suppress Out-of-Court Identifications will be denied. 

[TITLE]
<line: 22> 3) Defendant’s Motion for a Lineup 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Defendant further requests that a pre-trial lineup be conducted.  Because the reliability of 
<line: 25> eyewitness identification is a matter for the jury, a court is under no obligation to conduct a 
<line: 26> lineup.  United State v. Sebetich, 776 F.2d 412, 420 (3d Cir. 1985).  This motion involves the 
<line: 27> same considerations relevant to determining whether the out-of-court identifications already 
<line: 28> conducted were sufficiently reliable.  Id. at 417–18.  Given that I have already concluded that the 
<line: 29> procedures followed did not create a substantial likelihood of misidentification, due process does 

[ABANDON]
<line: 31> 9 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> not require that an in person lineup be conducted.  In that regard, an additional eight months have 
<line: 3> passed, with the result that a lineup would likely prove less reliable than the more 
<line: 4> contemporaneous exercises already conducted for purposes of identification.  Once again, it 
<line: 5> bears mention that the identifications by bank employees are far from the only evidence in this 
<line: 6> case.  Defendant has been definitively identified by three individuals who knew him well; his car 
<line: 7> was definitively linked to one of the robberies; and physical evidence highly suggestive of guilt 
<line: 8> was found in his vehicle.  Then there is Mr. Pleasant’s post-arrest behavior to consider, which 
<line: 9> included the request that his cousin have the car towed, and the highly unusual request that his 
<line: 10> cousin go to his apartment to wash his clothes.1  All of that additional evidence weighs against 
<line: 11> the need to conduct an in-person lineup.  I am further persuaded that it is appropriate for me to 
<line: 12> consider the additional trauma and inconvenience to victims and witnesses in a case where there 
<line: 13> is substantial independent evidence against a defendant. 

[TEXT]
<line: 15> For these reasons, Defendant’s Motion for Pretrial Lineup will be denied. 

[TITLE]
<line: 17> 4) Cross Motions as to Audio Recordings 

[TEXT]
<line: 19> The Government’s Motion to Admit Audio Recordings will be granted, as will 
<line: 20> Defendant’s Motion to Admit Full Recordings.  At trial, if the Government seeks to play a 
<line: 21> recording, it shall simultaneously play other portions designated by the defense. 

[TITLE]
<line: 23> 5) Government’s Motion to Admit Evidence under Rule 404(b) 

[TEXT]
<line: 25> The Government seeks leave to introduce evidence that, after Mr. Pleasant was arrested, 
<line: 26> he called his cousin and asked him to go to Defendant’s apartment to wash clothing.  The 
<line: 27> Government further seeks to admit the evidence that Mr. Pleasant called his girlfriend with the 
<line: 28> request that she further contact his cousin asking him to have Defendant’s car towed from the 
<line: 29> location where he was taken into custody by the FBI.  It further seeks to admit evidence of a 

[ABANDON]
<line: 31> 1 Presumably to remove trace evidence, as discussed below. 

[ABANDON]
<line: 33> 10 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> conversation with his girlfriend that could be interpreted as a request that she change her 
<line: 3> testimony before the grand jury for the purpose of protecting him. 

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Although Rule 404(b) places limits on the admission of evidence concerning conduct, 
<line: 6> there is an exception where the evidence bears upon consciousness of the guilt.  United States v. 
<line: 7> Gatto, 995 F. 2d 449, 454 (3d Cir. 1993).  Defendant’s purpose in seeking to move his car is 
<line: 8> obvious, and the Government may introduce evidence that he made such a request.  Similarly, 
<line: 9> Defendant’s conversation with his girlfriend concerning her grand jury testimony could 
<line: 10> reasonably be construed to show consciousness of guilt.  Finally, although Defendant’s request 
<line: 11> that his cousin wash his clothes is somewhat more obscure given the facts of this case, the 
<line: 12> Government persuaded me at argument that it reflects Defendant’s concern that there might be 
<line: 13> trace evidence that could link him either to one of the victim bank tellers or to his accomplice in 
<line: 14> performing the robberies.  Particularly given the unusual nature of the request, I agree that a jury 
<line: 15> could reasonably construe such conduct as demonstrating a consciousness of guilt. 

[TEXT]
<line: 17> For these reasons, the Government’s Motion pursuant to Rule 404(b) will be granted. 

[TITLE]
<line: 19> 6) Government’s Motion to Admit Evidence under Rule 609 

[TEXT]
<line: 21> If Mr. Pleasant testifies at trial, the Government seeks leave to impeach him with two 
<line: 22> prior felony convictions, the 2008 conviction for sale of narcotics, and a 2012 conviction for 
<line: 23> robbery.  Having balanced the probative value of such evidence against its prejudicial effect to 
<line: 24> Defendant, the Government’s motion will be denied. 

[TEXT]
<line: 26> The Government further seeks leave to cross-examine any character witnesses whom 
<line: 27> Defendant might call with evidence of these prior convictions.  Within the Third Circuit, the 
<line: 28> proper scope of such a cross-examination of a character witness is controlled by United States v. 
<line: 29> Curtis.  644 F.2d 263, 267–68 (3d Cir. 1981).  Under Curtis, the relevance of prior convictions is 

[ABANDON]
<line: 31> 11 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> controlled by the testimony elicited from the witness on direct examination, and therefore the 
<line: 3> Government’s motion is not ripe for resolution at this time.  Should the defense present character 
<line: 4> witnesses at trial, the Government is instructed to seek a ruling at sidebar as to the proper scope 
<line: 5> of cross-examination before proceeding.
