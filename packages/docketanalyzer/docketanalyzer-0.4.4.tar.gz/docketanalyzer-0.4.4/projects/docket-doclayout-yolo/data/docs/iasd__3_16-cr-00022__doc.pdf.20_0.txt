<line: 23> REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION CONCERNING PLEA OF GUILTY

[TEXT]
<line: 25> The United States of America and the Defendant. having both filed a written consent
<line: 26> appeared before me pursuant to Rule 11, Fed. R. Crim. P. and L. Cr. R. 11. The Defendant.
<line: 27> entered an open plea of guilty to Counts 1, 2 and 3 of the Indictment. After cautioning and
<line: 28> examining the Defendant under oath concerning each of the subjects mentioned in Rule 11, I
<line: 29> determined that the guilty plea was knowing and voluntary as to those counts, and that the offense
<line: 30> charged is supported by an independent factual basis concerning each of the essential elements of
<line: 31> such offense. I, therefore, recommend that the plea of guilty be accepted, that a pre-sentence
<line: 32> investigation and report be prepared, and that the Defendant be adjudged guilty and have sentence.
<line: 33> imposed accordingly.
