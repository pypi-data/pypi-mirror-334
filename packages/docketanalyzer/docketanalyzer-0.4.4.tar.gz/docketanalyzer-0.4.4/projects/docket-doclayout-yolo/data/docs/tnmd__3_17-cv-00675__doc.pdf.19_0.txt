[TEXT]
<line: 33> Before the Court is Plaintiffs’ Objections to the Report and Recommendation issued by the 
<line: 34> Magistrate Judge. (Doc. No. 18.)  

[TEXT]
<line: 36> In this case, the Magistrate Judge set an initial case management conference for October 
<line: 37> 30, 2017. (Doc. No. 13.) However, neither counsel for Plaintiffs nor Defendant Perez (the only 
<line: 38> remaining Defendant), either pro se or through counsel, appeared. Additionally, neither party filed 
<line: 39> a proposed initial case management order prior to the hearing, as they had been directed to do by 
<line: 40> the Court, or contacted the Court in any manner about the case management conference or the 
<line: 41> case. Accordingly, on October 31, 2017, the Magistrate Judge issued a show cause order requiring 
<line: 42> Plaintiffs to show cause by November 14, 2017, why a recommendation should not be made to the 
<line: 43> District Judge for dismissal of this case under Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
<line: 44> because of Plaintiffs’ failure to obey the Court’s order regarding the initial case management 
<line: 45> conference and failure to prosecute. (Doc. No. 16.) Plaintiffs did not respond to the show cause 
<line: 46> order. On November 27, 2017, the Magistrate Judge issued a Report and Recommendation 
<line: 47> suggesting dismissal of this action, pursuant to Rule 16(f)(1) and Rule 41(b), due to Plaintiffs’

<line: 2> failure to comply with specific directives from the Court. (Doc. No. 17.) The Magistrate Judge 
<line: 3> noted that “[t]he 14 day period for filing objections to this Report and Recommendation will give 
<line: 4> Plaintiffs yet another opportunity to indicate their interest in prosecuting this case.” (Id. at 3.) 

[TEXT]
<line: 6> Plaintiffs have timely objected and made known their interest in prosecuting this case. 
<line: 7> (Doc. No. 18.)  Plaintiffs’ counsel has represented that the failure to attend the initial case 
<line: 8> management conference and to timely submit a response to the Magistrate Judge’s show cause 
<line: 9> order was entirely his own. Counsel states that he was in Louisiana representing a detainee in 
<line: 10> immigration proceedings. Counsel further states that notifications from CM-ECF were 
<line: 11> accidentally filtered by his e-mail service and, subsequently, never appeared in his inbox. Counsel 
<line: 12> states that he did not notice this problem at the time because he was overwhelmed preparing for 
<line: 13> six final asylum hearings that occurred in the first three weeks of October. Counsel acknowledges 
<line: 14> that “[t]his does not excuse the failure to respond timely, and the undersigned attorney takes 
<line: 15> responsibility for the failure to diligently prosecute his client’s case.” (Id. at 1-2.) 

[TEXT]
<line: 17>  It is well-settled that federal trial courts have the inherent power to manage their own 
<line: 18> dockets. Link v. Wabash R.R., 370 U.S. 626 (1961). However, in this instance, it appears to the 
<line: 19> Court that, based on the representations of Plaintiffs’ counsel, at this preliminary stage of the case, 
<line: 20> the drastic sanction of dismissal may not best serve the interests of justice.  However, neither the 
<line: 21> Court nor the Magistrate Judge will tolerate any further lapses in judgment by Plaintiffs’ counsel. 
<line: 22> Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Objections (Doc. No. 18) are SUSTAINED. The Report and 
<line: 23> Recommendation (Doc. No. 17) is SET ASIDE. This case is RETURNED to the Magistrate Judge 
<line: 24> for the scheduling of an initial case management conference. If Plaintiffs’ counsel fails to attend 
<line: 25> any required conferences or meet any other significant deadlines, the Magistrate Judge shall, after 
<line: 26> providing proper process, issue another Report and Recommendation.
