<line: 30> STATEMENT-OPINION

[TEXT]
<line: 32> This matter is before the court on the motion (pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 157(d)) of Reff
<line: 33> Properties, LLC (“Reff”) to withdraw the reference of an adversary proceeding, Donahue v.
<line: 34> Smith, et al., case number 13 A 96019, currently pending in a bankruptcy proceeding, In re
<line: 35> Pinewood Buffet & Grill Inc., case number 12 B 8334, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for
<line: 36> the Northern District of Illinois, Western Division.  In the adversary proceeding, Donahue, the
<line: 37> Chapter 7 Trustee, seeks a declaratory judgment that insurance proceeds paid by Debtor’s insurer
<line: 38> for losses resulting from a fire are property of the bankruptcy estate.  Reff filed a third-party
<line: 39> complaint against Jennifer Smith (a co-defendant with Reff in the original adversary proceeding)
<line: 40> and against Auto-Owners Insurance Company (“Auto-Owners”), Michael Woodward, and Bauer
<line: 41> Group Agency, Ltd (“Bauer”).  Smith, Auto-Owners, Woodward, and Bauer all moved to dismiss
<line: 42> Reff’s third-party complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  The bankruptcy court denied
<line: 43> Smith’s motion to dismiss Reff’s third-party complaint but granted the motion to dismiss of the
<line: 44> other third-party defendants finding that Reff’s action against them did not fall within the scope
<line: 45> of the district court’s referral of matters to the bankruptcy court as allowed by 28 U.S.C. § 157(a)
<line: 46> and provided by Internal Operating Procedure 15 of the United States District Court for the
<line: 47> Northern District of Illinois.  The bankruptcy court stayed the adversary proceeding to allow Reff
<line: 48> to file this motion to withdraw the reference and to allow this court to rule on that motion.

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Reff as a named insured.  Debtor obtained a fire insurance policy issued by Auto-Owners.  It
<line: 3> purchased the policy through Bauer and Bauer’s officer, Woodward.  The insurance binder
<line: 4> named Reff as a “mortgagee, loss payee and additional insured” but the policy ultimately issued
<line: 5> by Auto-Owners did not.  Instead, it listed Smith as an additional insured “Secured Interested
<line: 6> Party.”  A fire occurred.  Subsequent to the fire, the insurance policy was amended to show Reff
<line: 7> as an additional insured as to both the building and its contents.  Auto-Owners eventually issued
<line: 8> a check under the policy for $439,252.33 made payable jointly to Debtor, Smith and Reff for the
<line: 9> cash value of the building.  It also issued a separate check for $41,981.58 made payable jointly to
<line: 10> Debtor and Reff for the cash value of the insured contents.  Debtor, Smith, and Reff agreed to
<line: 11> deposit the insurance proceeds in escrow with a law firm until their competing claims to the
<line: 12> proceeds were resolved.  Reff filed a state court action in the Illinois Circuit Court for the 15th
<line: 13> Judicial Circuit against the same parties named in its third-party complaint in the adversary
<line: 14> proceeding seeking an adjudication against Smith that the proceeds belong to Reff and
<line: 15> indemnification from Bauer, Auto-Owners, and Woodward if the state court did not award Reff
<line: 16> the proceeds.  Donahue subsequently filed the subject adversary complaint seeking a declaratory
<line: 17> judgment that the escrowed insurance proceeds are property of the bankruptcy estate and that
<line: 18> Reff’s only claim is that of a general unsecured creditor.1

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Count VI of Reff’s third-party complaint seeks a declaratory judgment that Reff is
<line: 21> entitled to the entire insurance proceeds disbursed in the two checks referenced above free and
<line: 22> clear of any claim by Smith.  The remainder of the claims in the third-party complaint are against
<line: 23> Auto-Owners, Bauer, and Woodward (collectively, “Insurance Parties”).  Reff’s third-party
<line: 24> complaint seeks indemnification (in the event it is found not to be entitled to the insurance
<line: 25> proceeds discussed above) from the Insurance Parties (in Count I against Bauer, Count II against
<line: 26> Woodward, and Count III against Auto-Owners) for violating the Illinois statutory duty (735
<line: 27> ILCS 5/2-2201) of an insurance producer, registered firm, and limited insurance representative to
<line: 28> exercise ordinary care and skill in renewing, procuring, binding, or placing the coverage
<line: 29> requested by the insured or proposed insured.  Reff additionally seeks indemnification from
<line: 30> Auto-Owners on claims of common law negligence (Count IV) and as a disclosed third party
<line: 31> beneficiary to the insurance contract between Debtor and Auto-Owners (Count V).

[TEXT]
<line: 33> Reff moves to withdraw the reference to allow Donahue’s declaratory action against Reff
<line: 34> and Reff’s third-party claims against the Insurance Parties to proceed together in the same forum. 
<line: 35> Reff asserts this court, if it withdraws the reference, would have supplemental jurisdiction over
<line: 36> Reff’s claims against the Insurance Parties because those claims “are so related to claims in the
<line: 37> action within [the court’s] original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or
<line: 38> controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.”  28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).  The case
<line: 39> or controversy within the court’s original jurisdiction is Donahue’s action as trustee to collect

[ABANDON]
<line: 41>   According to the bankruptcy court’s memorandum opinion, Smith filed only an
<line: 42> 1
<line: 43> unsecured claim in the Debtor’s bankruptcy case and admitted in her answer to Donahue’s
<line: 44> adversary complaint that the insurance proceeds “are property of the bankruptcy estate and
<line: 45> should be paid to the same for the benefit of the estate’s creditors.”

<line: 2> property of the estate. 28 U.S.C. § 1334(e).  Such an action is automatically referred to the
<line: 3> bankruptcy court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 157(a) and Internal Operating Procedure 15 and is a
<line: 4> core proceeding in which the bankruptcy court may enter judgment.  28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(1) &
<line: 5> (b)(2)(E)&(K).  Withdrawing the reference would take the determination of this matter away
<line: 6> from the bankruptcy court and bring it to this court.  The only reason Reff seeks withdrawal is its
<line: 7> belief that this court would then exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Reff’s state law claims
<line: 8> against the Insurance Parties.  Claims that have no other basis for federal court jurisdiction.  The
<line: 9> bankruptcy court found it did not have authority to adjudicate these state law claims because
<line: 10> these claims do not arise in or relate to a case under Title 11 and therefore, were not within the
<line: 11> scope of the reference to it by Internal Operating Procedure 15 as authorized by 28 U.S.C. §
<line: 12> 157(a).  Smith is the only party opposing withdrawal of the reference.

[TEXT]
<line: 14> “The district court may withdraw, in whole or in part, any case or proceeding referred
<line: 15> under this section [28 U.S.C. § 157], on its own motion or on a timely motion of any party, for
<line: 16> cause shown.”  28 U.S.C. § 157(d).  A district court has broad discretion in determining whether
<line: 17> to withdraw the reference. See In re Beale, 410 B.R. 613, 616 (N.D. Ill. 2009) (Gottschall, J.) 
<line: 18> Various factors have been considered by courts in deciding whether cause is shown “including
<line: 19> whether the proceeding is core or non-core, considerations of judicial economy and convenience,
<line: 20> promoting the uniformity and efficiency of bankruptcy administration, forum shopping and
<line: 21> confusion, conservation of debtor and creditor resources, and whether the parties requested a jury
<line: 22> trial.” Id.   A district court has supplemental jurisdiction over state claims “so long as they derive
<line: 23> from a common nucleus of operative fact with the original federal claim.  A loose factual
<line: 24> connection is generally sufficient.”  Houskins v. Sheahan, 549 F.3d 480, 495 (7  Cir. 2008).

[TEXT]
<line: 28> The original federal claim here seeks a determination that the insurance proceeds were
<line: 29> rightly only the property of the Debtor as Debtor was the named insured at the time of the loss. 
<line: 30> A primary issue in making that determination is the insurance contract between Debtor and the
<line: 31> insurer, Auto-Owners.  The contract was procured through Bauer and Bauer’s officer,
<line: 32> Woodward.  The third-party claims relate directly to the terms of that insurance contract and the
<line: 33> process of binding the coverage.  If the allegations of the third-party complaint are true, the only
<line: 34> reason the insurance proceeds could be found under the Trustee’s claim to belong to the estate, is
<line: 35> if some or all of the Insurance Parties breached a duty or duties owed to Reff during the
<line: 36> insurance binding and issuing process resulting in Reff not being named as a “mortgagee, loss
<line: 37> payee and additional insured” as it had bargained for.  This factual connection would be close
<line: 38> enough for the court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the third-party claims if the
<line: 39> original action were pending before it. See id.

[TEXT]
<line: 41> Smith argues withdrawal of the reference is inappropriate because the purpose of the
<line: 42> bankruptcy court system is to direct all bankruptcy matters to the bankruptcy court with its well-
<line: 43> developed expertise in bankruptcy matters.  But, as Reff points out, no bankruptcy-specific issue
<line: 44> is in play in Donahue’s action.  The adversary complaint alleges Debtor was the named insured at

[ABANDON]
<line: 46> 3

[TEXT]
<line: 2> the time of the loss and that the estate is therefore entitled to the proceeds based on Debtor's
<line: 3> "named insured"' status. This is an insurance contract issue not a bankruptcy issue..

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Smith also argues that a bankruptcy court finding in the adversary proceeding that Reff is
<line: 6> entitled to the proceeds would moot the third-party indemnification claims against the Insurance
<line: 7> Parties. Only a finding in favor of the estate would necessitate a resolution of the
<line: 8> indemnification claims. While this is certainly true, and the actions could easily proceed with the
<line: 9> adversary proceeding first and the pending state court action of Reff versus the Insurance Parties
<line: 10> proceeding only after Donahue has prevailed in the adversary proceeding, it will be much more
<line: 11> efficient for the bankruptcy and state courts involved, for the judicial process overall, and for
<line: 12> Reff and the Insurance Parties to resolve all matters in one action. Since this is the only court
<line: 13> that can have jurisdiction over all of the claims involved in the adversary proceeding and third-
<line: 14> party complaint and because the facts concerning the formation of the insurance contract and
<line: 15> issuance of the policy are common to both Donahue's claim, the defenses to that claim, and the
<line: 16> third-party claims of Reff, cause has been shown for withdrawal of the reference and the exercise
<line: 17> of supplemental jurisdiction over the third-party claims.

[TEXT]
<line: 19>  Judicial economy, convenience, and conservation of debtor and creditor resources all
<line: 20> counsel withdrawing the reference. While the adversary proceeding is a core proceeding, it.
<line: 21> involves state-law rather than bankruptcy issues. Uniformity of bankruptcy administration is not
<line: 22> implicated. Reff's desire to try all of the issues in one case looks more like a quest for efficiency
<line: 23> than forum shopping. Weighing the various factors set out above that courts have used to
<line: 24> determine whether cause has been shown to withdraw the reference, the court concludes cause
<line: 25> has been shown here.

[TEXT]
<line: 27> For the foregoing reasons, Reff Properties, LLC's motion to withdraw the reference [1] is
<line: 28> granted. The court has supplemental jurisdiction over the third-party claims. Parties to schedule.
