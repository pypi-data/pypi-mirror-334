[TEXT]
<line: 4> have been parties to one or more collective bargaining agreements (collectively, the “CBA”), 
<line: 5> that obligate Defendant to make monthly contributions to Plaintiffs for all employees covered by 
<line: 6> the CBA. 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> 13. 
<line: 9> In August 2010, Defendant and the MEBA entered into a memorandum of 
<line: 10> understanding (the “MOU”) which, inter alia, extended the term of Defendant’s CBA. 

[TEXT]
<line: 12> 14. 
<line: 13> Specifically, the MOU provided that Defendant’s CBA would “continue in full 
<line: 14> force and effect until midnight, September 30, 2011 and shall continue from year to year 
<line: 15> thereafter unless either the Company or the Union shall give written notice to the other of its 
<line: 16> desire to amend the agreement, which shall be given at least sixty (60) but no sooner than ninety 
<line: 17> (90) days, prior to the expiration date.  In the event either the Company or the Union serves 
<line: 18> notice to amend the Agreement, the terms of the Agreement in effect at that time of the notice to 
<line: 19> amend shall continue in effect until mutual agreement on the proposed amendments or an 
<line: 20> impasse has been reached.” 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 15. 
<line: 23> In other words, in order for Defendant’s CBA to terminate, thereby absolving 
<line: 24> Defendant of its ongoing obligation to pay contributions to Plaintiffs, the following requirements 
<line: 25> must have been met:  (a) between 60-90 days prior to September 30, 2011, or an anniversary 
<line: 26> thereafter, either Defendant and/or the MEBA was required to give notice of their desire to 
<line: 27> amend the CBA; and (b) Defendant and the MEBA were required to reach impasse on 
<line: 28> amendments to the CBA. 

[TEXT]
<line: 30> 16. 
<line: 31> Thus, even if Defendant and/or the MEBA desired to amend the CBA and gave 
<line: 32> timely notice to the other of that intention, the CBA would remain in effect past September 30, 
<line: 33> 2011, unless and until Defendant and the MEBA reached impasse on amending the CBA.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 17. 
<line: 5> In July 2011, both Defendant and the MEBA gave timely notice to the other of 
<line: 6> their desire to amend the CBA. 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> 18. 
<line: 9> Effective October 1, 2011, Defendant entered into a CBA with the American 
<line: 10> Maritime Officers, a different union than the MEBA, which, upon information and belief, did not 
<line: 11> require Defendant to make contributions to any of the Plaintiffs. 

[TEXT]
<line: 13> 19. 
<line: 14> Defendant ceased making contributions to Plaintiffs for any work performed 
<line: 15> within the scope of its CBA with the MEBA beginning October 1, 2011. 

[TEXT]
<line: 17> 20. 
<line: 18> The MEBA’s consistent position was that Defendant remained bound to its CBA 
<line: 19> with the MEBA because impasse had not been reached and, therefore, the CBA remained in 
<line: 20> effect past September 30, 2011. 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 21. 
<line: 23> Pursuant to the grievance procedures under the CBA, the MEBA filed grievances 
<line: 24> against Defendant, alleging, inter alia, that Defendant had breached the CBA by refusing to 
<line: 25> comply with the CBA until an agreement was reached on amendments to the CBA or until 
<line: 26> impasse was reached. 

[TEXT]
<line: 28> 22. 
<line: 29> Defendant’s CBA includes an arbitration provision which provides, inter alia, that 
<line: 30> “[a]ll disputes relating to the interpretation or performance of this Agreement shall be 
<line: 31> determined in accordance with” the binding arbitration procedures set forth in the CBA. 

[TEXT]
<line: 33> 23. 
<line: 34> The MEBA sought to follow the CBA’s arbitration provisions to resolve its 
<line: 35> grievances.  However, Defendant refused to follow those procedures. 

[TEXT]
<line: 37> 24. 
<line: 38> As a result, on October 11, 2011, the MEBA filed a lawsuit in the United States 
<line: 39> District Court for the District of Columbia (the “District Court”) due to Defendant’s refusal to 
<line: 40> arbitrate the MEBA’s grievances.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 25. 
<line: 5> In that lawsuit, Defendant, inter alia, took the position that the questions of 
<line: 6> whether impasse had been reached and whether the CBA thereby remained in effect were for the 
<line: 7> District Court to decide, rather than for an arbitrator. 

[TEXT]
<line: 9> 26. 
<line: 10> On September 30, 2014, the District Court rejected Defendant’s arguments and 
<line: 11> held, inter alia, that the questions of whether impasse had been reached and whether the CBA 
<line: 12> remained in effect were within the scope of the CBA’s arbitration provision.  Accordingly, the 
<line: 13> District Court compelled Defendant and the MEBA to arbitrate these issues pursuant to the 
<line: 14> CBA’s arbitration provisions.  Dist. No. 1, Pac. Coast Dist., Marine Eng’rs’ Beneficial Ass’n, 
<line: 15> AFL-CIO v. Liberty Mar. Corp., 70 F. Supp. 3d 327 (D.D.C. 2014). 

[TEXT]
<line: 17> 27. 
<line: 18> On February 26, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of 
<line: 19> Columbia Circuit (the “D.C. Circuit”) affirmed all aspects of the District Court’s decision.  Dist. 
<line: 20> No. 1, Pac. Coast Dist., Marine Eng’rs’ Beneficial Ass’n, AFL-CIO v. Liberty Mar. Corp., 815 
<line: 21> F.3d 834 (D.C. Cir. 2016). 

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 28. 
<line: 24> Defendant did not seek rehearing of that decision by the D.C. Circuit, nor did 
<line: 25> Defendant file a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States, and 
<line: 26> the time for Defendant to take either such action has expired.  Accordingly, that decision is now 
<line: 27> final and binding. 

[TEXT]
<line: 29> 29. 
<line: 30> As a result, to the extent it would otherwise attempt to do so, Defendant is 
<line: 31> collaterally estopped from disputing that the question of whether its CBA continued in effect past 
<line: 32> September 30, 2011, was properly subject to being decided by an arbitrator. 

[TEXT]
<line: 34> 30. 
<line: 35> After the District Court entered judgment in favor of the MEBA and compelled 
<line: 36> arbitration, Defendant moved the District Court to stay that order pending its appeal.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 31. 
<line: 5> On November 13, 2014, the District Court denied Defendant’s motion to stay the 
<line: 6> order compelling arbitration. 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> 32. 
<line: 9> Defendant did not move the D.C. Circuit to stay the District Court’s order 
<line: 10> pending appeal. 

[TEXT]
<line: 12> 33. 
<line: 13> Accordingly, while Defendant’s appeal to the D.C. Circuit was pending, 
<line: 14> Defendant and the MEBA arbitrated the MEBA’s grievances. 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> 34. 
<line: 17> An arbitration hearing was held on May 15, July 15, and July 16, 2015, in New 
<line: 18> York City. 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> 35. 
<line: 21> On December 2, 2015, the Arbitrator issued an award sustaining the MEBA’s 
<line: 22> grievances and finding, inter alia, that “[t]he parties were not at impasse as of September 30, 
<line: 23> 2011 and, therefore, the parties’ agreement remains in full force and effect retroactive to 
<line: 24> September 30, 2011.” 

[TEXT]
<line: 26> 36. 
<line: 27> The arbitration provision of Defendant’s CBA provides that “[t]he decision of . . . 
<line: 28> the Arbitrator . . . shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall be complied with by both 
<line: 29> parties immediately upon its issuance.” 

[TEXT]
<line: 31> 37. 
<line: 32> Accordingly, the Arbitrator’s decision that Defendant’s CBA has remained in full 
<line: 33> force and effect since September 30, 2011, is final and binding. 

[TEXT]
<line: 35> 38. 
<line: 36> As a result, to the extent it would otherwise attempt to do so, Defendant is 
<line: 37> collaterally estopped from disputing that its CBA, pursuant to which Defendant was required to 
<line: 38> pay contributions to Plaintiffs, has remained in full force and effect since September 30, 2011, 
<line: 39> and continues in effect at the current time. 

[TEXT]
<line: 41> 39. 
<line: 42> Despite the Arbitrator’s decision that Defendant’s CBA has remained in full force 
<line: 43> and effect since September 30, 2011, and continues in effect, and despite the fact that CBA

[TEXT]
<line: 4> required Defendant to pay contributions to Plaintiffs, Defendant has not paid any contributions to 
<line: 5> Plaintiffs for any work performed within the scope of that CBA from October 1, 2011, to the 
<line: 6> date of filing of this Complaint. 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> 40. 
<line: 9> Accordingly, Defendant owes contributions to Plaintiffs for all covered work 
<line: 10> performed under its CBA from September 30, 2011, forward. 

[TEXT]
<line: 12> 41. 
<line: 13> Upon information and belief, Defendant has vigorously disputed the amounts that 
<line: 14> the MEBA has claimed to be owed by Defendant as a result of the Arbitrator’s decision, 
<line: 15> including, inter alia, the contributions that are owed to Plaintiffs. 

[TEXT]
<line: 17> 42. 
<line: 18> As a result, although Plaintiffs have no obligation to have made a demand to 
<line: 19> Defendant prior to initiating this litigation, any such demand would have been futile as 
<line: 20> evidenced by the positions that Defendant has taken in the arbitration. 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 43. 
<line: 23> The exact amount of contributions owed by Defendant to Plaintiffs will be proved 
<line: 24> by Plaintiffs.  However, Plaintiffs have estimated that Defendant owes at least $23,288,344.44 in 
<line: 25> contributions to Plaintiffs for work performed within the scope of the CBA through July 31, 
<line: 26> 2017, consisting of the following: 

[TEXT]
<line: 28> a. 
<line: 29> $5,135,259.06 to the Pension Plan; 
<line: 30> b.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 44. 
<line: 5> The amount of delinquent contributions owed by Defendant is continuing to grow 
<line: 6> because, as of the date of filing of this Complaint, Defendant is still not making contributions to 
<line: 7> Plaintiffs as required by its CBA. 

[TEXT]
<line: 9> 45. 
<line: 10> Pursuant to ERISA §§ 502(g)(2) & (g)(2)(B), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1132(g)(2) & 
<line: 11> (g)(2)(B), in seeking to recover delinquent contributions, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover 
<line: 12> “interest on the unpaid contributions,” which “shall be determined by using the rate provided 
<line: 13> under the plan.” 

[TEXT]
<line: 15> 46. 
<line: 16> Under the Plans’ Delinquency Policy, contributions which are not timely paid are 
<line: 17> assessed interest at the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus 5% per year from the date that 
<line: 18> contributions were due, compounded monthly.   

[TEXT]
<line: 20> 47. 
<line: 21> Accordingly, all contributions at issue are subject to an interest rate of, at 
<line: 22> minimum, 8.25% per year, compounded monthly. 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> 48. 
<line: 25> The exact amount of interest owed by Defendant will be proved by Plaintiffs.  
<line: 26> However, based upon unpaid contributions of at least $23,288,344.44, Defendant is estimated to 
<line: 27> owe at least $6,722,245.47 in interest. 

[TEXT]
<line: 29> 49. 
<line: 30> The amount of interest owed by Defendant is continuing to grow both because of 
<line: 31> the ongoing accrual and compounding of interest and because, as of the date of filing of this 
<line: 32> Complaint, Defendant is still not making contributions to Plaintiffs. 

[TEXT]
<line: 34> 50. 
<line: 35> Pursuant to ERISA § 502(g)(2)(C), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(g)(2)(C), Plaintiffs are also 
<line: 36> entitled to recover “an amount equal to the greater of – (i) interest on the unpaid contributions, or 
<line: 37> (ii) liquidated damages provided for under the plan in an amount not in excess of 20 percent 
<line: 38> . . . .”

<line: 4> 51. 
<line: 5> In other words, while Plaintiffs are entitled to liquidated damages of up to 20% of 
<line: 6> the unpaid contributions, if the amount of interest that is owed is greater than the liquidated 
<line: 7> damages provided under the plan, then Plaintiffs are entitled to a second assessment of interest, 
<line: 8> or “double interest,” in lieu of liquidated damages. 

[TEXT]
<line: 10> 52. 
<line: 11> The Plans’ Delinquency Policy, likewise holds delinquent employers liable for the 
<line: 12> greater of (i) double interest; or (ii) liquidated damages at the maximum amount permitted under 
<line: 13> ERISA § 502(g)(2)(C), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(g)(2)(C), which, as noted above, is 20%. 

[TEXT]
<line: 15> 53. 
<line: 16> The exact amount of liquidated damages owed by Defendant will be proved by 
<line: 17> Plaintiffs.  However, as of the filing of this Complaint, Plaintiffs estimate that an award of 
<line: 18> double interest exceeds an award of liquidated damages.  Therefore, Plaintiffs are entitled to a 
<line: 19> second assessment of interest which, as noted above, is currently estimated to be at least 
<line: 20> $6,722,245.47. 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 54. 
<line: 23> The amount of double interest and/or liquidated damages owed by Defendant is
