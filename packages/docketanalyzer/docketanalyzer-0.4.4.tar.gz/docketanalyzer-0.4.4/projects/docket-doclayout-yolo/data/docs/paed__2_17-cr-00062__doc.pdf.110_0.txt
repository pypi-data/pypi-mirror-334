[TITLE]
<line: 17> MEMORANDUM 

[TEXT]
<line: 19>             After his pretrial motions were denied, defendant Raheem Pleasant pleaded guilty to four 
<line: 20> counts of bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a). He appealed the pretrial rulings to 
<line: 21> the Third Circuit but withdrew that appeal on February 14, 2019.1  He now brings this pro se 
<line: 22> motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255.  For several reasons, the motion fails. 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> First, it is untimely. The Circuit granted the motion to dismiss the appeal the same day it 
<line: 25> was filed.  ECF 104.  Mr. Pleasant did not (and could not) appeal his voluntary dismissal of his 
<line: 26> direct appeal, and as a result the judgment in this case  became final for Section 2255(f) purposes 
<line: 27> on May 15, 2019—that is, ninety days after the Third Circuit’s dismissal of his direct appeal. Mr. 
<line: 28> Pleasant therefore had until May 15, 2020, at the latest, to file a timely petition under Section 
<line: 29> 2255(f). United States v. Serrano, No. 05-067, 2008 WL 2780597, at *1 (E.D. Pa. July 15, 2008) 
<line: 30> (describing “strict and short” statute of limitations for Section 2255). He missed this deadline by 

[ABANDON]
<line: 32> 1 Third Circuit case 18-3821.  The Government has attached the relevant docket entry from the 
<line: 33> Court of Appeals to its response to the pending motion.  ECF 109, Exhibit A. The filing with the 
<line: 34> circuit includes Mr. Pleasant’s letter of instruction to counsel directing withdrawal of his appeal.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> just under two months, because the certificate of service Petitioner signed was dated July 3, 
<line: 5> 2020, the petition was postmarked July 7, 2020, and it was docketed July 9, 2020.  

[TEXT]
<line: 7> Mr. Pleasant invokes equitable tolling in an attempt to excuse his late filing, asserting that 
<line: 8> his attorney had died before he could put forth any substantive arguments on appeal.  That is 
<line: 9> belied by the record, as counsel, the late James Lammendola, indisputably filed a motion with 
<line: 10> the circuit on February 14, 2019 withdrawing the appeal, attaching the written instructions of his 
<line: 11> client, Mr. Pleasant.   I will further take judicial notice that Mr. Lammendola’s date of death was 
<line: 12> in fact February 18, 2019.  Mr. Pleasant raises no other ground to toll the time limitation, and I 
<line: 13> can see none.  

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Moreover, having voluntarily abandoned his direct appeal, the claims he raises here 
<line: 16> would be procedurally defaulted for purposes of Section 2255 even if his petition were timely. 
<line: 17> That is so because the general rule is that “claims not raised on direct appeal may not be raised 
<line: 18> on collateral review unless the petitioner shows cause and prejudice,”  Massaro v. United States, 
<line: 19> 538 U.S. 500, 504 (2003), neither of which can be said to exist where a defendant of his own 
<line: 20> volition  withdraws his direct appeal. See also United States v. Travillion, 759 F.3d 281, 288 n.11 
<line: 21> (3d Cir. 2014) (“[I]ssues which should have been raised on direct appeal may not be raised with 
<line: 22> a § 2255 motion.”). 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Finally, even if not both untimely and procedurally defaulted, the motion does no more 
<line: 25> than seek to revisit arguments thoroughly considered before Mr. Pleasant entered his plea. 
<line: 26> United States v. Pleasant, 17-0062, 2017 WL 5010370 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 1, 2017).  As recounted 
<line: 27> there in detail, Mr. Pleasant was identified  because of thorough  police work, and because the 
<line: 28> surveillance video was sufficiently clear so that his probation officer, a cousin he enlisted to 
<line: 29> move incriminating evidence, and the mother of his child could all identify him as the robber.  Id

[TEXT]
<line: 4> at *5. I have already considered, and rejected, Mr. Pleasant’s argument that he was wrongfully 
<line: 5> arrested, and his car was wrongfully seized. Id. at *2.  He cites no new evidence or any change in 
<line: 6> the law since then. 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> The motion will be denied, without a certificate of appealability.  An appropriate order 
<line: 9> follows.
