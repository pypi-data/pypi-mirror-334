[TITLE]
<line: 17> MEMORANDUM  

[TEXT]
<line: 19> Raheem Pleasant pleaded guilty to participating in four bank robberies, for which he 
<line: 20> received a Guideline sentence of 160 months.  He has served approximately 73 months of that 
<line: 21> sentence, and now moves for compassionate release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. section 3582 
<line: 22> (c)(1)(A)(i). For the reasons that follow, the motion will be denied. 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Mr. Pleasant asserts the need to care for his grandmother as the basis for his motion. As an 
<line: 25> initial matter, I note that the Third Circuit has endorsed the Sentencing Commission’s policy 
<line: 26> statement regarding compassionate release as an appropriate source for courts to consider.  
<line: 27> United States v. Andrews, 12 F.4th 255, 260 (3d Cir. 2021). That statement suggests that qualifying 
<line: 28> family circumstances should be limited to situations where the defendant is the only available 
<line: 29> caregiver for a spouse or for minor children. U.S.S.G. § 1B1.13 app. note 1(C).  The Commission’s 
<line: 30> policy statement is neither controlling nor dispositive, and I can conceive of circumstances 
<line: 31> involving a grandparent that might qualify.  But it bears some weight as Mr. Pleasant does not 
<line: 32> point to any case where release to care for a grandparent has been granted, nor has the Court’s 
<line: 33> research revealed any.  And the Government accurately cites numerous cases to the contrary. E.g., 
<line: 34> United States v. Goldberg, 2020 WL 1853298, at *4 (D.D.C. Apr. 13, 2020); United States v. 
<line: 35> Ingram, 2019 WL 3162305 (S.D. Ohio July 16, 2019); United States v. Henry, 2020 WL 3791849,

<line: 4> at *4 (E.D.N.Y. July 6, 2020); United States v. Thorpe, 2019 WL 6119214 (C.D. Ill. Nov. 18, 
<line: 5> 2019).   

[TEXT]
<line: 7> More importantly, Mr. Pleasant has not provided any details about his grandmother’s 
<line: 8> condition or her current needs for care, nor how it is he would propose to care for her.  
<line: 9> Neither does he demonstrate that he is the only available caregiver for her.  Courts routinely require 
<line: 10> such a showing where care for others forms the basis for a compassionate release motion. See 
<line: 11> United States v. Rooks, 2022 WL 267899, at *6 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 28, 2022); United States v. 
<line: 12> Ellsworth-Daway, 2021 WL 2823081, at *2-3 (E.D. Pa. July 7,2021); United States v. Cruz-
<line: 13> Rivera, 2020 WL 5993352, at *7 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 9,2020).  

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Separately, I must also consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. §3553(a).   The bank 
<line: 16> robberies in which Mr. Pleasant participated are crimes giving rise to great concern. That concern 
<line: 17> is magnified by his criminal record which includes his having committed the first robbery in this 
<line: 18> case when he was in a halfway house while on parole from an earlier robbery charge. It appears 
<line: 19> that Mr. Pleasant has committed himself to rehabilitation, and for that he is to be commended.  
<line: 20> But, aside from him failing to establish “extraordinary and compelling” circumstances, early 
<line: 21> release would undermine the need to promote respect for the rule of law, and the need to deter him 
<line: 22> from future crimes.

<line: 24> An appropriate order will follow.
