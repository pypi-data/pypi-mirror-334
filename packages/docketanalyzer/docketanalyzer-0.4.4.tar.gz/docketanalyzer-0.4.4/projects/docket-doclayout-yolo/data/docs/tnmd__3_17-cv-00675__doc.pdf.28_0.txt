<line: 26> Pending before the Court is Plaintiffs’ motion to continue (Docket No. 27), which is 
<line: 27> CONDITIONALLY GRANTED as provided herein.  Plaintiffs and their counsel are hereby put 
<line: 28> on notice that any failure of their counsel to comply with the provisions of this Order will result in 
<line: 29> a recommendation to the District Judge for dismissal of this case with prejudice. 

[TEXT]
<line: 31> The events leading up to Plaintiffs’ motion are important to the entire picture of the 
<line: 32> accommodations extended to Plaintiffs’ counsel and the judicial resources expended in 
<line: 33> management of this case, which has now been pending more than a year.  Docket No. 1 (complaint 
<line: 34> filed on April 4, 2017).  An initial case management conference was originally set for June 5, 2017.  
<line: 35> However, by June 2, Plaintiff had filed a return of service for only one defendant, Jean Perez, and 
<line: 36> no proposed initial case management order had been submitted.  The initial case management 
<line: 37> conference was therefore continued to July 31, 2017, by order entered on June 2, 2017.  See Docket 
<line: 38> No. 9.   On the morning of July 31, the undersigned’s chambers were notified that Plaintiffs’ 
<line: 39> attorney would be unable to attend the initial case management conference due to illness.  See 
<line: 40> Docket No. 10.   Because no other returns of service were filed during the interim between June 2 
<line: 41> and July 31, 2017, Plaintiffs were also notified that unless by August 14, 2017, returns of service

<line: 2> were filed for all Defendants other than Jean Perez showing that service was effected within the 
<line: 3> time allowed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m), a recommendation would be made to the District Judge for 
<line: 4> dismissal of Plaintiffs’ claim against all other Defendants.  Id.  No such returns of service were 
<line: 5> filed, and on August 17, 2017, a report and recommendation was made for dismissal of all 
<line: 6> Defendants other than Jean Perez.  Docket No. 11.  No response to the report and recommendation 
<line: 7> was filed, and by order entered on September 7, 2017 (Docket No. 12), all other Defendants were 
<line: 8> dismissed. 

[TEXT]
<line: 10> On September 15, 2017, an order was entered directing Defendant Perez to answer by 
<line: 11> October 2, 2017, and resetting the initial case management conference for October 30, 2017.  
<line: 12> Docket No. 13.  Plaintiffs’ attorney failed to appear on that date, and no appearance was made on 
<line: 13> behalf of Defendant Perez.  See Order to Show Cause at Docket No. 16.  An order to show cause 
<line: 14> was issued on October 31, 2017, ordering Plaintiffs to show cause on or before November 14, 
<line: 15> 2017, why a recommendation should not be made to the District Judge for dismissal of this case 
<line: 16> for failure to prosecute and failure to obey the Court’s orders.  Id. 

[TEXT]
<line: 18> No response to the show cause order was filed, and on November 27, 2017, a 
<line: 19> recommendation of dismissal was made to the District Judge.  Docket No. 17.  On December 11, 
<line: 20> 2017, Plaintiffs objected to the report and recommendation of dismissal, on grounds that their 
<line: 21> attorney was experiencing difficulties with his CM/ECF electronic notifications and was also 
<line: 22> overwhelmed with other cases.  Docket No. 18.  Plaintiffs’ objections were sustained by order 
<line: 23> entered on December 15, 2017, and the report and recommendation was set aside, but Plaintiffs 
<line: 24> were put on notice that the Court would not tolerate any further lapses in judgment by Plaintiffs’ 
<line: 25> counsel.  Docket No. 19.

[TEXT]
<line: 2> By order entered on December 18, 2017, the initial case management conference was again 
<line: 3> reset on January 22, 2018.  Docket No. 20.  On January 17, 2018, Plaintiffs’ counsel moved to 
<line: 4> continue this setting due to a conflicting immigration asylum hearing on January 22.  Docket 
<line: 5> No. 22.  The initial case management was yet again rescheduled, this time for February 7, 2018.  
<line: 6> Docket No. 23.   

[TEXT]
<line: 8> On February 6, 2018, Plaintiffs’ counsel moved for default judgment (even though no 
<line: 9> default had yet been entered).  Docket No. 24.  At the initial case management conference held on 
<line: 10> February 7, at which Plaintiffs’ counsel appeared, the Court discussed with Plaintiffs’ counsel the 
<line: 11> obvious defects in the motion for default judgment, including the lack of a proper affidavit of 
<line: 12> service, lack of certification of Defendant Perez’s military status, and lack of evidence of 
<line: 13> computable sum certain damages.  See Docket No. 25.  To allow Plaintiffs’ attorney additional 
<line: 14> time to address these deficiencies, the initial case management conference was reset (yet again) 
<line: 15> for April 19, 2018, and Plaintiffs were expressly cautioned to “promptly proceed with whatever 
<line: 16> default relief they seek in this case, and should not wait until days before the rescheduled case 
<line: 17> management conference before taking action to bring this case to a conclusion.”  Id. at 25. 

[TEXT]
<line: 19> By order entered on February 9, 2018 (Docket No. 26), the Clerk denied Plaintiffs’ motion for 
<line: 20> default judgment for the same reasons discussed with Plaintiffs’ counsel during the February 7 initial 
<line: 21> case management conference and recited in the Court’s February 8 order.  The Clerk’s order also 
<line: 22> described for Plaintiffs’ benefit, and that of their counsel, the exact steps that needed to be taken prior 
<line: 23> to filing any motion for entry of default.   

[TEXT]
<line: 25> However, no other action was taken by Plaintiffs during the interim between February 8 and 
<line: 26> April 19, 2018, the date of the rescheduled initial case management conference.   No appearance was 
<line: 27> made by Plaintiffs’ counsel at the scheduled time of 11:00 a.m. on April 19 for the initial case 
<line: 28> management conference.  Instead, according to the CM/ECF docket transaction for Docket Entry

[TEXT]
<line: 2> No. 27, at 11:25 p.m. on April 19, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a motion to continue (Docket No. 27), 
<line: 3> reciting that he was again ill, and again overwhelmed by other client commitments. 

[TEXT]
<line: 5> The Court finds that Plaintiffs’ attorney has failed to comply with multiple court orders and 
<line: 6> failed to appear for multiple scheduling conferences, from each of which, and certainly from all of 
<line: 7> which together, the imposition of sanctions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f)(1) is warranted.  While the 
<line: 8> undersigned appreciates the challenges facing small office practitioners, and is mindful of the interests 
<line: 9> of justice for Plaintiffs, at this point, the amount of attention given to this case by the Court appears to 
<line: 10> far outweigh that given by Plaintiffs’ counsel.  Accordingly, the Court orders the following: 

[TEXT]
<line: 12> 1. 
<line: 13> By no later than May 4, 2018, Plaintiffs shall file an appropriate motion under Rule 55.  
<line: 14> Plaintiffs’ counsel should carefully prepare the necessary filings, because no further defects or 
<line: 15> deficiencies will be tolerated.  Failure to file a timely and fully compliant Rule 55 motion for 
<line: 16> default will result in recommendation for dismissal of this case.   If default is entered by the Clerk, 
<line: 17> Plaintiffs shall thereafter timely and fully comply with further orders of either the Clerk or the Court 
<line: 18> for entry of judgment.  Failure to timely and fully comply with further orders necessary for any 
<line: 19> requested default judgment will result in recommendation for dismissal of this case.    

[TEXT]
<line: 21> 2. 
<line: 22> Plaintiffs’ counsel shall complete a minimum one-hour accredited law practice 
<line: 23> management continuing legal education course, which specifically includes a component of time 
<line: 24> management, and provide certification of completion by no later than July 6, 2018.  Failure by 
<line: 25> Plaintiffs’ counsel to timely file certification of the completed course will result in 
<line: 26> recommendation for dismissal of this case.   

[TEXT]
<line: 28> 3. 
<line: 29> To allow Plaintiffs ample time to properly pursue default relief, and for Plaintiffs’ 
<line: 30> counsel to demonstrate compliance with this Order, the initial case management conference is 
<line: 31> RESCHEDULED for Thursday, July 12, 2018, at 10:00 a.m., in Courtroom 764, 801 Broadway, 
<line: 32> Nashville, Tennessee.  No other motions to continue will be granted.  Failure by Plaintiffs’ counsel

<line: 7> later than May 4, 2018, file a certificate of service, certifying such service under penalty of perjury.
<line: 8> Failure by Plaintiffs' counsel to properly serve this Order or to timely file a proper certificate of
<line: 9> service will result in recommendation for dismissal of this case.
