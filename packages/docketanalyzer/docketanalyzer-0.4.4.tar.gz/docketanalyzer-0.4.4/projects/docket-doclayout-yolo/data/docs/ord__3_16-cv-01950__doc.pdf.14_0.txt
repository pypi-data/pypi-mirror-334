<line: 28> Michael H. Simon, District Judge. 

[TEXT]
<line: 30> Joel Guembes (“Plaintiff”) seeks judicial review of the final decision of the 
<line: 31> Commissioner of the Social Security Administration (“Commissioner”) denying his application 
<line: 32> for Supplemental Security Income (“SSI”) pursuant to the Social Security Act. Because the 
<line: 33> Commissioner’s decision is not based on the proper legal standards and the findings are not

<line: 35> PAGE 1 – OPINION AND ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> supported by substantial evidence, the decision is REVERSED and REMANDED for further 
<line: 3> proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

[TITLE]
<line: 5> STANDARD OF REVIEW 

[TEXT]
<line: 7> The district court must affirm the Commissioner’s decision if it is based on the proper 
<line: 8> legal standards and the findings are supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. § 405(g); see 
<line: 9> also Hammock v. Bowen, 879 F.2d 498, 501 (9th Cir. 1989). “Substantial evidence” means 
<line: 10> “more than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance.” Bray v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec. 
<line: 11> Admin., 554 F.3d 1219, 1222 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Andrews v. Shalala, 53 F.3d 1035, 1039 
<line: 12> (9th Cir. 1995)). It means “such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate 
<line: 13> to support a conclusion.” Id. (quoting Andrews, 53 F.3d at 1039). 

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Where the evidence is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation, the 
<line: 16> Commissioner’s conclusion must be upheld. Burch v. Barnhart, 400 F.3d 676, 679 (9th 
<line: 17> Cir. 2005). Variable interpretations of the evidence are insignificant if the Commissioner’s 
<line: 18> interpretation is a rational reading of the record, and this Court may not substitute its judgment 
<line: 19> for that of the Commissioner. See Batson v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec. Admin., 359 F.3d 1190, 1193, 
<line: 20> 1196 (9th Cir. 2004). “[A] reviewing court must consider the entire record as a whole and may 
<line: 21> not affirm simply by isolating a specific quantum of supporting evidence.” Orn v. Astrue, 495 
<line: 22> F.3d 625, 630 (9th Cir. 2007) (quoting Robbins v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 466 F.3d 880, 882 (9th 
<line: 23> Cir. 2006) (quotation marks omitted)). A reviewing court, however, may not affirm the 
<line: 24> Commissioner on a ground upon which the Commissioner did not rely. Id.; see also Bray, 554 
<line: 25> F.3d at 1226.

[TITLE]
<line: 2> BACKGROUND 

[TITLE]
<line: 4> A. Plaintiff’s Application 

[TEXT]
<line: 6> Plaintiff filed his application for SSI that is the subject of this case on November 3, 2011, 
<line: 7> alleging disability beginning on April 1, 2006. AR 318. Born October 4, 1989, Plaintiff was 16 
<line: 8> years old when he suffered a traumatic brain injury in an automobile accident, and 22 years old 
<line: 9> on his alleged disability onset date. AR 426, 137. Plaintiff alleges “short and long term memory 
<line: 10> defects, difficulty learning new material, poor impulse control, poor concentration, impaired 
<line: 11> balance, and depression.” AR 393. The Commissioner denied Plaintiff’s application initially on 
<line: 12> January 30, 2012, and on reconsideration on May 15, 2012. AR 146, 158.  

[TEXT]
<line: 14> PAGE 3 – OPINION AND ORDER 
<line: 15> On May 25, 2012, Plaintiff requested a hearing to review the denial of SSI. AR 200. 
<line: 16> Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) Paul G. Robeck presided over a hearing on June 13, 2013. 
<line: 17> AR 208. The ALJ issued a decision finding that Plaintiff was not disabled on June 24, 2013. 
<line: 18> AR 160. The ALJ found Plaintiff had severe impairments of cognitive disorder, mood disorder 
<line: 19> and polysubstance dependence. AR 165. The ALJ found Plaintiff was limited to jobs requiring 
<line: 20> reasoning level of one and noise level of two, could not perform work requiring balancing, 
<line: 21> working at heights, or climbing ladders, ropes, and scaffolds, and that Plaintiff should avoid 
<line: 22> concentrated exposure to hazards. AR 167. Plaintiff requested a review of the ALJ’s decision by 
<line: 23> the Appeals Council on July 2, 2013. AR 268. The Appeals Council vacated and remanded the 
<line: 24> ALJ’s decision on November 7, 2013, after finding several of the jobs the ALJ had identified 
<line: 25> exceeded Plaintiff’s residual function capacity (“RFC”) because they required a reasoning level 
<line: 26> of two. AR 184. The Appeals Council directed the ALJ to consider new evidence; evaluate 
<line: 27> Plaintiff’s impairments with the techniques described in 20 CFR § 416.920(a); evaluate 
<line: 28> Plaintiff’s RFC by providing appropriate rationale and specific reference to evidence in the 
<line: 29> record; obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational expert (“VE”) to clarify the effect of 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Plaintiff’s limitations; and identify appropriate jobs for Plaintiff and state the incidence of such 
<line: 3> jobs in the national economy. AR 185.  

[TEXT]
<line: 5> A second hearing was held in front of ALJ Robeck on August 11, 2015. AR 298. On 
<line: 6> October 9, 2015, the ALJ issued his second decision, and again found Plaintiff not disabled. 
<line: 7> AR 14. The ALJ made findings consistent with his first findings regarding Plaintiff’s severe 
<line: 8> impairments, inability to perform certain tasks, and an RFC limiting Plaintiff to a reasoning level 
<line: 9> of one; however, this time the ALJ found that Plaintiff was limited to a noise level of three. 
<line: 10> AR 19-23. Plaintiff requested that the Appeals Council review the ALJ’s second decision. 
<line: 11> AR 10. The Appeals Council, finding no reason under their rules to review the ALJ’s decision, 
<line: 12> denied Plaintiff’s request for review on August 31, 2016, and the ALJ’s decision became the 
<line: 13> final decision of the Commissioner. AR 1. Plaintiff seeks review of that decision. 

[TITLE]
<line: 15> B. The Sequential Analysis 

[TEXT]
<line: 17> A claimant is disabled if he or she is unable to “engage in any substantial gainful activity 
<line: 18> by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which . . . has lasted or 
<line: 19> can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months[.]” 42 U.S.C. 
<line: 20> § 423(d)(1)(A). “Social Security Regulations set out a five-step sequential process for 
<line: 21> determining whether an applicant is disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act.” 
<line: 22> Keyser v. Comm’r Soc. Sec. Admin., 648 F.3d 721, 724 (9th Cir. 2011); see also 20 C.F.R. 
<line: 23> §§ 404.1520 (DIB), 416.920 (SSI); Bowen v. Yuckert, 482 U.S. 137, 140 (1987). Each step is 
<line: 24> potentially dispositive. 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(a)(4), 416.920(a)(4). The five-step sequential 
<line: 25> process asks the following series of questions: 

[TEXT]
<line: 27> 1. 
<line: 28> Is the claimant performing “substantial gainful activity?” 20 C.F.R. 
<line: 29> §§ 404.1520(a)(4)(i), 416.920(a)(4)(i). This activity is work involving 
<line: 30> significant mental or physical duties done or intended to be done for pay 
<line: 31> or profit. 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1510, 416.910. If the claimant is performing 
<line: 32> such work, she is not disabled within the meaning of the Act. 20 C.F.R. 

[TITLE]
<line: 34> PAGE 4 – OPINION AND ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> §§ 404.1520(a)(4)(i), 416.920(a)(4)(i). If the claimant is not performing 
<line: 3> substantial gainful activity, the analysis proceeds to step two. 

[TEXT]
<line: 5> 2. 
<line: 6> Is the claimant’s impairment “severe” under the Commissioner’s 
<line: 7> regulations? 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(a)(4)(ii), 416.920(a)(4)(ii). An 
<line: 8> impairment or combination of impairments is “severe” if it significantly 
<line: 9> limits the claimant’s physical or mental ability to do basic work activities. 
<line: 10> 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1521(a), 416.921(a). Unless expected to result in death, 
<line: 11> this impairment must have lasted or be expected to last for a continuous 
<line: 12> period of at least 12 months. 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1509, 416.909. If the 
<line: 13> claimant does not have a severe impairment, the analysis ends. 20 C.F.R. 
<line: 14> §§ 404.1520(a)(4)(ii), 416.920(a)(4)(ii). If the claimant has a severe 
<line: 15> impairment, the analysis proceeds to step three. 

[TEXT]
<line: 17> 3. 
<line: 18> Does the claimant’s severe impairment “meet or equal” one or more of the 
<line: 19> impairments listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1? If so, 
<line: 20> then the claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(a)(4)(iii), 
<line: 21> 416.920(a)(4)(iii). If the impairment does not meet or equal one or more of 
<line: 22> the listed impairments, the analysis continues. At that point, the ALJ must 
<line: 23> evaluate medical and other relevant evidence to assess and determine the 
<line: 24> claimant’s “residual functional capacity.” This is an assessment of work-
<line: 25> related activities that the claimant may still perform on a regular and 
<line: 26> continuing basis, despite any limitations imposed by his or her 
<line: 27> impairments. 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(e), 404.1545(b)-(c), 416.920(e), 
<line: 28> 416.945(b)-(c). After the ALJ determines the claimant’s RFC, the analysis 
<line: 29> proceeds to step four. 

[TEXT]
<line: 31> 4. 
<line: 32> Can the claimant perform his or her “past relevant work” with this RFC 
<line: 33> assessment? If so, then the claimant is not disabled. 20 C.F.R. 
<line: 34> §§ 404.1520(a)(4)(iv), 416.920(a)(4)(iv). If the claimant cannot perform 
<line: 35> his or her past relevant work, the analysis proceeds to step five. 

[TEXT]
<line: 37> 5. 
<line: 38> Considering the claimant’s RFC and age, education, and work experience, 
<line: 39> is the claimant able to make an adjustment to other work that exists in 
<line: 40> significant numbers in the national economy? If so, then the claimant is 
<line: 41> not disabled. 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(a)(4)(v), 416.920(a)(4)(v), 
<line: 42> 404.1560(c), 416.960(c). If the claimant cannot perform such work, he or 
<line: 43> she is disabled. Id.

<line: 47> PAGE 5 – OPINION AND ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> The claimant bears the burden of proof at steps one through four. Id. at 953; see also 
<line: 3> Tackett v. Apfel, 180 F.3d 1094, 1098 (9th Cir. 1999); Yuckert, 482 U.S. at 140-41. The 
<line: 4> Commissioner bears the burden of proof at step five. Tackett, 180 F.3d at 1100. At step five, the 
<line: 5> Commissioner must show that the claimant can perform other work that exists in significant 
<line: 6> numbers in the national economy, “taking into consideration the claimant’s residual functional 
<line: 7> capacity, age, education, and work experience.” Id.; see also 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1566, 416.966 
<line: 8> (describing “work which exists in the national economy”). If the Commissioner fails to meet this 
<line: 9> burden, the claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(a)(4)(v), 416.920(a)(4)(v). If, however, 
<line: 10> the Commissioner proves that the claimant is able to perform other work existing in significant 
<line: 11> numbers in the national economy, the claimant is not disabled. Bustamante, 262 F.3d at 953-54; 
<line: 12> Tackett, 180 F.3d at 1099. 

[TITLE]
<line: 14> C. The ALJ’s Decision 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> The ALJ applied the sequential analysis described above. At step one, the ALJ found that 
<line: 17> Plaintiff had not engaged in any substantial gainful activity after the application date of 
<line: 18> November 3, 2011. AR 19. At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff had the severe impairments 
<line: 19> of cognitive disorder, mood disorder, and alcohol and polysubstance dependence in reported 
<line: 20> remission. AR 20. At step three, the ALJ concluded that Plaintiff’s impairments did not meet the 
<line: 21> criteria of any listed impairment singularly or in combination under 20 CFR §§ 416.920(d), 
<line: 22> 416.925 or 416.926. AR 20. The ALJ found that the Plaintiff had mild restriction in activities of 
<line: 23> daily living, moderate difficulties in social functioning, moderate difficulties in concentration, 
<line: 24> persistence, or pace, and no episodes of decompensation for an extended duration. AR 21-22. 

[TEXT]
<line: 26> PAGE 6 – OPINION AND ORDER 
<line: 27> The ALJ determined that Plaintiff has the RFC to perform medium work limited to 
<line: 28> occasional public contact; without working as part of a team; without climbing ladders, ropes, or 
<line: 29> scaffolds; without working at heights; and with avoiding concentrated exposure to hazards. 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> AR 23. The RFC further stated that Plaintiff is limited to jobs with a noise level of three and a 
<line: 3> reasoning level of one. AR 23. At step four, the ALJ found that Plaintiff had no past relevant 
<line: 4> work. AR 43. At step five, the ALJ found Plaintiff capable of performing jobs that exist in 
<line: 5> significant numbers in the national economy based on Plaintiff’s age, education, work 
<line: 6> experience, and RFC. AR 43. Based on the VE’s testimony, the ALJ identified jobs listed in the 
<line: 7> Dictionary of Occupational Titles (“DOT”), including motel housekeeper, advertising material 
<line: 8> distributer, and window cleaner, as jobs suited to Plaintiff’s criteria. AR 44. As a result of the 
<line: 9> five-step analysis, the ALJ found Plaintiff “not disabled” from the filing date of Plaintiff’s 
<line: 10> application to the date of the hearing, and rejected Plaintiff’s application for SSI. AR 44. 

[TITLE]
<line: 12> DISCUSSION 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> Plaintiff argues that the ALJ erred by: (A) failing to incorporate all the limitations 
<line: 15> assigned by Dr. Ronald Sandoval, PhD into the RFC findings and dispositive hypothetical 
<line: 16> question after assigning his opinion “great weight”; (B) failing to provide sufficient reasoning by 
<line: 17> stating how a noise level three environment is appropriate given the medical evidence and 
<line: 18> Plaintiff’s problems with distraction to enable the Court to conduct a meaningful review; and 
<line: 19> (C) failing to incorporate the State Agency psychologists’ opinions that Plaintiff would benefit 
<line: 20> from vocational rehabilitation into the RFC and dispositive hypothetical question. The Court 
<line: 21> addresses each assignment of error in turn.  

[TITLE]
<line: 23> A. Limitations Identified by Dr. Sandoval  

[TEXT]
<line: 25> PAGE 7 – OPINION AND ORDER 
<line: 26> Plaintiff argues that the ALJ erred by failing to incorporate all the limitations identified 
<line: 27> by Dr. Sandoval into Plaintiff’s RFC and the hypothetical question posed to the VE after the ALJ 
<line: 28> gave the doctor’s opinion “great weight.” An ALJ must make fairly detailed finding in support of 
<line: 29> the administrative decision to permit a court to review those decisions intelligently but need not 
<line: 30> discuss all evidence presented. Vincent v. Heckler, 739 F.2d 1393, 1395 (9th Cir 1984). The ALJ 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> must explain why significant probative evidence was rejected; however, failure to discuss non-
<line: 3> significant or non-probative evidence does not require reversal. Id. When an ALJ’s hypothetical 
<line: 4> question to a VE fails accurately to reflect a claimant’s physical limitations, the ALJ may not 
<line: 5> rely on the VE’s opinion in denying benefits. Embrey v. Bowen, 849 F.2d 418, 422-423 (9th Cir. 
<line: 6> 1988).  

[TEXT]
<line: 8> The ALJ acknowledged Dr. Sandoval’s opinion within the section discussing Plaintiff’s 
<line: 9> RFC. AR 37. Dr. Sandoval opined that Plaintiff needs (1) communications, whether written or 
<line: 10> auditory, to be constructed in brief pieces of information, (2) instructions to be repeated, and 
<line: 11> (3) assignments to be broken down into smaller manageable components. AR 574. The ALJ 
<line: 12> specifically referenced these statements, gave Dr. Sandoval’s opinion “great weight,” and found 
<line: 13> that “[a]ccordingly, the residual functional capacity limits the claimant to jobs with a reasoning 
<line: 14> level of one and a noise level of three.” AR 37. The DOT defines reasoning level one as the 
<line: 15> ability of to “[a]pply commonsense understanding to carry out simple one- or two-step 
<line: 16> instructions” and “[d]eal with standardized situations with occasional or no variables in or from 
<line: 17> these situations encountered on the job.” See DOT App’x C (1991), available at 1991 
<line: 18> WL 688702. Noise level three involves no more than a moderate level of noise, with 
<line: 19> environments comparable to a “business office where type-writers are used; department store; 
<line: 20> grocery store; light traffic; fast food restaurant at off-hours.” See U.S. Dep’t of Labor, Selected 
<line: 21> Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Revised Dictionary of Occupational Titles 
<line: 22> (“SCO”), App’x D (1993).  

[TEXT]
<line: 24> The Commissioner argues that the RFC accounted for and was consistent with the 
<line: 25> limitations identified by Dr. Sandoval. An ALJ is not required to provide reasons to discount an 
<line: 26> opinion where the ALJ does not reject the conclusions but rather incorporates them into an RFC 

[ABANDON]
<line: 28> PAGE 8 – OPINION AND ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> assessment that is consistent with the opinion. Turner v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., 613 F.3d 1217, 
<line: 3> 1222-23 (9th Cir. 2010). An ALJ is responsible for “translating and incorporating clinical 
<line: 4> findings into a succinct RFC.” Rounds v. Comm’r Soc. Sec. Admin, 807 F.3d 996, 1006 (9th 
<line: 5> Cir. 2015) (citing Stubbs-Danielson v. Astrue, 539 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir. 2008)). The issue is 
<line: 6> whether the RFC did or did not incorporate the limitations identified by Dr. Sandoval.  

[TEXT]
<line: 8> The Court finds that the RFC sufficiently incorporates the limitations identified by 
<line: 9> Dr. Sandoval. The Ninth Circuit opinion in Rounds is persuasive authority for this conclusion. In 
<line: 10> Rounds, a doctor opined that the plaintiff should request that instructions be repeated and 
<line: 11> provided both verbally and in writing, and plaintiff should be limited in customer and public 
<line: 12> contact. Rounds, 807 F.3d at 1005. The Ninth Circuit held that an RFC that limited the plaintiff 
<line: 13> to “one to two step tasks with no public contact, no teamwork and limited coworker contact” 
<line: 14> adequately incorporated the opinions of the doctor. Id. at 1006.  

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Similar to Rounds, here the ALJ adequately incorporated Dr. Sandoval’s opinion that 
<line: 17> Plaintiff needs instructions repeated by limiting Plaintiff to reasoning level one work. Reasoning 
<line: 18> level one requires a person to “[a]pply commonsense understanding to carry out simple one- or 
<line: 19> two-step instructions.” DOT App’x C (emphasis added). The one- or two-step instruction 
<line: 20> limitation of reasoning level one is essentially the same limitation as in the RFC in Rounds, 
<line: 21> which the Ninth Circuit held adequately incorporated the need to have instructions repeated. 
<line: 22> Thus, Dr. Sandoval’s limitation that instructions be repeated was adequately incorporated into 
<line: 23> Plaintiff’s RFC. 

[TEXT]
<line: 25> Furthermore, the ALJ incorporated the other two limitations identified by Dr. Sandoval. 
<line: 26> It is a rational reading of the evidence that a one- or two-step instruction necessarily entails 
<line: 27> delivering the instruction in a brief piece of information and a smaller manageable component. 

[TITLE]
<line: 29> PAGE 9 – OPINION AND ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Where the ALJ’s interpretation is a rational reading of the record, even if there is more than one 
<line: 3> rational interpretation, the ALJ’s interpretation must be upheld. Burch, 400 F.3d at 679; 
<line: 4> Batson, 359 F.3d at 1193. Therefore, the ALJ’s RFC adequately incorporated all of 
<line: 5> Dr. Sandoval’s limitations.  

[TITLE]
<line: 7> B. Limitation of Noise Level Three 

[TEXT]
<line: 9> Plaintiff argues that the ALJ did not adequately account for Plaintiff’s problem with 
<line: 10> distraction into the RFC or provide a clear statement of the agency’s reasoning for setting 
<line: 11> Plaintiff’s limitation at noise level three that would “allow[] for meaningful review” by the 
<line: 12> Court. See Brown-Hunter v. Colvin, 806 F.3d 487, 492 (9th Cir. 2015).1 The ALJ must set forth 
<line: 13> reasons for denying disability insurance benefits in a way that allows for meaningful review. Id. 
<line: 14> A clear statement for the reasoning is necessary because a court can only affirm the agency’s 
<line: 15> decision to deny benefits on grounds invoked by the agency. Id. (citing Stout v. Comm’r, Soc. 
<line: 16> Sec. Admin., 454 F.3d 1050, 1054 (9th Cir. 2006)). Meaningful review requires access to the 
<line: 17> facts and reasoning supporting a decision. Bray, 554 F.3d at 1226. Where evidence is susceptible 
<line: 18> to more than one rational interpretation, the ALJ’s conclusion must be upheld. Burch, 400 F.3d 
<line: 19> at 679.  

[TEXT]
<line: 21> The RFC is the maximum a claimant can do despite his or her limitations. See 20 C.F.R. 
<line: 22> §§ 404.1545, 416.945. In determining the RFC, the ALJ must consider limitations imposed by all 
<line: 23> of a claimant’s impairments, even those that are not severe, and evaluate all of the relevant 
<line: 24> medical and other evidence, including the claimant’s testimony. See Social Security Ruling 

[ABANDON]
<line: 26> 1 Plaintiff states that the ALJ did not create a “logical bridge” between the medical 
<line: 27> evidence and setting Plaintiff’s limitation at noise level three. The “logical bridge” test derives 
<line: 28> from a Seventh Circuit opinion, but Plaintiff does not cite any Ninth Circuit opinion that has 
<line: 29> adopted such test. Therefore, the Court analyzes whether the ALJ’s decision allows for

<line: 3> the medical testimony and translating the claimant’s impairments into concrete functional 
<line: 4> limitations in the RFC. Stubbs-Danielson, 539 F.3d at 1174. All limitations supported by 
<line: 5> substantial evidence must be incorporated into the RFC and, by extension, the dispositive 
<line: 6> hypothetical question posed to the VE. Osenbrock v. Apfel, 240 F.3d 1157, 1163-65 (9th

<line: 9> The SCO is the companion manual to the DOT and provides examples of workplaces that 
<line: 10> involve different levels of noise. See SCO App’x D. Workplaces at noise level three have 
<line: 11> moderate noise and include business offices where typewriters are used, department stores, 
<line: 12> grocery stores, light traffic, and fast food restaurants at off hours. Id. Workplaces at noise level 
<line: 13> two have quiet noise and include libraries, many private offices, funeral receptions, museums, 
<line: 14> and golf courses. Id. 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Here, the RFC limits Plaintiff to jobs involving exposure to at most moderate noise, or 
<line: 17> noise level three. AR 23. The ALJ stated, “[t]o reduce distraction, he is limited to jobs with a 
<line: 18> maximum noise level of three that requires no more than occasional public [contact] and no work 
<line: 19> as part of a team with coworkers.” AR 39. In the ALJ’s first determination before remand by the 
<line: 20> Appeals Council, the ALJ found that Plaintiff would be limited to noise level two. AR 167. In 
<line: 21> posing the hypothetical to the VE in the second hearing, after remand from the Appeals Council, 
<line: 22> the ALJ also started with Plaintiff limited to noise level two. AR 79. Only when the VE could 
<line: 23> not come up with any jobs that were both consistent with reasoning level one and noise level two 
<line: 24> (AR 79-81) did the ALJ increase to noise level three in a second hypothetical. AR 82.  

[TEXT]
<line: 26> Plaintiff contends that the medical evidence detailing his problems with distraction limits 
<line: 27> him to jobs involving exposure to at most noise level two. Plaintiff asserts that the ALJ appears 

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> PAGE 11 – OPINION AND ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> to have engaged in “results-based adjudication”—raising Plaintiff’s noise level to three because 
<line: 3> otherwise there were no jobs that Plaintiff could perform with all of his other limitations. 
<line: 4> Plaintiff argues that the ALJ’s reason to limit Plaintiff to noise level three is not sufficiently clear 
<line: 5> to allow for meaningful review by the Court. 

[TEXT]
<line: 7> There is ample medical evidence in the record demonstrating Plaintiff’s problems with 
<line: 8> distraction, attention, and related limitations. As previously noted, Dr. Sandoval, whose opinion 
<line: 9> was given “great weight” by the ALJ, found that “[a]s the amount of auditory information was 
<line: 10> increased, [Plaintiff’s] ability to process this was disproportionately decreased. As a 
<line: 11> consequence, for examples, on 2 of the latter test items, the test questions had to be repeated to 
<line: 12> [Plaintiff] 4 times.” AR 570. Dr. Sandoval additionally found that “[Plaintiff’s] auditory span is 
<line: 13> impaired and much smaller than the average person.” AR 573. Dr. Margaret Sutko, a Ph.D., 
<line: 14> wrote a Psychology Summary and Recommendations for Plaintiff in May 2006. AR 550. Dr. 
<line: 15> Sutko found that Plaintiff’s injury had a significant impact on his attention span, mental fluency, 
<line: 16> and processing speed and that he needed complex communications to be repeated. AR 550. 
<line: 17> Plaintiff had decreased visual spatial perception and decreased capacity to regulate thoughts, 
<line: 18> actions, and emotions, which resulted in impulsivity. AR 551. Dr. Sutko recommended 
<line: 19> decreasing distractions and repeated exposure to the same information. AR 550. The ALJ 
<line: 20> referenced Dr. Sutko’s examination and the majority of this evidence when determining 
<line: 21> Plaintiff’s RFC. AR 25.  

[TEXT]
<line: 23> Plaintiff also cites the 2013 medical opinion of Dr. Thomas Smurthwaite, PhD. AR 884-
<line: 24> 96. After conducting an assessment on April 5, 2013, Dr. Smurthwaite stated that Plaintiff’s 
<line: 25> testing showed “a fully oriented patient estimated to be of average premorbid intelligence who 
<line: 26> tested within normal limits in many cognitive domains, but problems were found.” AR 891. 

[TITLE]
<line: 28> PAGE 12 – OPINION AND ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Plaintiff had significant difficulties with attention and working memory. AR 889. Testing did not 
<line: 3> strongly suggest an executive-based fluency problem but suggested overall verbal slowness, 
<line: 4> likely indicating that Plaintiff had difficulty in dividing attention. AR 890. His executive 
<line: 5> functioning testing had mixed results, showing some cognitive inefficiency, poor strategy 
<line: 6> formation, difficulty with working memory, and significant slowness when a switching 
<line: 7> component was added. AR 890. Plaintiff also demonstrated focal executive functioning 
<line: 8> difficulties, which are mental control processes necessary to coordinate complex tasks and 
<line: 9> manage changing environmental conditions. AR 892. Dr. Smurthwaite stated that deficient 
<line: 10> executive functioning might affect many areas: organization; planning; behavior; working 
<line: 11> memory; regulating attention and emotions; problem solving; applying feedback; and taking 
<line: 12> corrective action. AR 892. Dr. Smurthwaite encouraged Plaintiff to stay in psychotherapy, 
<line: 13> continue doing vocational rehabilitation, work slowly when engaged in tasks, and suggested 
<line: 14> Plaintiff “might benefit from using earplugs” to minimize distraction. AR 893. 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> The ALJ considered additional evidence after the Appeals Council vacated and remanded 
<line: 17> his first decision. A form in this new evidence clarified the purpose and findings of 
<line: 18> Dr. Smurthwaite’s assessment: 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> The assessment I conducted on 4/5/2013 was designed to address 
<line: 21> medical diagnosis and treatment concerns. It was not designed to 
<line: 22> provide a comprehensive evaluation of the patient’s employability, 
<line: 23> and thus this was not addressed in the assessment. However, there 
<line: 24> were several findings which would have implications for the 
<line: 25> patient’s ability to hold down a job.  

[TEXT]
<line: 27> AR 996. Dr. Smurthwaite stated that his findings may indicate Plaintiff will have difficulty 
<line: 28> maintaining concentration, adequately using feedback from supervisors, maintaining a pace 
<line: 29> necessary for work, and effectively managing relationships with coworkers. AR 996. After 
<line: 30> considering this form and other additional evidence, the ALJ found the additional evidence 

[TITLE]
<line: 32> PAGE 13 – OPINION AND ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> considered upon remand “does not strengthen the claimant’s application. It does not show the 
<line: 3> claimant’s condition was worse than described in the previous decision.” AR 43.  

[TEXT]
<line: 5> The ALJ cited to Dr. Smurthwaite’s finding when creating Plaintiff’s RFC. AR 38-40. 
<line: 6> The ALJ gave the opinion of Dr. Smurthwaite partial weight because it was generally consistent 
<line: 7> with objective findings, but did not give it full weight for various reasons. First, the complaints 
<line: 8> of fatigue were inconsistent with Plaintiff’s denial of fatigue to Dr. Meyer. AR 39. Second, the 
<line: 9> assessment was designed to address medical diagnosis and treatment concerns and not as a 
<line: 10> comprehensive evaluation of Plaintiff’s employability. AR 40. Lastly, Dr. Smurthwaite did not 
<line: 11> describe the efficacy of Plaintiff’s treatment regimen nor describe the effects of substance abuse, 
<line: 12> treatment, and vocational rehabilitation. AR 40. 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> The ALJ’s reasons for choosing noise level of three are stated briefly throughout his 
<line: 15> opinion. After noting Dr. Sandoval’s finding, the ALJ states, “[a]ccordingly, the residual 
<line: 16> capacity limits the claimant to jobs with a reasoning level of one and a noise level of three.” 
<line: 17> AR 37. After noting the original evidence from Dr. Smurthwaite’s, the ALJ states, “[t]o reduce 
<line: 18> distraction, [Plaintiff] is limited to jobs with a maximum noise level of three that require no more 
<line: 19> than occasional public [contact] and no work as part of a team with coworkers.” AR 39. After 
<line: 20> considering Dr. Smurthwaite’s additional medical evidence, the ALJ stated, “the [RFC] accounts 
<line: 21> for significant attentional difficulties and executive functioning difficulties by liming Plaintiff to 
<line: 22> noise level of three and a reasoning level of one.” AR 40. 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> The ALJ did not adequately explain how the medical evidence supported a limitation of a 
<line: 25> noise level of three rather than two that would provide the Court the opportunity for meaningful 
<line: 26> review. An RFC assessment must include a narrative discussion describing how the evidence 
<line: 27> supports the conclusion. See SSR 96-8P, available at 1996 WL 374184, at *7. The evidence 

[TEXT]
<line: 29> PAGE 14 – OPINION AND ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> supports attentional difficulties and a need for reduced distraction, but the ALJ did not provide 
<line: 3> an explanation as to how noise level three drew from the medical evidence to address Plaintiff’s 
<line: 4> specific limitations. An ALJ cannot summarize evidence and merely posit a conclusion. See 
<line: 5> generally Garrison v. Colvin, 759 F.3d 995 (9th Cir. 2014).  

[TEXT]
<line: 7> The Court cannot meaningfully review how the ALJ decided that a moderate noise level 
<line: 8> was appropriate. The evidence supports that Plaintiff has issues with distraction and that his 
<line: 9> attentional issues correlate to executive functioning, memory, organization, self-regulation, and 
<line: 10> productivity. A rational reading of the evidence would not support loud or very loud work 
<line: 11> environments at noise levels of four and five. Further, noise level three is not appropriate when a 
<line: 12> claimant cannot work around excessive noise. See Gies v. Colvin, 2016 WL 494969, at *13 (E.D. 
<line: 13> Cal. Sept. 16, 2016). The question remains whether a moderate level of noise is appropriate for 
<line: 14> Plaintiff, and the ALJ did not provide an adequate narrative to explain how he arrived at this 
<line: 15> conclusion. Dr. Smurthwaite opined that Plaintiff needed “few distractions,” including 
<line: 16> distractions from noise. AR 893. The DOT classifies Plaintiff’s part-time job at as a receptionist 
<line: 17> at his college as a noise level two job. See SCO 237.367-038. Further, common sense dictates 
<line: 18> that requiring reduced distraction for school testing correlates more closely to a quiet 
<line: 19> environment like a library or private office, rather than a moderate level of noise similar to a 
<line: 20> business office where typewriters are used. Although Plaintiff’s school accommodation was 
<line: 21> termed a “moderate distraction-reduced testing environment,” the term “moderate” relates to 
<line: 22> school testing environments rather than the SCO’s spectrum of work environments. AR 1149.  

[TEXT]
<line: 24> The need for clear and specific reasoning to allow for meaningful review is even more 
<line: 25> apparent here in light of the ALJ’s original finding that Plaintiff could work in jobs with a 
<line: 26> maximum of noise level two and the ALJ’s first hypothetical question posed to the VE after 

[TITLE]
<line: 28> PAGE 15 – OPINION AND ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> remand by the Appeals Council that focused on noise level two jobs. Although the ALJ’s 
<line: 3> original assessment limiting Plaintiff to noise level two does not bind the ALJ or the Court, as 
<line: 4> part of the record, the original finding supports that even a moderate noise level may exceed 
<line: 5> Plaintiff’s limitations. Further, after remand by the Appeals Council, the ALJ did not cite any 
<line: 6> new evidence supporting that Plaintiff had a higher threshold for distraction or noise than the 
<line: 7> evidence previously suggested, but merely stated that the new evidence did not strengthen 
<line: 8> Plaintiff’s application or show the condition was worse than previously described. AR 43. Thus, 
<line: 9> the ALJ posed to the VE the first hypothetical with a restriction at noise level two. But the VE 
<line: 10> struggled to find noise level two jobs, commenting that he could find noise level three jobs. The 
<line: 11> VE ultimately did find some noise level two jobs, but they all had reasoning levels of two, which 
<line: 12> exceeded Plaintiff’s RFC. Only then did the ALJ provide the second hypothetical, with the noise 
<line: 13> level raised to three.   

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Plaintiff notes that this appears to be an ends-driven analysis. The Court recognizes the 
<line: 16> sequence of events offers some support for this conclusion. Regardless, the ALJ’s decision 
<line: 17> requires the Court to make more than “specific and legitimate inferences” about how the ALJ 
<line: 18> reached his decision and thus in order to conduct meaningful review, clearer reasoning and 
<line: 19> analysis is required. Cf. Magallanes v. Bowen, 881 F.2d 747, 755 (9th Cir. 1989) (noting that a 
<line: 20> court can make “specific and legitimate inferences” when an ALJ summarizes “facts and 
<line: 21> conflicting clinical evidence in [a] detailed and thorough fashion, stating his interpretation and 
<line: 22> making findings” and thus provides “specific and legitimate explanations”). 

[TITLE]
<line: 24> C. Vocational Rehabilitation 

[TEXT]
<line: 26> PAGE 16 – OPINION AND ORDER 
<line: 27> Plaintiff’s last assignment of error argues that the ALJ failed to incorporate the two 
<line: 28> opinions of Drs. Kordell N. Kennemer, Psy.D., and Paul Rethinger, Ph.D., that Plaintiff would 
<line: 29> benefit from vocational rehabilitation. AR 145, 156. Dr. Kennemer reviewed Plaintiff’s records 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> at the initial stage, and Dr. Rethinger reviewed at the reconsideration stage. Both stated in 
<line: 3> identical language that “[t]he clmt would benefit from voc rehab,” [sic] in response to the same 
<line: 4> question in a questionnaire asking the doctors to explain in narrative form Plaintiff’s adaptation 
<line: 5> limitations. AR 145, 156.  

[TEXT]
<line: 7> The ALJ did not err in failing to include these two recommendations into the RFC. The 
<line: 8> RFC is the maximum a claimant can do despite his or her limitations. See 20 C.F.R. 20 C.F.R. 
<line: 9> §§ 404.1545, 416.945. Plaintiff cites no case law finding that an ALJ erred by failing to 
<line: 10> incorporate suggested vocational rehabilitation as a limitation into an RFC. Plaintiff’s RFC 
<line: 11> reflected the maximum Plaintiff could do despite his limitations. Although Plaintiff may stand to 
<line: 12> benefit from vocational rehabilitation, that fact is irrelevant to what Plaintiff can do at the time 
<line: 13> the RFC was formulated, before any rehabilitation. Moreover, these doctors’ statements were 
<line: 14> recommendations and not imperatives, and thus were not required to be included in the RFC 
<line: 15> even if they were related to Plaintiff’s performance ability. See Carmickle v. Comm’r Soc. Sec., 
<line: 16> 533 F.3d 1155, 1165 (9th Cir. 2008).

<line: 18> D. Remand 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> PAGE 17 – OPINION AND ORDER 
<line: 21> Plaintiff argues the ALJ’s erred and there are no outstanding issues that must be resolved, 
<line: 22> thus this case should be remanded for immediate payment of benefits. Within the Court’s 
<line: 23> discretion under 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) is the “decision whether to remand for further proceedings 
<line: 24> or for an award of benefits.” Holohan v. Massanari, 246 F.3d 1195, 1210 (9th Cir. 2001) 
<line: 25> (citation omitted). Although a court should generally remand to the agency for additional 
<line: 26> investigation or explanation, a court has discretion to remand for immediate payment of benefits. 
<line: 27> Treichler v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec. Admin., 775 F.3d 1090, 1099-1100 (9th Cir. 2014). The issue 
<line: 28> turns on the utility of further proceedings. A remand for an award of benefits is appropriate when 
<line: 29> no useful purpose would be served by further administrative proceedings or when the record has 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> been fully developed and the evidence is insufficient to support the Commissioner’s decision. Id. 
<line: 3> at 1100.  

[TEXT]
<line: 5> The Court has found that the ALJ erred in determining Plaintiff’s RFC by failing to 
<line: 6> explain the decision to limit Plaintiff to noise level of three. The issue remains unresolved 
<line: 7> however, sufficient to preclude a remand for immediate payment of benefits. Although the ALJ 
<line: 8> did not sufficiently explain his reasoning in setting Plaintiff’s noise level, ambiguity remains as 
<line: 9> to the noise level limitation that is appropriate.2 Further investigation or assessment into the 
<line: 10> information provided by the medical sources of record, or possibly even seeking additional 
<line: 11> medical information, may be helpful in resolving this ambiguity.

<line: 26> 2 The Court notes that to the extent it is found, with sufficient reasoning and analysis 
<line: 27> provided, that the appropriate noise level limitation for Plaintiff is three, two of the jobs accepted 
<line: 28> by the ALJ in this case were still in error. Specifically, Plaintiff’s RFC limits him from working 
<line: 29> at heights and from climbing on ladders, ropes, and scaffolds, and yet the ALJ found that 
<line: 30> Plaintiff could perform the job of window cleaner. The VE testified that a person who cannot be 
<line: 31> exposed to heights could not perform the job of window washer. AR 86. Moreover, the SCO 
<line: 32> confirms that window cleaning requires frequent climbing. See SCO 389.687-014. The ALJ also 
<line: 33> found that Plaintiff could perform the job of advertiser distributor. Plaintiff, however, is limited 
<line: 34> to only occasional public contact. An advertiser distributor is required to distribute “from house 
<line: 35> to house, to business establishments, or to persons on [the] street, following oral instructions.”
