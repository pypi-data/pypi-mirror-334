<line: 20> ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> The Court grants Wells Fargo’s motion to dismiss (Dkt. No. 11) in its entirety. Berry’s Fair 
<line: 23> Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act claims are dismissed without prejudice as 
<line: 24> untimely. Berry’s Truth in Lending Act claim is dismissed with prejudice pursuant to Berry’s 
<line: 25> voluntary withdrawal. The Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the 
<line: 26> remainder of Berry’s state law claims and dismisses them without prejudice. Additionally, 
<line: 27> though HSBC has not appeared as a defendant, because the Court’s reasoning applies equally to 
<line: 28> both defendants here, the complaint is dismissed as to both Wells Fargo and HSBC. Berry may 
<line: 29> file an amended complaint, if he is able within the contours of this order, by December 29, 2015. 

[TITLE]
<line: 31> STATEMENT 

[TEXT]
<line: 33> After a state court foreclosed on his property and his challenges to the proceeding were 
<line: 34> unsuccessful, Plaintiff Derick Berry filed a suit in this Court against Defendants Wells Fargo 
<line: 35> Bank, N.A. and HSBC Bank, N.A., alleging a litany of claims based in both federal and state 
<line: 36> law. Specifically, Berry contends that the Defendants violated the Illinois Consumer & 
<line: 37> Deceptive Practices Act, 815 ILCS § 505/2 (Count I); the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. 
<line: 38> § 3601 et seq. (Count II); the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”), 15 U.S.C. § 1691 
<line: 39> (Count III); the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”); 15 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq. (Count IV); and that 
<line: 40> the Defendants were unjustly enriched, breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and 
<line: 41> committed negligence (Counts V-VII) by engaging in predatory mortgage practices against 
<line: 42> predominantly minority groups. (Dkt. No. 1.) Wells Fargo, the only defendant that has appeared 
<line: 43> in the case, now moves to dismiss Berry’s complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil 
<line: 44> Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim, respectively. 
<line: 45> (Dkt. No. 11.) Because Berry’s federal claims are time-barred and no independent basis for 
<line: 46> jurisdiction over the state law claims exists, the Court grants Wells Fargo’s motion to dismiss. 
<line: 47> Both the federal and state law claims are dismissed. 

[TITLE]
<line: 49> Background 

[TEXT]
<line: 51> The Court notes that the factual allegations in Berry’s complaint are disjointed and difficult to 
<line: 52> follow temporally. In 1991, Berry purchased a property located at 8754 South Cornell Avenue, 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Chicago, Illinois. (Dkt. No. 1, Compl. ¶ 8.) Berry continues to reside in that property today. (Id.) 
<line: 3> Berry originally financed the property by obtaining a $104,000 mortgage loan from Countrywide 
<line: 4> Home Loans. (Id. at ¶ 9.) On May 1, 2006, Berry refinanced his mortgage through Royal Crown 
<line: 5> Bancorp. (Id. at ¶ 13.) He refinanced to a 30-year, fixed rate mortgage with an 8.58% annual 
<line: 6> percentage rate. (Id.) 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> At some point, Berry sought to contest his monthly payments under the loan. On December 15, 
<line: 9> 2006, Berry phoned America’s Servicing Company (“ASC”), allegedly a Wells Fargo subsidiary, 
<line: 10> for clarification. (Id. at ¶¶ 26, 53.) He learned that ASC would take over as the servicer of the 
<line: 11> loan on January 2, 2007. (Id.) After Berry allegedly failed to make payments on the loan, GMAC 
<line: 12> Mortgage1 filed a foreclosure action in state court in December 2006. (Id. at ¶ 28.) Berry filed for 
<line: 13> bankruptcy but withdrew his petition in February 2009 after ASC allegedly offered him a 
<line: 14> forbearance agreement that would lead to a loan modification.2 (Id. at ¶¶ 32-35.) Berry alleges 
<line: 15> that a number of errors by ASC led to him being unable to accept the loan modification and that 
<line: 16> ASC sold his home to HSBC on March 12, 2010. (Id. at ¶ 54.) Outside of alleging that he 
<line: 17> received a few mailings from ASC representatives, Berry does not allege any ASC involvement 
<line: 18> in the servicing of his loan subsequent to 2009. 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Berry alleges that on October 28, 2011, the state court dismissed HSBC’s foreclosure lawsuit for 
<line: 21> want of prosecution. (Id. at ¶ 74.) The state court reinstated the foreclosure proceedings 
<line: 22> approximately one year later at HSBC’s request. (Id. at ¶ 78.)  The state court entered a judgment 
<line: 23> of foreclosure and sale on March 18, 2015. Berry challenged the foreclosure judgment and sale 
<line: 24> several times in the state court proceeding. After finding no success, this litigation followed.  

[TITLE]
<line: 26> Legal Standards 

[TEXT]
<line: 28> A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) challenges the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction. Fed. 
<line: 29> R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). When a defendant brings a facial challenge to subject matter jurisdiction, 
<line: 30> “the district court must accept as true all material allegations of the complaint, drawing all 
<line: 31> reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiff’s favor, unless standing is challenged as a factual 
<line: 32> matter.” Remijas v. Neiman Marcus Group, LLC, 794 F.3d 688, 691 (7th Cir. 2015). If, however, 
<line: 33> as here, a defendant factually challenges the basis for federal jurisdiction, “the district court may 
<line: 34> properly look beyond the jurisdictional allegations of the complaint and view whatever evidence 
<line: 35> has been submitted on the issue to determine whether in fact subject matter jurisdiction exists.” 
<line: 36> Apex Digital, Inc. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 572 F.3d 440, 444 (7th Cir. 2009) (citation and 
<line: 37> internal quotation marks and annotation omitted). 

[TEXT]
<line: 39> A Rule 12(b)(6) motion challenges the sufficiency of the complaint. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). 
<line: 40> To survive dismissal, a complaint must provide enough factual information to “state a claim to 
<line: 41> relief that is plausible on its face.” Defender Sec. Co. v. First Mercury Ins. Co., 803 F.3d 327, 
<line: 42> 334 (7th Cir. 2015). “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that 
<line: 43> allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct 
<line: 44> alleged.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). The Court draws all reasonable inferences 
<line: 45> and construes all facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Vesely v. Armslist LLC, 762 
<line: 46> F.3d 661, 664 (7th Cir. 2014). 

[ABANDON]
<line: 48> 1 Berry did not name GMAC Mortgage as a defendant in this litigation. Later in his complaint, Berry states that 
<line: 49> HSBC is the entity responsible for the foreclosure proceedings. 
<line: 50> 2 Berry received a loan modification package from ASC on August 24, 2009 and November 17, 2009. 

[TITLE]
<line: 2> Discussion 

[TITLE]
<line: 4> A. 
<line: 5> Subject Matter Jurisdiction 

[TEXT]
<line: 7> Wells Fargo argues that all of Berry’s claims stem from the state court’s foreclosure proceeding. 
<line: 8> It therefore contends that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Berry’s complaint 
<line: 9> because his claims are barred by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. The Rooker-Feldman doctrine 
<line: 10> divests district courts from exercising jurisdiction over “cases brought by state-court losers 
<line: 11> complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court 
<line: 12> proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.” 
<line: 13> Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 544 U.S. 280, 284 (2005) (citing 28 U.S.C. 
<line: 14> § 1257); see also Iqbal v. Patel, 780 F.3d 728, 730 (7th Cir. 2015). While the doctrine precludes 
<line: 15> claims that seek redress for injury caused by state-court judgments, see Johnson v. Orr, 551 F.3d 
<line: 16> 564, 568 (7th Cir. 2008) (“If the injury the plaintiff complains of resulted from, or is inextricably 
<line: 17> intertwined with, a state court judgment, then lower federal courts cannot hear the claim.”), it 
<line: 18> does not prevent a plaintiff from receiving an audience in federal court while the state court 
<line: 19> proceeding is ongoing. See Parker v. Lyons, 757 F.3d 701, 705-06 (7th Cir. 2014) (“Rooker-
<line: 20> Feldman does not bar the claims of federal-court plaintiffs who . . . file a federal suit when a 
<line: 21> state-court appeal is pending.”); TruServ Corp. v. Flegles, Inc., 419 F.3d 584, 591 (7th Cir. 2005) 
<line: 22> (“an interlocutory ruling does not evoke the doctrine or preclude federal jurisdiction”).  

[TEXT]
<line: 24> The doctrine is inapplicable here because in Illinois, the entry of a judgment of foreclosure is not 
<line: 25> final; instead, it becomes final and appealable only after the trial court confirms the sale of the 
<line: 26> underlying property and directs distribution of the resulting funds. See EMC Mortg. Corp. v. 
<line: 27> Kemp, 982 N.E.2d 152, 154 (Ill. 2012). Here, despite Berry’s acknowledgement that his suit 
<line: 28> revolves around the fact that the state court “never read, recognized, or responded” to his current 
<line: 29> arguments, the doctrine does not apply. The state court entered a judgment of foreclosure on 
<line: 30> March 18, 2015 and Wells Fargo concedes that the state court has not yet entered an order 
<line: 31> confirming the sale of the property. (Dkt. No. 12 at 6.) Even though Berry’s current arguments 
<line: 32> are best categorized as rehashed versions of unsuccessful contentions in state court, because he 
<line: 33> filed his federal complaint before the state court confirmed the sale of his property, Rooker-
<line: 34> Feldman is unavailable as a basis for dismissal. See, e.g., Schuller v. America’s Wholesale 
<line: 35> Lender, No. 14 C 4097, 2015 WL 5316413, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 9, 2015); Bolden v. Wells 
<line: 36> Fargo Bank, N.A., No. 14 C 403, 2014 WL 6461690, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 18, 2014). 

[TITLE]
<line: 38> B. 
<line: 39> Federal Claims 

[TEXT]
<line: 41> Berry attempts to bring three federal claims against Wells Fargo for violations of the FHA, 
<line: 42> ECOA, and TILA. None are timely.3  

[TEXT]
<line: 44> The FHA provides for a two-year statute of limitations where a private person seeks to enforce 
<line: 45> its terms. See 42 U.S.C. § 3613(a)(1)(A) (“An aggrieved person may commence a civil action . . . 
<line: 46> not later than 2 years after the occurrence or the termination of an alleged discriminatory housing 
<line: 47> practice . . .”). Here, Berry’s FHA claim seeks redress under the “real estate-related transactions” 
<line: 48> subchapter. (Dkt. No. 1 at 17; see 42 U.S.C. § 3605(a).) Section 3605 of the FHA makes it 

[ABANDON]
<line: 50> 3 Berry voluntarily withdrew his TILA claim. (Dkt. No. 17 at 7.) Accordingly, the Court dismisses it with prejudice 
<line: 51> as abandoned. 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> unlawful for “any person or other entity whose business includes engaging in residential real 
<line: 3> estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a 
<line: 4> transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race, color, religion, 
<line: 5> sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 3605(a). The FHA defines 
<line: 6> residential real estate-related transactions as “[t]he making or purchasing of loans or providing 
<line: 7> other financial assistance” related to residential real estate, and “[t]he selling, brokering, or 
<line: 8> appraising of residential real property.” 42 U.S.C. § 3605(b). Berry’s FHA claim appears to 
<line: 9> emanate from the terms and conditions associated with the mortgage he entered into in 
<line: 10> May 2006. See Dkt. No. 1 at 16 (“Plaintiff was induced to sign and rely on defendants’ false 
<line: 11> assertions, and plaintiff did rely to his detriment on documents providing for a loan that was 
<line: 12> unnecessarily expensive and made on less favorable terms than loans defendants offered to 
<line: 13> similarly-situated Caucasians.”) Berry did not file this action until June 15, 2015, making any 
<line: 14> challenge to his original loan pursuant to the FHA tardy by over seven years. Even when viewing 
<line: 15> the facts in the light most favorable to Berry, as the Court must, the most recent alleged “real 
<line: 16> estate-related transaction” took place in November 2009, when Berry contends he attempted to 
<line: 17> enter into a loan modification but was thwarted by Wells Fargo’s misconduct. The statutory 
<line: 18> period on this activity likewise expired long before Berry brought his claim in this Court. Wells 
<line: 19> Fargo’s involvement in the state court foreclosure action4, if any, does not qualify as a real 
<line: 20> estate-related “transaction” under the FHA and therefore does not make his claim timely. See, 
<line: 21> e.g., Jordan v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 91 F. Supp. 3d 491, 504 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (finding that 
<line: 22> garnishment action alleged to be “linked back to a property fraud action” did not fall under FHA 
<line: 23> because “not all activities related to residential real estate-related transactions” invoke the FHA); 
<line: 24> Moore v. F.D.I.C., No. 08 C 596, 2009 WL 4405538, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 30, 2009) (dismissing 
<line: 25> a Section 3605 claim because the plaintiffs alleged misconduct occurring post-default). The 
<line: 26> institution of foreclosure proceedings was not a “transaction” as the FHA defines. When 
<line: 27> foreclosure proceedings began against Berry, Wells Fargo was not making or purchasing a loan, 
<line: 28> providing other financial assistance, or selling, brokering, or appraising residential property. 
<line: 29> Accordingly, Berry fails to assert a timely claim under the FHA.5 

[TEXT]
<line: 31> Berry’s ECOA claim is similarly untimely for the reasons set forth in greater detail above. The 
<line: 32> ECOA makes it unlawful for creditors to “discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any 
<line: 33> aspect of a credit transaction . . . on the basis of race.” 15 U.S.C. § 1691(a); see Estate of Davis 
<line: 34> v. Wells Fargo Bank, 633 F.3d 529, 538 (7th Cir. 2011). Like the FHA, the ECOA limits the 
<line: 35> institution of causes of action to two years from the date of the incident. 15 U.S.C. § 1691e(f).6 
<line: 36> As stated above, the latest alleged “credit transaction” that could qualify as an “adverse action” 
<line: 37> under the ECOA was Berry’s November 2009 attempt to receive a loan modification. The 
<line: 38> foreclosure proceedings and all the allegations that accompany those proceedings do not fall 
<line: 39> within the “adverse action” definition necessary to state an ECOA claim. See 12 C.F.R. 
<line: 40> § 202.2(c)(2)(ii) (adverse action term does not include “[a]ny action or forbearance relating to an 

[ABANDON]
<line: 42> 4 The letters Berry alleges he received are most properly construed as discovery deriving from the state court 
<line: 43> foreclosure proceedings. They cannot be plausibly interpreted as attempts to enter into or modify a loan. 
<line: 44> 5 The Court additionally notes that Berry’s argument in his response brief that his FHA claim is timely because 
<line: 45> Wells Fargo has made his home unavailable to him through the course of foreclosure is unsupported by either legal 
<line: 46> authority or facts. Berry cites to no case law that stands for the proposition that a lender must physically make a 
<line: 47> home available to be in compliance with the FHA. More fundamentally, however, his argument is undermined by 
<line: 48> his complaint, where Berry states that he “still resides” in the underlying property today. (Compl. ¶ 8.) 
<line: 49> 6 Since the relevant time period, the ECOA’s statute of limitations has been amended to five years. The amended 
<line: 50> statute of limitations does not apply retroactively. See Estate of Davis, 633 F.3d at 538 (applying two-year statute). 
<line: 51> Even if the applicable limitations period was five years, Berry’s ECOA claim would nevertheless be untimely. 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> account taken in connection with inactivity, default, or delinquency as to that account'). Berry
<line: 3> therefore is unable to assert a timely claim under the ECOA. Because Berry's FHA and ECOA
<line: 4> claims are untimely and he withdrew his TILA claim, the Court dismisses all three federal
<line: 5> claims.

[TITLE]
<line: 7> C.
<line: 8> State Law Claims

[TEXT]
<line: 10> Because the Court dismisses all of Berry's federal claims, it declines to exercise supplemental
<line: 11> jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.' See 28 U.S.C. s 1367(c) (district court may
<line: 12> decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims where it has dismissed all
<line: 13> claims over which it has original jurisdiction); see also RwJ Mgmt. Co., Inc. v. BP Prods. N.
<line: 14> Am., Inc., 672 F.3d 476, 478 (7th Cir. 2012) ("When federal claims drop out of the case, leaving
<line: 15> only state-law claims, the district court has broad discretion to decide whether to keep the case or
<line: 16> relinquish supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims.')..

[TITLE]
<line: 18> D.
<line: 19> HSBC

[TEXT]
<line: 21> HSBC has not appeared as a defendant in this matter and the Court is unable to discern whether
<line: 22> Berry has served HSBC with his complaint. Nevertheless, because the Court's findings requiring
<line: 23> dismissal of Berry's complaint apply equally to both Wells Fargo and HsBC, the Court
<line: 24> dismisses the complaint against both defendants despite only Wells Fargo making an appearance.
<line: 25> See King v. Peters, 991 F.2d 799 (7th Cir. 1993) (court may sua sponte enter judgment in favor
<line: 26> of additional non-moving defendants if motion brought by one defendant equally bars claims
<line: 27> against another defendant and the plaintiff had an adequate opportunity to respond to the
<line: 28> motion); Malak v. Associated Physicians, Inc., 784 F.2d 277, 280 (7th Cir. 1986) (same); see
<line: 29> also, e.g., Bolden, 2014 WL 6461690 at * 6; Roberts v. Cendant Mortg. Corp., No. 1:11-CV-
<line: 30> 01438-JMS, 2013 WL 2467996, at *5 (S.D. Ind. June 7, 2013) (court imputed arguments made
<line: 31> by moving defendant to all defendants and dismissed claims universally)..

[TITLE]
<line: 33> Conclusion

[TEXT]
<line: 35> For the reasons stated herein, the Court grants Wells Fargo's motion to dismiss (Dkt. No. 11).
<line: 36> Berry's FHA and ECOA claims are dismissed, without prejudice, as untimely. Berry may
<line: 37> attempt to amend his allegations by December 29, 2014 within the contours of this order. Berry's
<line: 38> TILA claim is dismissed with prejudice. The Court dismisses Berry's state law claims without
<line: 39> prejudice as it declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.
