[TITLE]
<line: 20> ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> This matter comes before the Court sua sponte. On July 
<line: 23> 7, 2016, Defendant Ascenda USA Inc. filed its Notice of 
<line: 24> Removal. (Doc. # 1). For the reasons stated herein, the Court 
<line: 25> determines remand is appropriate.  

[TITLE]
<line: 27> I. 
<line: 28> Background 

[TEXT]
<line: 30> Ascenda hired Plaintiff Autumn Terrell as a customer 
<line: 31> service representative on June 12, 2014. (Doc. # 2 at ¶ 11). 
<line: 32> Terrell suffers from a qualifying disability under the 
<line: 33> Florida Civil Rights Act, Fla. Stat. § 760.01 et seq., and 
<line: 34> requested an accommodation in May of 2015. (Id. at ¶¶ 12, 
<line: 35> 15). Ascenda denied Terrell’s requested accommodation and 
<line: 36> between May and June of 2015, Ascenda disciplined Terrell for 
<line: 37> “missing work on account of her handicap, even though 
<line: 38> Plaintiff informed Defendant of these absences in advance,

[TEXT]
<line: 4> and submitted medical documentation to Defendant in support 
<line: 5> of each absence.” (Id. at ¶¶ 17, 20). Ascenda allegedly also 
<line: 6> allowed information regarding Terrell’s disability to be 
<line: 7> disseminated throughout the facility at which Terrell worked. 
<line: 8> (Id. at ¶ 21). Furthermore, Ascenda allegedly retaliated 
<line: 9> against Terrell for engaging in protected activity under the 
<line: 10> Florida Civil Rights Act by terminating her on June 22, 2015. 
<line: 11> (Id. at ¶ 24).  

[TEXT]
<line: 13> Terrell subsequently instituted an action against 
<line: 14> Ascenda by filing a complaint in the Sixth Judicial Circuit 
<line: 15> in and for Pinellas County, Florida on May 5, 2016. (Doc. # 
<line: 16> 1 at 1). Terrell’s complaint asserts three counts under the 
<line: 17> Florida Civil Rights Act and requests a litany of damages 
<line: 18> including lost wages, front pay, compensatory damages for 
<line: 19> emotional distress, punitive damages, prejudgment interest 
<line: 20> and attorney’s fees and costs. (Doc. # 2 at 4-5, 7). However, 
<line: 21> the amount in controversy is only alleged in a generic fashion 
<line: 22> as being “in excess of $15,000.” (Id. at ¶ 1). Ascenda removed 
<line: 23> to this Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.

<line: 4> the power but also the obligation at any time to inquire into 
<line: 5> jurisdiction whenever the possibility that jurisdiction does 
<line: 6> not exist arises.” Fitzgerald v. Seaboard Sys. R.R., Inc., 
<line: 7> 760 F.2d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir. 1985) (per curiam).  

[TEXT]
<line: 9> When jurisdiction is premised upon diversity of 
<line: 10> citizenship, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a) requires that “the matter in 
<line: 11> controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of 
<line: 12> interest and costs.” When “the jurisdictional amount is not 
<line: 13> facially apparent from the complaint, the court should look 
<line: 14> to the notice of removal and may require evidence relevant to 
<line: 15> the amount in controversy at the time the case was removed.” 
<line: 16> Williams v. Best Buy Co., 269 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir. 
<line: 17> 2001). And, if “damages are unspecified, the removing party 
<line: 18> bears the burden of establishing the jurisdictional amount by 
<line: 19> a preponderance of the evidence.” Lowery v. Ala. Power Co., 
<line: 20> 483 F.3d 1184, 1208 (11th Cir. 2007).

<line: 22> A. 
<line: 23> Lost Wages 

[TEXT]
<line: 25> Ascenda calculates lost wages as two years of back pay 
<line: 26> (one year of pre-removal and one year of post-removal back 
<line: 27> pay), plus one year of front pay. (Doc. # 1 at 5). There are 
<line: 28> two flaws with Ascenda’s calculation, however. First, the 
<line: 29> amount in controversy is determined at the time of removal 
<line: 30> and thus does not include post-removal back pay. Williams,

<line: 7> 2441900, at *2 (M.D. Fla. May 30, 2014)). Second, “speculation 
<line: 8> regarding front pay cannot be used to supplement insufficient 
<line: 9> back pay for the purpose of meeting the jurisdictional 
<line: 10> requirement.” Id. (citing Snead v. AAR Mfg., Inc., No. 8:09-

<line: 12> 2009)).  

[TEXT]
<line: 14> Therefore, the amount in controversy for lost wages is 
<line: 15> properly calculated as wages per week multiplied by the number 
<line: 16> of weeks from the date of termination to the date of removal. 
<line: 17> Ascenda 
<line: 18> provided 
<line: 19> evidence 
<line: 20> establishing 
<line: 21> Terrell 
<line: 22> earned 
<line: 23> approximately $360 per week (Doc. # 1-2 at 35), and 54.43 
<line: 24> weeks elapsed between Terrell’s termination and the date of 
<line: 25> removal. As such, the amount of back pay equals $19,594.80.

<line: 28> Compensatory Damages  

[TEXT]
<line: 30> Ascenda 
<line: 31> further 
<line: 32> postulates 
<line: 33> Terrell’s 
<line: 34> compensatory 
<line: 35> damages claim is sufficient to meet the amount in controversy 
<line: 36> threshold because courts have awarded amounts in excess of 
<line: 37> the $75,000 threshold for emotional distress claims. (Doc. # 
<line: 38> 1 at 5). Ascenda also relies on Estevez-Gonzalez v. Kraft, 
<line: 39> Inc., 606 F. Supp. 127, 129 (S.D. Fla. 1985), for the

[TEXT]
<line: 4> proposition that a complaint alleging physical and mental 
<line: 5> pain meets the amount in controversy requirement. (Doc. # 1 
<line: 6> at 6). Notably though, at the time Estevez-Gonzalez was 
<line: 7> decided, the amount in controversy requirement was a mere 
<line: 8> $10,000. See 606 F. Supp. at 129. In stark contrast, the 
<line: 9> amount in controversy requirement today is $75,000, 28 U.S.C. 
<line: 10> § 1332(a), and Ascenda provides nothing in support of its 
<line: 11> contention that Terrell’s claim to compensatory damages could 
<line: 12> exceed today’s jurisdictional threshold. As such, Terrell’s 
<line: 13> claim for compensatory damages is too speculative to support 
<line: 14> a finding that the $75,000 threshold has been satisfied. See 
<line: 15> Boyd v. N. Tr. Co., No. 8:15-cv-2928-T-33TBM, 2016 WL 640529, 
<line: 16> at *4 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 18, 2016) (finding compensatory damages 
<line: 17> too speculative to base jurisdiction upon because neither 
<line: 18> party presented evidence regarding an estimation of those 
<line: 19> damages).  

[TITLE]
<line: 21> C. 
<line: 22> Punitive Damages 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Ascenda correctly notes Terrell requests punitive 
<line: 25> damages and the Florida Civil Rights Act provides for up to 
<line: 26> $100,000 in such damages. A court must consider punitive 
<line: 27> damages in its jurisdictional analysis “unless it is apparent 
<line: 28> to a legal certainty that such cannot be recovered.” Holley 
<line: 29> Equip. Co. v. Credit Alliance Corp., 821 F.2d 1531, 1535 (11th

<line: 4> Cir. 1987). Relying on Ryan v. State Farm Auto Ins. Co., 934 
<line: 5> F.2d 276, 277 (11th Cir. 1991), Ascenda argues Terrell’s 
<line: 6> request for punitive damages is sufficient to meet the amount 
<line: 7> in controversy requirement because the Florida Civil Rights 
<line: 8> Act caps punitive damages at $100,000. (Doc. # 1 at 6). A key 
<line: 9> distinction between Ryan and the instant action, however, is 
<line: 10> that the plaintiff in Ryan requested a specific amount in 
<line: 11> punitive damages, whereas in this case the request is 
<line: 12> nonspecific.  

[TEXT]
<line: 14> Furthermore, a similar argument was rejected by the 
<line: 15> court in Boyd. In that case, the removing defendant argued 
<line: 16> the plaintiff’s request for punitive damages under the 
<line: 17> Florida Civil Rights Act was sufficient to meet the amount in 
<line: 18> controversy requirement. 2016 WL 640529, at *4. The 
<line: 19> defendant, however, did not provide jurisdictional facts that 
<line: 20> affirmatively established punitive damages were at play. Id. 
<line: 21> Rather, the defendant merely pointed to the fact the plaintiff 
<line: 22> requested punitive damages. Id. Likewise, rather than 
<line: 23> providing jurisdictional facts to affirmatively show punitive 
<line: 24> damages are at play here, Ascenda only points to the fact 
<line: 25> Terrell requests punitive damages.

<line: 8> reasonable
<line: 9> attorney's
<line: 10> fees

[TITLE]
<line: 18> III. Conclusion

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Ascenda, as the removing party, has not shown by.
<line: 21> a
<line: 22> preponderance of the evidence that the amount in controversy
<line: 23> exceeds $75,000. And, "[i]f at any time before final judgment
<line: 24> it appears that the district court lacks subject matter
<line: 25> jurisdiction,
<line: 26> the case shall be remanded." 28 U.s.C.
<line: 27> S
<line: 28> 1447(c). Therefore, the Court remands this action.

[TEXT]
<line: 30> Accordingly, it is

[TITLE]
<line: 32> ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED:

[TEXT]
<line: 34> This action is remanded under 28 U.s.c S 1447(c) for

<line: 37> effected, the Clerk shall close this case.
