<line: 25> ORDER AND OPINION

[TEXT]
<line: 27> Plaintiff seeks leave to file the instant civil rights action without paying the
<line: 28> $350.00 filing fee. According to Subsection (g) of 28 U.S.C. $ 1915, a prisoner
<line: 29> is prohibited from bringing a civil action in federal court in forma pauperis "if the
<line: 30> prisoner has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any
<line: 31> facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was.
<line: 32> dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim
<line: 33> upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger
<line: 34> of serious physical injury.".

[TEXT]
<line: 36> This Court's records indicate that Plaintiff has filed numerous complaints
<line: 37> and appeals, the following of which were dismissed prior to service of process as
<line: 38> frivolous: Terrell y. Grady Mem'l Hosp., Civil Action No. 1:08-CV-3931-TWT
