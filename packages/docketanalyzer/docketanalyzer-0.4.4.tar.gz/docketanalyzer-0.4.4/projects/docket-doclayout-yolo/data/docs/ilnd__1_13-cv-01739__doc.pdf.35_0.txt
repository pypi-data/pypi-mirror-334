[TITLE]
<line: 22> MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

[TEXT]
<line: 24> This Court has been puzzled from the outset by more than one
<line: 25> disconnect between (1) the allegations of the employment
<line: 26> discrimination Complaint brought by pro se plaintiff Michael
<line: 27> Ruffin-El (“Ruffin-El”) against Saint-Gobain Containers, Inc.
<line: 28> (“Saint-Gobain”) and (2) the documents that he has attached as
<line: 29> exhibits to the Complaint -- disconnects that bear on its
<line: 30> timeliness or untimeliness:1

[TEXT]
<line: 32> 1.
<line: 33> Complaint ¶7.1(a)(I) refers to Ruffin-El having
<line: 34> filed a Charge of Discrimination with EEOC on or about
<line: 35> February 6, 2012, although the photocopy of the Charge of
<line: 36> Discrimination attached to the Complaint was signed by him
<line: 37> in July 2011 and bore an EEOC “RECEIVED” stamp dated July

[ABANDON]
<line: 39> Before now this Court’s June 28, 2013 memorandum order
<line: 40> 1
<line: 41> had dealt with Ruffin-El’s improper effort to include “national
<line: 42> origin” discrimination as an additional ground for his lawsuit
<line: 43> even though that ground had not been included in his
<line: 44> administrative Charge of Discrimination.

<line: 2> 25, 2011.2

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 2.
<line: 5> Complaint ¶8(b) alleges that Ruffin-El received
<line: 6> EEOC’s right-to-sue letter on December 9, 2012, even though
<line: 7> the right-to-sue letter attached to the Complaint, which
<line: 8> notified him of a 90-day deadline for filing suit, was dated
<line: 9> September 25, 2012 (2-1/2 months earlier).

[TEXT]
<line: 11> 3.
<line: 12> Another exhibit to the Complaint was a February
<line: 13> 21, 2013 letter from an Indiana law firm declining to take
<line: 14> on Ruffin-El’s case and suggesting that he file a pro se
<line: 15> action to perserve his legal rights.  That letter referred
<line: 16> to Ruffin-El’s representation that he received a “second
<line: 17> right-to-sue notice” on December 10, 2012, so that he had
<line: 18> until March 11, 2013 to file suit.  But nothing suggests the
<line: 19> existence of any “second right-to-sue notice” -- instead
<line: 20> that December 2012 date had to have been the time, referred
<line: 21> to in Complaint ¶8(b), that Ruffin-El received the original
<line: 22> September 25, 2012 letter when it was remailed (more of this
<line: 23> later).

[TEXT]
<line: 25> Saint-Gobain understandably moved to dismiss all of Ruffin-

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> If the unexplained February 2012 date refers to a
<line: 28> 2
<line: 29> Charge of Discrimination different from the one attached to the
<line: 30> Complaint, that Charge would have been untimely in any event, for
<line: 31> Ruffin-El’s discrimination claims are based on the failure of
<line: 32> Saint-Gobain to have hired him in November 2010, more than 300
<line: 33> days before the February 2012 date.  In that respect the July
<line: 34> 2011 Charge of Discrimination attached to the Complaint listed
<line: 35> November 22, 2010 as the latest date on which discrimination had
<line: 36> taken place.

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> El’s claims on the basis of the lawsuit’s asserted untimeliness. 
<line: 3> Although its motion specified other grounds for dismissal as
<line: 4> well, this memorandum opinion and order will limit itself to the
<line: 5> question of timeliness without speaking to those other possible
<line: 6> grounds.

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Added light was cast on the issue of timeliness vel non when
<line: 9> Ruffin-El filed a self-prepared Amended Complaint, using a
<line: 10> different Clerk’s-Office-supplied form from the one he had
<line: 11> employed for the original Complaint.  Here is Ruffin-El’s
<line: 12> relevant assertion from the Amended Complaint’s Statement of
<line: 13> Claim (its Paragraph IV):

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Plaintiff filed complaint on March 6th in year 2013.  The
<line: 16> Plaintiff did receive notice to sue on December 6th, 2012. 
<line: 17> The E.E.O.C. (Equal Employment Com.), originally mailed
<line: 18> notice to the Plaintiff’s previous address.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> And Ex. A to the Amended Complaint was a photocopy of an envelope
<line: 21> that showed a September 25, 2012 mailing by EEOC and contained
<line: 22> this stamped legend:

[TEXT]
<line: 24> RETURN TO SENDER
<line: 25> NOT DELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED
<line: 26> UNABLE TO FORWARD

[TEXT]
<line: 28> Another photocopied EEOC envelope, also part of Ex. A, showed a
<line: 29> December 3, 2012 mailing to Ruffin-El at an address in Gilbert,
<line: 30> Arizona, totally different from the address (414 W. Brinkley
<line: 31> Loop, Apt. 8, Marion, Arizona) that Ruffin-El had furnished EEOC
<line: 32> in his Charge of Discrimination -- and of course the right-to-sue
<line: 33> letter that was sent in September 2012 had understandably been

[ABANDON]
<line: 35> 3

[TEXT]
<line: 2> directed to that earlier address as well.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> All of that being so, Ruffin-El has pleaded himself out of
<line: 5> court on untimeliness grounds under the established authority in
<line: 6> this Circuit (and elsewhere as well).  Nearly three decades ago
<line: 7> our Court of Appeals held in St. Louis v. Alverno Coll.,744 F.2d
<line: 8> 1314, 1316-17 (7th Cir. 1984) that any claimant such as Ruffin-El
<line: 9> had the express burden of keeping EEOC apprised of any change in
<line: 10> the claimant’s address from the one originally furnished to that
<line: 11> agency:

[TEXT]
<line: 13> Since 1977 people who have filed charges with the EEOC have
<line: 14> been required to notify the Commission of any change of
<line: 15> address.  42 Fed.Reg. 27,833 (Sept. 22, 1977).  The
<line: 16> regulation, 29 C.F.R. § 1601.7(b)(1981), makes mandatory
<line: 17> that which was dictated already by common sense.  The
<line: 18> regulation provides that a person who has filed a Title VII
<line: 19> charge “has the responsibility to provide the Commission
<line: 20> with notice of any change in an address and with notice of
<line: 21> any prolonged absence from that current address so that he
<line: 22> or she can be located when necessary during the Commission’s
<line: 23> consideration of the charge.”  Id.

[TEXT]
<line: 25> The burden of providing the EEOC with changes of address is
<line: 26> minimal. It is unreasonable to expect the EEOC to pore over
<line: 27> its files, and those of state administrative agencies, in an
<line: 28> effort to ascertain which of the addresses contained therein
<line: 29> is correct.  We would then undoubtedly hear cases in which
<line: 30> the EEOC had made a good-faith effort to find a claimant’s
<line: 31> current address but had guessed wrong and sent the notice fo
<line: 32> the wrong place.  The claimant is obviously in a far better
<line: 33> position to ensure that the Commission has current, accurate
<line: 34> information and to provide that information in much less
<line: 35> time than it would take an EEOC employee to go though the
<line: 36> claimant’s file.

[TEXT]
<line: 38> After referring to decisions by other courts that had reached the
<line: 39> same conclusion, St. Louis, id. at 1317 announced the Court of
<line: 40> Appeals’ bottom-line holding:

[ABANDON]
<line: 42> 4

[TEXT]
<line: 2> In this case, however, plaintiff’s failure to tell the EEOC
<line: 3> that he moved was not an event beyond his control. 
<line: 4> Accordingly, we hold that the ninety-day limit began running
<line: 5> on the date the notice was delivered to the most recent
<line: 6> address plaintiff provided the EEOC.

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Nor has the passage of time altered that analysis.  Bobbitt
<line: 9> v. Freeman Cos., 268 F.3d 535 (7th Cir. 2001) affirmed a decision
<line: 10> by this Court that had dismissed an employment discrimination on
<line: 11> the same ground.  Here is the comparable language from Bobbitt,

[TEXT]
<line: 13> id. at 538 (case citations other than St. Louis omitted:

[TEXT]
<line: 15> A Title VII plaintiff must file her suit within 90 days from
<line: 16> the date the EEOC “gives notice” of her right to sue. In
<line: 17> most situations, the statutory 90-day filing period
<line: 18> commences when the plaintiff receives actual notice of her
<line: 19> right to sue. However, when the claimant does not receive
<line: 20> the notice in a timely fashion due to her own fault, the
<line: 21> “actual notice” rule does not apply.  St. Louis v. Alverno
<line: 22> College, 744 F.2d 1314, 1316-17 (7th Cir. 1984). For
<line: 23> example, if a claimant fails to notify the EEOC of a change
<line: 24> of address, then the claimant cannot later rely on the
<line: 25> “actual notice” rule.  Id. at 1317.

[TEXT]
<line: 27> In short, Saint-Gobain’s motion seeking dismissal of all of
<line: 28> Ruffin-El’s claims because they were untimely filed is soundly
<line: 29> grounded in legal doctrine that is binding on this Court. 
<line: 30> Because the statutory 90-day clock began to tick a few days after
<line: 31> EEOC first mailed its right to sue letter on September 25, 2012,3
<line: 32> Ruffin-El’s March 2013 Complaint was filed more than two months 

[ABANDON]
<line: 34> That tacking on of a few days is to allow for the time
<line: 35> 3
<line: 36> normally required for transmittal of the mail from the sender to
<line: 37> the recipient

[ABANDON]
<line: 39> 5

[TEXT]
<line: 2> too late.
<line: 3> Saint Gobain's motion to dismiss this action is
<line: 4> granted.
