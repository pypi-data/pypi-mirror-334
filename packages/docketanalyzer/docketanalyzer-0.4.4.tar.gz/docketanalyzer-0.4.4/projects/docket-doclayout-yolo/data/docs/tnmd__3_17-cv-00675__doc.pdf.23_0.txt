[TITLE]
<line: 12> ORDER AND ORDER FOR DEFENDANT TO SHOW CAUSE 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> Pending before the Court is Plaintiffs’ motion to continue the initial case management 
<line: 15> conference scheduled for January 22, 2018 (Docket No. 22), which is GRANTED, but on the 
<line: 16> conditions discussed below.    

[TEXT]
<line: 18> This case has a rocky history, which is recited in Chief Judge Crenshaw’s order of 
<line: 19> December 15, 2017 (Docket No. 19).  Because an initial case management conference has not yet 
<line: 20> been held, there is no plan or schedule for the progression of this case toward disposition, despite 
<line: 21> the fact that the case has been pending for almost 10 months.  Additionally, although Plaintiffs’ 
<line: 22> proposed case management order (Docket No. 21) recites conversations between Plaintiffs’ 
<line: 23> counsel and an attorney for the only remaining Defendant, Jean Perez, no appearance has been 
<line: 24> entered by an attorney on behalf of Defendant Perez.1   Nor did Defendant Perez file an answer by 
<line: 25> October 2, 2017, as required by the Court’s order of September 15, 2017 (Docket No. 13).  

[TEXT]
<line: 27> Therefore, in an effort to get this case on track, the Court ORDERS the following: 

[TEXT]
<line: 29> 1. 
<line: 30> The initial case management conference is RESCHEDULED for Wednesday, 
<line: 31> February 7, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. (Central) in Courtroom 764, U.S. Courthouse, 801 Broadway, 

[ABANDON]
<line: 33> 1 The remaining Defendants were dismissed without prejudice under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m).  
<line: 34> See Docket Nos. 11 and 12.  Plaintiffs shall therefore discontinue including those Defendants in 
<line: 35> case captions.

<line: 2> Nashville, Tennessee.  If this date and time are not convenient for the parties, they must contact

<line: 4> obtain another mutually agreeable date and time available on the Magistrate Judge’s calendar, and 
<line: 5> must also file by that same date an appropriate motion to continue.  Noncompliance with this 
<line: 6> provision either by failing to appear for the scheduled initial case management conference 
<line: 7> or failing to timely request a continuance according to the instructions in this provision will

<line: 13> management conference, the parties shall file a joint proposed initial case management order, about 
<line: 14> which they have conferred, as directed in the original notice (Docket No. 6).  If, however, 
<line: 15> Defendant has not by that time participated in this case as directed by this Order, it is not necessary 
<line: 16> for Plaintiff to refile a proposed initial case management order.  Any joint proposed initial case 
<line: 17> management order must also be emailed in Word format to Ms. Jeanne Cox, Courtroom Deputy, 
<line: 18> at Jeanne_W_Cox@tnmd.uscourts.gov. 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> 3. 
<line: 21> By no later than January 31, 2018, Defendant Jean Perez must either (i) obtain 
<line: 22> counsel, who shall by that date enter a notice of appearance in accordance with local rules, or 
<line: 23> (ii) notify the Court of her intention to proceed pro se.  Failure to comply with this provision 
<line: 24> will result in a recommendation to the District Judge for entry of default against Defendant 
<line: 25> Perez. 

[TEXT]
<line: 27> 4. 
<line: 28> By no later than January 31, 2018, Defendant Jean Perez must also show cause
