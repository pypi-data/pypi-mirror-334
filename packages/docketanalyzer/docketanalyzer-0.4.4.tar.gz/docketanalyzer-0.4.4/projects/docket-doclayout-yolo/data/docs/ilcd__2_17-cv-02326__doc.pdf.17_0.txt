[TEXT]
<line: 4> 8. Defendant, Papa John’s International, Inc., is a Delaware corporation, and through its 
<line: 5> subsidiary, Papa John’s USA, Inc., a Kentucky corporation, (collectively “Papa John’s”), at 
<line: 6> all times material to this action possessed and continues to possess their principal place of 
<line: 7> business in Kentucky. Papa John’s operates under a franchise business model. Specifically, 
<line: 8> a number of Papa John’s restaurants are not actually owned by Papa John’s, the franchisor, 
<line: 9> but by independent franchisees in the United States and Canada. Papa John’s possesses 
<line: 10> franchisees and regularly conducts business in Champaign County, Illinois.  

[TEXT]
<line: 12> 9. Defendant, HH Enterprises, Inc., (“HH Enterprises”), at all times material to this action, was 
<line: 13> an Illinois Corporation registered in Champaign County, Illinois. HH Enterprises is a Papa 
<line: 14> John’s franchisee and operates Papa John’s #1831 which is a Papa John’s store (“Store”) 
<line: 15> located at 225 East Congress Avenue, Rantoul, Illinois. At all times therein, the owner of HH 
<line: 16> Enterprises was Mr. Hakan Hatipoglu (“Hatipoglu”). 

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 10. On November 6, 2007, Defendants Papa John’s and HH Enterprises, Inc. entered into a 
<line: 19> franchise agreement. Pursuant to the franchise agreement, Papa John’s (the “franchisor”) 
<line: 20> ensured that HH Enterprises, Inc. (the “franchisee”) would operate the restaurant in strict 
<line: 21> compliance with Papa John’s’ standards and policies for employees, provide operational 
<line: 22> training for employees as needed, and provide policy and procedure statements or other 
<line: 23> written notice of specifications, standards and procedures as required by the franchisor, Papa 
<line: 24> John’s.  

[TEXT]
<line: 26> 11. Papa John’s is a joint employer with its franchisees because Papa John’s exercises indirect 
<line: 27> control over working conditions and/or reserves the authority to do so through its right to 
<line: 28> control operations at all of its restaurants via franchise agreements, business manuals, and 
<line: 29> other operating documents.

<line: 4> STATEMENT OF FACTS 

[TEXT]
<line: 6> 12. At all relevant times therein, Plaintiff, Jessica A. Williams, was a protected party under the 
<line: 7> Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e(k), and the Illinois Human Rights Act, 
<line: 8> 775 ILCS 5/2-102(I).  

[TEXT]
<line: 10> 13. Plaintiff was hired by the Defendant, HH Enterprises, as a Manager in Rantoul, Illinois in 
<line: 11> May 2016. 

[TEXT]
<line: 13> 14. At all times relevant herein, Plaintiff performed her job duties in a satisfactory manner 
<line: 14> consistent with Papa John’s and HH Enterprise’s reasonable expectations. 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> 15. In July of 2016, Plaintiff advised the General Manager of the Store, Jessica Babcock 
<line: 17> (“Babcock” or “General Manager”), that Plaintiff had become pregnant and would need to 
<line: 18> take unpaid maternity leave later in the year. Babcock stated that Plaintiff’s pregnancy was 
<line: 19> “bullshit,” and that Plaintiff should have let the Defendants know that Plaintiff was pregnant 
<line: 20> when she was hired. Babcock also stated that she would need to tell the owner of HH 
<line: 21> Enterprises, Hakam Hatipoglu, about Plaintiff’s pregnancy, and stated ominously that 
<line: 22> Hatipoglu would “not be happy” with Plaintiff. 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> 16. While working alone at the Store on September 5, 2016, the Plaintiff began experiencing 
<line: 25> abdominal cramping and pain. Plaintiff notified the General Manager that she thought she 
<line: 26> might be having contractions and needed to go to the hospital to seek medical care. The 
<line: 27> General Manager told the Plaintiff that “she should have been smart enough to know if she 
<line: 28> was having contractions” and did not arrive at the Store to relieve Plaintiff for over two hours. 

[TEXT]
<line: 30> 17. Plaintiff gave birth to her child via cesarean section on September 15, 2017. Plaintiff’s 
<line: 31> physician recommended that Plaintiff take six (6) weeks off of work for maternity leave. See 
<line: 32> Plaintiff’s Exhibit E, attached hereto.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 18. During the time Plaintiff was on medical leave, Defendants, by and through their agents, 
<line: 5> contacted Plaintiff and told her that she would need to report to work under threat of 
<line: 6> termination if Plaintiff refused to comply. See Plaintiff’s Exhibit F, attached hereto. 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> 19. When Plaintiff returned to the Store following her maternity leave, she was demoted from 
<line: 9> her position as Manager and was given fewer hours during the week. See Plaintiff’s Exhibit 
<line: 10> G, attached hereto. Plaintiff’s hourly wage was also reduced as a result of her demotion. 

[TEXT]
<line: 12> 20. As a result of complications from her pregnancy, Plaintiff occasionally needed to use the 
<line: 13> restroom during her shift at the Store. When Plaintiff advised the General Manager that she 
<line: 14> needed to use the restroom, Plaintiff was told that she would need to clock out in order to do 
<line: 15> so. 

[TEXT]
<line: 17> 21. When the Plaintiff advised the General Manager of the problems Plaintiff was experiencing 
<line: 18> regarding hours, wages, and treatment by other employees, the General Manager became 
<line: 19> verbally abusive to the Plaintiff in front of Mr. Hatipoglu. The General Manager stated to the 
<line: 20> Plaintiff that she had “better watch herself” because the General Manager “did not need a 
<line: 21> reason” to terminate the Plaintiff. After the encounter with the General Manager, Mr. 
<line: 22> Hatipoglu stated to the Plaintiff that he “did not want any drama” and the Plaintiff needed to 
<line: 23> “think about if she really wanted her job or not.” See Plaintiff’s Exhibit H, attached hereto. 

[TEXT]
<line: 25> 22. On November 4, 2016, Plaintiff retained Langacker Law to represent her in regard to her 
<line: 26> employment issues with the Defendants. 

[TEXT]
<line: 28> 23. On November 9, 2016, Langacker Law sent a request for Plaintiff’s personnel records 
<line: 29> pursuant to the Illinois Personnel Record Review Act (820 ILCS Section 40) to the Store 
<line: 30> location #1831 addressed to Mr. Hatipoglu. See Plaintiff’s Exhibit I, attached hereto.

<line: 9> EEOC and IDHR, Charge No. 2017SF1148, alleging that she had been discriminated against 
<line: 10> by the Defendants as a result of her pregnancy. The Charge was mailed to the Defendants on 
<line: 11> November 30, 2016. Refer to Exhibit A, previously incorporated herein. 

[TEXT]
<line: 13> 26. On December 3, 2016, Plaintiff was reprimanded for allegedly being late because she had 
<line: 14> a flat tire. Plaintiff pointed out that she had only began receiving written discipline after her 
<line: 15> attorney had contacted the Store and requested her employment file. Upon referencing this 
<line: 16> fact in the write up, the Mr. Hatipoglu refused to sign the reprimand. See Exhibit K, attached 
<line: 17> hereto. 

[TEXT]
<line: 19> 27. On December 5, 2016, Plaintiff’s hours were again reduced. When Plaintiff asked Mr. 
<line: 20> Hatipoglu why her hours had been reduced, he stated, “if [Plaintiff] tried to hurt his family 
<line: 21> then he would return the favor,” in reference to Plaintiff’s charge of discrimination filed with 
<line: 22> the IDHR and EEOC on November 28, 2016. See Plaintiff’s Exhibit L, attached hereto. 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> 28. On February 27, 2017, Plaintiff was again reprimanded after she was forced to take time 
<line: 25> off of work for an emergency dental procedure. As a result of the dental procedure, Plaintiff 
<line: 26> was placed on medical leave and released back to work on March 10, 2017. See Plaintiff’s
