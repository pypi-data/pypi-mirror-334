[TITLE]
<line: 23> DENIAL OF ENTRY OF DEFAULT  

[TEXT]
<line: 25> Pending is Plaintiffs’ Motion for Default Judgment against Defendant (Docket Entry No. 24).  
<line: 26> The motion is denied for the following reasons: 

[TEXT]
<line: 28> 1. 
<line: 29> The grant of a default judgment is a two-part process and no default judgment may be 
<line: 30> granted pursuant to FRCP 55(b) until default has been entered pursuant to FRCP 55(a).  U.S. v. 
<line: 31> $22,050.00 U.S. Currency, 2008 WL 4093066 at page 3 (M.D. Tenn. Aug. 26, 2008); Ramada 
<line: 32> Franchise Systems, Inc. v. Baroda Enterprises, LLC, 220 F.R.D. 303, 305 (N.D. Ohio 2004).  
<line: 33> Plaintiffs have not requested entry of default. 

[TEXT]
<line: 35> 2. 
<line: 36> Plaintiffs have not provided an affidavit of military service as required by the 
<line: 37> Servicemembers Civil Relief Act of 2003 (50 App. U.S.C. 501 et seq.). The Servicemembers Civil 
<line: 38> Relief Act requires that affidavits be submitted that “state whether or not the Defendant is in military 
<line: 39> service and showing facts necessary to support the affidavit”.  Information on the military status of an 
<line: 40> individual can be obtained at the Department of Defense website at https://scra.dmdc.osd.mil/scra/.  
<line: 41> A sworn statement or declaration providing facts demonstrating that the defendant is not in the 
<line: 42> military service also could be accepted.  Factors such as the age of Defendant if beyond the age for 
<line: 43> service or full-time employment in another position can be considered.

<line: 2> 3. 
<line: 3> Service has not been confirmed to the Clerk’s satisfaction.  A return of service was 
<line: 4> filed (Docket Entry No. 8), but the signature of the individual signing the certified mail return receipt 
<line: 5> is illegible.  No printed name is provided in Section B of the receipt.  In addition, it is unclear to the 
<line: 6> Clerk that the address used is an appropriate one.  If Plaintiffs file a request for entry of default as 
<line: 7> noted above, an affidavit should be included that identifies the address used and its connection to 
<line: 8> Defendant.  Plaintiffs should also, to the extent possible, establish that the signer of the return receipt 
<line: 9> is an authorized agent to receive process for Defendant.  In addition, the certificate of service 
<line: 10> attached to the motion for default judgment does not include the address at which the Defendant was 
<line: 11> served and is therefore defective. 

[TEXT]
<line: 13> 4. 
<line: 14> As noted by the Court (Docket Entry No. 25), the motion seeks damages that are not 
<line: 15> of a sum certain and no affidavit as to damages has been included.   Following the entry of default, if 
<line: 16> sought by Plaintiffs, a motion for default judgment seeking a hearing on damages should be filed to 
<line: 17> determine if all requested relief is awardable.   

[TEXT]
<line: 19> For the foregoing reasons, the motion is denied.
