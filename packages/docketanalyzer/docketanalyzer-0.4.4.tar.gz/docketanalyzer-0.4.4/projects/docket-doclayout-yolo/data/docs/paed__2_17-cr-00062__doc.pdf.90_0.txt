<line: 19> MEMORANDUM 

[TEXT]
<line: 21> This is a prosecution for multiple bank robberies, in which Defendant Raheem Pleasant 
<line: 22> moves to suppress historical cell-site location information (CSLI) associated with his cellular 
<line: 23> telephone.  The Government obtained the CSLI, without a warrant, through an order issued 
<line: 24> pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c), a provision of the Stored Communications Act, based on a 
<line: 25> showing that the records were “relevant and material” to an ongoing criminal investigation.  In 
<line: 26> moving to suppress, Defendant correctly argues that under the Supreme Court’s recent decision 
<line: 27> in Carpenter v. United States, ____ U.S. ____, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018), the CSLI was obtained 
<line: 28> by the Government in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  Defendant is also correct that 
<line: 29> Carpenter retroactively applies to this case.  That does not end the inquiry, because the 
<line: 30> Government is equally correct that there is a good faith exception to application of the 
<line: 31> exclusionary rule.  Having considered the parties’ submissions, I am persuaded that the 
<line: 32> government agents who accessed this information did so in good faith reliance on a federal 
<line: 33> statute and circuit court precedent that was controlling at the time.  Because application of the 
<line: 34> exclusionary rule here would not serve the purpose of deterring unlawful conduct by law 
<line: 35> enforcement, Defendant’s Motion to Suppress will be denied.

[TEXT]
<line: 2> In January 2017, Magistrate Judge Hart issued an order authorizing the Government to 
<line: 3> access Defendant’s CSLI pursuant to the Stored Communications Act.  18 U.S.C. § 2703(c) 
<line: 4> allows a governmental entity to obtain CSLI from a service provider by means of a court order if 
<line: 5> it “offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
<line: 6> the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, 
<line: 7> are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.”  Id. § 2703(d).  This statutory 
<line: 8> standard, however, “falls well short of the probable cause required for a warrant.”  Carpenter, 
<line: 9> 138 S. Ct. at 2221.  In Carpenter, the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of this 
<line: 10> provision under the Fourth Amendment and concluded that, in accessing CSLI from wireless 
<line: 11> carriers, the Government had “invaded” the defendant’s “reasonable expectation of privacy in 
<line: 12> the whole of his physical movements.”  Id. at 2219.  It therefore held that the Government must 
<line: 13> obtain a search warrant, supported by probable cause, before accessing a defendant’s CSLI from 
<line: 14> a service provider.  Id. at 2221.   

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Despite Carpenter, Defendant’s Motion lacks merit.  Under the exclusionary rule, as a 
<line: 17> general matter, the government may not introduce evidence in a criminal trial that was obtained 
<line: 18> in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  The exclusionary rule, however, is rooted in policy 
<line: 19> considerations:  it serves to enforce the Fourth Amendment by discouraging police misconduct.  
<line: 20> As the Supreme Court has recognized, the Fourth Amendment protects “[t]he right of the people 
<line: 21> to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and 
<line: 22> seizures,” but it has no provision “expressly precluding the use of evidence obtained in violation 
<line: 23> of its commands.”  Arizona v. Evans, 514 U.S. 1, 10 (1995).  Consequently, the exclusionary rule 
<line: 24> “is not an individual right and applies only where it ‘result[s] in appreciable deterrence.’”  
<line: 25> Herring v. United States, 555 U.S. 135, 141 (2009) (quoting United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 2 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> 909 (1984)) (internal quotations omitted).  Stated differently, it is a judicially imposed sanction 
<line: 3> applied when necessary to enforce the Constitution.  

[TEXT]
<line: 5> The critical question then becomes whether some deterrent purpose would be served by 
<line: 6> excluding the evidence in this case.  As the Supreme Court has observed, “when the police act 
<line: 7> with an objectively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful . . . , the deterrence 
<line: 8> rationale loses much of its force.”  Davis v. United States, 564 U.S. 229, 238 (2011) (citing 
<line: 9> United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984)) (citations and internal quotations omitted).  Under 
<line: 10> this “good faith” exception to the exclusionary rule, the Court has held that evidence obtained in 
<line: 11> violation of the Fourth Amendment may not be excluded, if, for example, an investigating officer 
<line: 12> relies on a facially valid warrant, conducts a search in “objectively reasonable reliance on 
<line: 13> binding precedent,” or acts pursuant to a statute that is not unconstitutional on its face.  See Leon, 
<line: 14> 468 U.S. at 920–21; Herring, 555 U.S. at 142 (summarizing cases where the Court has applied 
<line: 15> the good faith exception); Davis, 564 U.S. at 241 (“Evidence obtained during a search conducted 
<line: 16> in reasonable reliance on binding precedent is not subject to the exclusionary rule.”); see also 
<line: 17> Illinois v. Krull, 480 U.S. 340, 349 (1987). 

[TEXT]
<line: 19> I conclude that the agents in this case acted in good faith in accessing Defendant’s CSLI 
<line: 20> data.  First, the agents did not act on their own:  they appropriately sought a court order from 
<line: 21> Magistrate Judge Hart pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d) before accessing the CSLI data.  Second, 
<line: 22> the agents proceeded under a federal statute that had previously survived constitutional challenge 
<line: 23> in the Third Circuit.  In 2010, the Court of Appeals specifically upheld § 2703(d) in the face of a 
<line: 24> Fourth Amendment attack.  See In re Application of U.S. for an Order Directing a Provider of 
<line: 25> Elec. Commc’n Serv. to Disclose Records to Gov’t, 620 F.3d 304, 313 (3d Cir. 2010) (“[W]e

[TEXT]
<line: 2> hold that CSLI from cell phone calls is obtainable under a § 2703(d) order and that such an order 
<line: 3> does not require the traditional probable cause determination.”).   

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Considering the weight of authority supporting the constitutionality of § 2703(d), no 
<line: 6> serious argument can be made that the agents should have recognized the unconstitutionality of 
<line: 7> §2703(d) on their own.  Before Carpenter, no federal circuit had found it deficient.  See United 
<line: 8> States v. Thompson, 866 F.3d 1149 (10th Cir. 2017); United States v. Graham, 824 F.3d 421 (4th 
<line: 9> Cir. 2016); United States v. Carpenter, 819 F.3d 880 (6th Cir. 2016), cert. granted, 137 S. Ct. 
<line: 10> 2211 (2017), and rev’d and remanded, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018).  Furthermore, although two 
<line: 11> decisions from the Supreme Court, United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 400 (2012), and Riley v. 
<line: 12> California, ––– U.S. ––––, 134 S. Ct. 2473 (2014), could be said to have foreshadowed the 
<line: 13> holding in Carpenter, even after their issuance the Third Circuit continued to uphold § 2703(d) 
<line: 14> as constitutional, United States v. Stimler, 864 F.3d 253 (3d Cir. 2017), despite Judge Restrepo’s   
<line: 15> prescient argument to the contrary.  864 F.3d at 275.  In that regard, it bears mention that 
<line: 16> Carpenter itself was decided by a vote of five to four. 

[TEXT]
<line: 18> In summary, the agents here proceeded by means of a court order issued under a federal 
<line: 19> statute that had repeatedly withstood Fourth Amendment scrutiny.  By any measure, they 
<line: 20> proceeded in good faith under then existing law, with the result that no purpose would be served 
<line: 21> by suppression.
