[TITLE]
<line: 4> Amended Complaint Attachment
<line: 5> In response to Item #4 National Origin issue in Defendant's Motion.

[TEXT]
<line: 7> The Plaintiff affirms that as a Moorish American he is indigenous to the Land of lllinois, Indiana, Western
<line: 8> Michigan and Great Lakes Region of the United States (formally Al-Moroccan Empire). The Plaintiff
<line: 9> affirms that this is a issue of significance considering that Saint Gobain (Defendant) which was founded
<line: 10> by the "French Crown" was complicit in receiving goods, services, monies and property from the Plaintiff's.
<line: 11> ancestry. The Plaintiff (Ruffin El) aiso affirms he nor his ancestors were "restored" and did not receive
<line: 12> compensation from Saint Gobain (Defendant). The Plaintiff also affirms that the French agents that
<line: 13> established St. Gobain were complicit in destroying historical records since they were beneficiaries of the
<line: 14> Northwest Ordinance of 1787, Treaty of Paris and other atrocities against the Indigenous people of
<line: 15> Indiana, Illinois and "Fort St Joseph" (Present Day St. Joseph, Michigan). The Plaintiff also affirms that
<line: 16> under Article 6 of the US Constitution he is a protected class and shall be treated as such. The Plaintiff
<line: 17> affirms that the surname of "RUFFIN" was very familiar with the French Crown agents who established
<line: 18> the Saint Gobain Corporation. The Plaintiff affirms that the Nomadic Choctaw (Choc-Tau) Warriors who
<line: 19> navigated, translated, fought wars on behalf of the French Agents were never restored or compensated.
<line: 20> The Plaintiff affirms that it was his Ancestors (called RUFFIN's and Choctaw under the color of LAw) who.
<line: 21> ensured the success of the French Crown as well as other European Crown Agents. The Plaintiff affirms
<line: 22> that he is descended and/or related to the Great Indian Chiefs named "General Pushmataha" and
<line: 23> "General Hummingbird". The Plaintiff affirms that as a Moorish American he is part and parcel of the US
<line: 24> Government according to the Moorish American By-Laws and Constitution. The Plaintiff affirms that he
<line: 25> and his ancestry have suffered for 600 years (6 Days) under the various European Agents and that all
<line: 26> these affirmations are in accord with Civil Law, Natural Law and most importantly "Ecclesiastical" LA of
<line: 27> the Universal Creator. The Plaintiff affirms to the high court, officers and all agents of these atrocities and
<line: 28> violations that this time and history can be "likened" to the ecclesiastical Lazarus. These affirmations of
<line: 29> the Plaintiff (Ruffin-El) are three dimensional in relevance Ecclesiastic, Civil and Natural and therefore the.
<line: 30> Plaintiff's motion is of Great Importance. The Plaintiff affirms that these facts are true and in accord with
<line: 31> ALL LAW who is also known as ALLAH. The Plaintiff (Ruffin-El) seeks immediate reward and relief.
<line: 32> regarding this Matter. May ALLAH (All Law) "reward' each Officer according to his works regarding this
<line: 33> serious matter.

<line: 9> Samuel 7 Ruffin Family

[TEXT]
<line: 11> Born: 14 June 1814 Greene Co, NC
<line: 12> Died: 7 Jan 1885 Choctaw Co AL
<line: 13> Parents: Henry John Gray and Mary Tartt
<line: 14> Married:24 Nov 1875  Ann Haywood (daughter of US Sen. William H. Haywood.

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Samuel attended the University of North Carolina before moving to Alabama. By 1860 Samuel Ruffin had
<line: 17> purchased 7,200 acres of land in the Pushmataha area of Choctaw County, AL. This land was south of
<line: 18> Highway 10, across from Gilfield Church toward Riderwood and West of Cyril.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> In 1850 he owned 86 slaves and real estate valued at $6,500. By 1860 there were 148 and real estate of
<line: 21> $50,000 and personal property of $200,000, thus becoming the largest slave owner in the county..

[TEXT]
<line: 23> He remained unmarried until late in life, and spent his summers in the family home in North Carolina, and
<line: 24> the winters at his plantation in Choctaw County or at his cabin at the fashionable resort of Bladon Springs.
<line: 25> He often visted the Sydney Trotter Prince family who lived in Mount Sterling, but who later moved to
<line: 26> Mobile. Mr. Ruffin stayed in Mobile with this family often as he traveled to his Choctaw County home

[TEXT]
<line: 28> During the Civil War, he equipped and sent to the field at his own expense the Choctaw Ruffin.
<line: 29> Dragoons, the first cavalry company from Alabama. This unit was so well dressed and drilled that it.
<line: 30> earned a high reputation under the command of Frank Young Gaines. The Company served in Gen.
<line: 31> Wheeler's Division.

[TEXT]
<line: 33> He was known as "The Soldier's Friend" and gave generously of his personal wealth "to the maintenance
<line: 34> of the wives and children of confederate soldiers". There were regular collections of food made in those
<line: 35> days, and Col Ruffin was a constant contribuotor to those in his own and other counties..

[TEXT]
<line: 37> It is believed that the "Col." was an honorary title perhpas bestowed on him for his tremendous expense
<line: 38> in outfitting the Ruffin Dragoons. By 1870 his real estate had dropped to only $20,000; and his personal.
<line: 39> fortune had fallen from $200,000 to $8,000. After the war, Ruffin sold much of his land around Riderwood
<line: 40> to his former slaves.

[TEXT]
<line: 42> In 1875 at the age of 61, Ruffin married a daughter of the distinguished Senator Haywood of North
<line: 43> Carolina. The marriage ended ten years later with Ruffin's death. There were no children from this union.

[TEXT]
<line: 45> His nephew, Samuel Ruffin (son of his brother, William Haywood, and wife Agnes Chadwick Ruffin) also
<line: 46> lived in Choctaw County with his wife Blanche Forster. Baptism records indicate the family worshipped in
<line: 47> Calvary Church, Episcopal.

[TEXT]
<line: 49> In January of 1885, Col. Ruffin, on his way to his plantation in Choctaw County, was stricken with a heart
<line: 50> attack at the home of his friend, Sydney Trotter Prince in Toulminville. The Princes immediately
<line: 51> telegraphed Mrs. Ruffin, who arrived in time to be at the bedsie of her dying husband. She accompanied
<line: 52> the body to North Carolina for burial in Louisburg, Franktin County, in the Ruffin family Cemetery. Ruffin's
<line: 53> entire estate was left to his wife, who sold most of it.
