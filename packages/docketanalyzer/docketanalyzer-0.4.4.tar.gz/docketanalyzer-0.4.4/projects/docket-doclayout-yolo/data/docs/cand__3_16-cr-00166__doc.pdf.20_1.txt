<line: 36> The United States of America, through its attorneys, Andrew M. Luger, United 
<line: 37> States Attorney for the District of Minnesota, and Assistant United States Attorneys John 
<line: 38> Docherty, Andrew R. Winter, and Julie E. Allyn, respectfully submits its Final Report on 
<line: 39> national terrorism sentencings. Several earlier iterations of this Report have been filed by 
<line: 40> the government.  This Final Report includes all sentencings in material support cases found 
<line: 41> by the government through the date of this pleading, October 31, 2016.  The final 
<line: 42> sentencing included is that of Muhanad Badawi, sentenced on October 19, 2016, following 
<line: 43> trial in the Central District of California.  Other sentencings which are new since the last 
<line: 44> report are two co-defendants in the Northern District of Illinois, Hasan Edmonds and Jonas 
<line: 45> Edmonds, who were convicted on pleas of guilty.

<line: 47> The government is aware of no cases pending sentencing in the near future, but will, 
<line: 48> of course, continue to look for sentencings that may occur between now and the time of

<line: 4> sentencing in these cases.  Because no additional sentencings are anticipated between now 
<line: 5> and November 14, 2016, however, the government is captioning this report its “final” 
<line: 6> report. 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> This report summarizes sentencing data from federal cases around the country in 
<line: 9> which one or more defendants have been convicted of providing material support to a 
<line: 10> designated foreign terrorist organization.  This Final Report provides information about all 
<line: 11> cases relating to the provision of material support, regardless of the count of conviction or 
<line: 12> the identity of the foreign terrorist organization.  

[TEXT]
<line: 14> There is one exception to this attempt at being comprehensive; cases in which the 
<line: 15> sole count of conviction is a false statements charge, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001, have 
<line: 16> not been included.  That is because those cases can cover offender behavior that is far 
<line: 17> removed from the provision of material support to terrorists, and the inclusion of false 
<line: 18> statements convictions would result in this Final Report comparing dissimilar cases. 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> One-paragraph factual summaries of each case are set forth below.  The facts were 
<line: 21> taken from various sources, including press releases issued by the relevant United States 
<line: 22> Attorney’s Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> The chart that follows the factual summary paragraphs collects for the reader the 
<line: 25> key items of information about each case, including the defendant’s name; the federal 
<line: 26> judicial district in which the defendant was sentenced; the district court file number, so that 
<line: 27> readers who are so inclined can further research the case using PACER; the date of 
<line: 28> sentencing; the aggregate, pronounced, custodial sentence; the lead statute of conviction; 
<line: 29> whether the defendant’s conviction resulted from a negotiated guilty plea or a jury verdict

<line: 4> following trial; and the designated foreign terrorist organization to which the defendant 
<line: 5> provided material support. 

[TEXT]
<line: 7> As in earlier reports in this series, sentencing data was taken from district court 
<line: 8> judgment and commitment orders filed on PACER. 

[TEXT]
<line: 10> Cases are arranged chronologically by date of sentencing, oldest sentencing first.  
<line: 11> The oldest sentence in this report is that of defendant Sinh Nguyen, who was sentenced in 
<line: 12> the Central District of California on June 30, 2014.  The most recent sentencing is that of 
<line: 13> Muhanad Badawi, also sentenced in the Central District of California, on October 19, 2016.   

[TEXT]
<line: 15> The sentences of 26 defendants are summarized below.  There are several features 
<line: 16> of these cases worth noting: 

[TEXT]
<line: 18> - Four of these defendants, co-defendants Sohiel Kabir and Ralph Deleon, plus 
<line: 19> co-defendants Nader Elhuzayel and Muhanad Badawi, were convicted following 
<line: 20> trial.  The other twenty-two defendants all pled guilty. 
<line: 21> - Only one defendant, Ralph Deleon, was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 956.  
<line: 22> In some of the other cases in this Report, a defendant was convicted of violating 
<line: 23> 18 U.S.C. § 2339A, with the predicate offense for the 18 U.S.C. § 2339A 
<line: 24> conviction being an 18 U.S.C. § 956 conspiracy.  Because these cases only 
<line: 25> referred to 18 U.S.C. § 956, but did not actually charge 18 U.S.C. § 956, they 
<line: 26> have not been counted as 18 U.S.C. § 956 sentences. An example of how this 
<line: 27> fact pattern comes about is presented in the Indictment in United States v. 
<line: 28> Mahamud Said Omar, Criminal No. 09-242 (MJD/SRN), Docket No. 1.  In that 
<line: 29> case, the charging language for the counts alleging a violation of 18 U.S.C.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> § 2339A read as follows: “[Defendant]  did knowingly and intentionally 
<line: 5> conspire with others to provide material support and resources, knowing and 
<line: 6> intending that the material support and resources were to be used in preparation 
<line: 7> for and in carrying out a violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 956 
<line: 8> (conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim, or injure persons in a foreign country), all in 
<line: 9> violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 2339A(a).”  (Emphasis added.)  
<line: 10> However, despite being mentioned in the indictment’s charging language, such 
<line: 11> cases do not constitute a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 956, and so are not included in 
<line: 12> this Final Report as 18 U.S.C. § 956 cases, although they may be included in this 
<line: 13> Final Report for other reasons. 

[TEXT]
<line: 15> - Of the 26 defendants, 20 were convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 2339B, either 
<line: 16> standing alone, or in conjunction with other convictions.  Of these 20, 14 were 
<line: 17> sentenced to 18 U.S.C. § 2339B’s statutory maximum of fifteen years in prison.  
<line: 18> (The statutory maximum has since been increased to twenty years, but none of 
<line: 19> the defendants in this Final Report committed their crimes recently enough to be 
<line: 20> exposed to the increased statutory maximum penalty.)  

[TEXT]
<line: 22> - In several of these cases, the defendant was convicted of more than one crime.  
<line: 23> Those cases are United States v. Shelton Bell (number three below); United 
<line: 24> States v. Sohiel Kabir and Ralph DeLeon (number five below); United States v. 
<line: 25> Donald Ray Morgan (number six below); United States v. Agron Hasbajrami 
<line: 26> (number nine below); United States v. Ming Quang Pham (number 12 below);

<line: 6> In all of these cases but one (Dandach), the sentencing judge imposed a sentence

<line: 8> conviction.

<line: 10> THE CASES 

[TEXT]
<line: 12> 1. 
<line: 13> United States v. Sinh Vinh Ngo Nguyen, Central District of California, June 
<line: 14> 30, 2014.  Defendant Nguyen traveled to Syria and fought with anti-Assad forces for four 
<line: 15> months.  Upon his return to the United States he expressed a desire to “return to jihad” 
<line: 16> because that “was what he was born to do.”  After giving a man he thought was an al Qaeda 
<line: 17> recruiter (but who was in reality working for the FBI) a photograph of himself and a U.S. 
<line: 18> passport application containing false information, Nguyen was arrested.  Defendant 
<line: 19> Nguyen was sentenced by Judge John F. Walter to 13 years in prison. 

[TEXT]
<line: 21> 2. 
<line: 22> United States v. Gufran Mohammed, Southern District of Florida, December 
<line: 23> 17, 2014.  Defendant Mohammed wired funds to al Qaeda in Iraq, the al-Nusrah Front, and 
<line: 24> al Shabaab.  Defendant Mohammed also agreed to recruit people to travel overseas and 
<line: 25> join these designated foreign terrorist organizations.  Defendant Mohammed was sentenced 
<line: 26> by Judge Ursula Ungaro to 15 years in prison, the statutory maximum for a violation of 18 
<line: 27> U.S.C. § 2339B.  United States v. Mohammed Hussain Said is the companion case to this 
<line: 28> one (see number ten below).

<line: 4> following a training regimen of their own devising for three months, Bell and the juvenile 
<line: 5> traveled from New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport to Poland.  They then 
<line: 6> flew from Poland to Israel.  Israeli officials arrested the pair and sent them back to Poland.  
<line: 7> The two then flew to Jordan, where they were again arrested, and this time returned to the 
<line: 8> United States.  Bell entered guilty pleas to two 18 U.S.C. § 2339B counts, one of them 
<line: 9> attempt, and one of them conspiracy.  Judge Timothy Corrigan sentenced Bell to twenty 
<line: 10> years in prison.  Judge Corrigan imposed the fifteen-year statutory maximum for a violation 
<line: 11> of 18 U.S.C. § 2339B on the 18 U.S.C. § 2339B conspiracy count, and then imposed a 
<line: 12> sentence of five years’ imprisonment, to be served consecutively, on the attempt count.  
<line: 13> Judge Corrigan also filed a 41-page memorandum explaining his sentence.

<line: 15> 4. 
<line: 16> United States v. Shannon Conley, District of Colorado, January 23, 2015.  
<line: 17> Defendant Conley met an ISIL recruiter online.  In an effort to prepare herself to join, and 
<line: 18> fight for, ISIL, defendant Conley joined a U.S. Army-sponsored Explorer scout group, 
<line: 19> obtained first aid training, and took firearms training.  FBI agents met with defendant 
<line: 20> Conley multiple times and tried to talk her out of trying to travel to Syria.  Defendant 
<line: 21> Conley was not persuaded, and was arrested at the Denver airport as she tried to board a 
<line: 22> flight to Turkey.  Judge Raymond P. Moore sentenced Conley to 48 months in federal 
<line: 23> prison.

<line: 5> the press, the defendants conspired to travel to Afghanistan and kill U.S. troops there.  

[TEXT]
<line: 7> As to Kabir individually, the jury found him guilty of conspiracy to provide material 
<line: 8> support to terrorists, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339A; conspiracy to provide material 
<line: 9> support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339B; 
<line: 10> conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; and conspiracy to kill officers and employees 
<line: 11> of the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1117. 

[TEXT]
<line: 13> As to Deleon individually, the jury found him guilty of conspiring to provide 
<line: 14> material support to terrorists, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339A; conspiracy to kill, kidnap, 
<line: 15> and maim persons in a foreign country, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 956; and conspiracy to 
<line: 16> kill officers and employees of the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C.§ 1117.  Judge 
<line: 17> Virginia Phillips sentenced both defendants to 25 years’ imprisonment.  In the case of 
<line: 18> DeLeon, this sentence was composed of a 180-month sentence on DeLeon’s 18 
<line: 19> U.S.C.§ 2339A conviction (the statutory maximum); and 300 months in prison on each of 
<line: 20> the two conspiracy to murder charges.  All sentences were ordered to be served 
<line: 21> concurrently. 

[TEXT]
<line: 23> Defendant Kabir was sentenced to 180 months, the statutory maximum, on each of 
<line: 24> his material support convictions; 60 months, also the statutory maximum, on his conviction 
<line: 25> of 18 U.S.C. § 371; and 300 months for his conviction of conspiracy to kill officers and 
<line: 26> employees of the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1117.  All sentences were again 
<line: 27> ordered to be served concurrently.

<line: 5> United States v. Donald Ray Morgan, May 13, 2015, Middle District of 
<line: 6> North Carolina.  Defendant Morgan traveled to Lebanon, and from there attempted to enter 
<line: 7> Syria to join, and fight for, ISIL.  Upon his return to the United States, he was arrested at 
<line: 8> Kennedy Airport on a warrant for possession of a firearm by a felon.  Defendant Morgan 
<line: 9> was sentenced to a total of 243 months of imprisonment by Judge Thomas D. Schroeder.  
<line: 10> 180 months, or fifteen years, of Morgan’s sentence was allocated to Morgan’s conviction 
<line: 11> of violating 18 U.S.C. § 2339B. This is the statutory maximum for a violation of 18 U.S.C. 
<line: 12> § 2339B.  The balance of Morgan’s sentence, 63 months, was allocated by Judge Schroeder 
<line: 13> to Morgan’s firearms conviction.

<line: 18> admitted at his change of plea hearing that in preparation, he applied for and acquired a 
<line: 19> U.S. passport, participated in physical fitness training, practiced military maneuvers, 
<line: 20> concealed his preparations, and bought an airline ticket for travel to Europe, which he 
<line: 21> believed would be the first leg of a trip to the Middle East.  Instead, he was arrested on the

<line: 7> procedural history.  Defendant Pham was arrested in the United Kingdom on June 29, 2012, 
<line: 8> and extradited to the United States in February of 2015.  Pham left his home in London to 
<line: 9> travel to Yemen in December 2010, where he planned an attack in the United Kingdom.  
<line: 10> While in Yemen he received military training, including training in bomb-making, from 
<line: 11> the designated terrorist organization al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (“AQAP”), and he

<line: 13> support to AQAP, conspiring to receive military training from AQAP, and using a machine 
<line: 14> gun in furtherance of crimes of violence.  He was sentenced by Judge Alison Nathan to a

<line: 20> defendant tried to recruit were working for the FBI.  Elfgeeh assisted the two in obtaining 
<line: 21> passports, and gave them advice about how to travel to Syria in a way that would avoid 
<line: 22> detection by law enforcement.  Elfgeeh also gave the individuals computer equipment 
<line: 23> which they were to take to Syria with them.  Elfgeeh also was in contact with anti-Assad 
<line: 24> fighters who were surrounded in the Syrian city of Homs by Assad regime troops.  Elfgeeh 
<line: 25> was able to put the commander of the surrounded soldiers in contact with ISIL leaders.  
<line: 26> After the commander of the surrounded soldiers pledged allegiance to ISIL, ISIL came to
