<line: 25> OPINION AND ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS 

[TEXT]
<line: 27> On April 4, 2016, Plaintiff S.M. Levine brought this derivative suit on behalf of the Dow 
<line: 28> Chemical Company (“Dow”). Compl., ECF No. 12. Levine named as Defendants Andrew N. 
<line: 29> Liveris, the President, CEO, and Chairman of Dow, as well as members of Dow’s Board of 
<line: 30> Directors and several high level officers for Dow. Id. at 5–17. He also names Dow as a nominal 
<line: 31> defendant. Id. at 5. In the Complaint, Levine asserts four claims: breach of fiduciary duty and 
<line: 32> waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, breach of duty of loyalty, and breach of duty of 
<line: 33> candor. Id. at 90–93. Levine’s claims arise out of the Board’s alleged wrongdoing in ignoring, 
<line: 34> condoning, and/or covering up systemic violations of federal antitrust laws by Dow and repeated 
<line: 35> misuse of Dow assets by Defendant Liveris. Id. at 2–4. On July 13, 2016, Defendants filed a 
<line: 36> motion to dismiss, ECF No. 18, alleging that Levine did not properly allege that he satisfied the 
<line: 37> “contemporaneous ownership” requirement of Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23.1(b)(1), that Levine did not 
<line: 38> adequately allege that his demands for the Board to bring suit directly were wrongfully refused, 
<line: 39> and that Levine’s complaint does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted. For the 
<line: 40> reasons stated below, Defendants’ motion to dismiss will be granted.

[TEXT]
<line: 6> When considering a motion to dismiss, a Court must accept the plaintiff’s adequately 
<line: 7> pleaded factual allegations as true. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Accordingly, the 
<line: 8> veracity of the factual allegations in Levine’s Complaint will be assumed. Plaintiff S. M. Levine 
<line: 9> is and has been a Dow shareholder at all times relevant to the litigation. Compl. at 5. The 
<line: 10> Complaint does not allege specific dates of ownership or the number of shares owned.  

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Defendant Andrew Liveris is the President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board of 
<line: 13> Directors for Dow. Id. at 6. Levine indicates that Liveris has “complete hegemony” over the 
<line: 14> company and Board and that he demands “fealty and loyalty to him personally” from all 
<line: 15> directors. Id. at 6–7. Defendant Jacqueline K. Barton has been a member of Dow’s Board since 
<line: 16> 1993. Id. at 7. She is also a Professor of Chemistry and Department Chair at the California

<line: 23> Dow’s Board since 2007. Id. He is also Chairman of the Marathon Oil Corporation. Id.

<line: 15> Besides the Director Defendants, Levine also named several Dow officers as Defendants. 
<line: 16> Defendant Charles J. Kalil is Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Dow. Id. 
<line: 17> Defendant Jeffrey L. Tate is Dow’s Chief Audit Executive. Id. Defendant Howard I. Ungerleider 
<line: 18> is Dow’s Chief Financial Officer. Id. at 17.  

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Levine asserts that each individual Defendant either initiated or participated in bad faith 
<line: 21> in conduct which breached their fiduciary duties. Id. at 18. First, he asserts that the Defendants 
<line: 22> deceived Dow shareholders regarding their efforts to ensure Dow’s compliance with federal 
<line: 23> antitrust laws and regarding their oversight of Dow’s defense in the Urethane Litigation. Id. See 
<line: 24> In re Urethane Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 1616, Civil Action No. 04-1616-JWL (D. Kansas). 
<line: 25> Levine contends that the suit would not have been brought in the first place if adequate internal 
<line: 26> compliance and antitrust compliance procedures had been in place, and that the action itself 
<line: 27> should have been settled far earlier in the process. Id. Second, he argues that the Defendants 
<line: 28> enabled and covered up Defendant Liveris’s misuse of Dow’s corporate assets. Id. at 19. In fact,

<line: 4> Levine indicates that Defendants defended and protected Liveris even after he was publically 
<line: 5> accused of misusing Dow assets for personal use in a wrongful termination suit brought by a 
<line: 6> former Dow employee. Id. See Wood v. Dow Chem. Co., 72 F. Supp. 3d 777 (E.D. Mich. 2014). 
<line: 7> Third, Levine argues that Defendants did not legitimately investigate the claims he has made and 
<line: 8> thus wrongfully rejected his demand that the Board bring suit on behalf of Dow. Id. at 19–20. He 
<line: 9> further argues that Defendants have wasted Dow’s assets by retaining biased counsel and 
<line: 10> conducting a sham investigation of Levine’s allegations. Id. at 20–21. Finally, he asserts that 
<line: 11> Defendants have violated their duty of candor by disseminating materially false and misleading 
<line: 12> press releases and financial statements and by not publically disclosing Liveris’s misuse of Dow 
<line: 13> assets and Dow’s financial exposure due to the Urethane Litigation. Id. at 21. 

[TITLE]
<line: 15> A. 

[TEXT]
<line: 17> The first of Levine’s two primary allegations that the Defendants breached their fiduciary 
<line: 18> duty to Dow focuses on the Defendants’ involvement with alleged price fixing in the urethane 
<line: 19> market. Dow is a major manufacturer of polyether polyol products, which are used to produce 
<line: 20> polyurethane polymers. Id. at 24. Levine contends that the nature of the polyether poloyol 
<line: 21> product market, in connection with similar markets, made it possible for Dow and certain co-
<line: 22> conspirators to engage in “anticompetitive collusion” and inflate “prices above competitive 
<line: 23> levels.” Id. at 25.  

[TEXT]
<line: 25> In 2006, Dow was named as a defendant in the Urethane Litigation class action suit, 
<line: 26> which alleged price fixing in the urethane market. Id. at 30. Dow defended itself for 
<line: 27> approximately 10 years. Id. On May 15, 2013, judgment was entered against Dow in an amount 
<line: 28> in excess of $1 billion. Id. After unsuccessfully appealing to the Federal Court of Appeals for the 
<line: 29> Tenth Circuit, Dow settled the case for $835 million. Id. at 30, 81. Dow also settled with

<line: 4> additional plaintiffs who had chosen to not be part of the class action for approximately $450 
<line: 5> million. Id. at 30. Dow expended tens of millions of dollars in litigation expenses. Id. All other 
<line: 6> defendants to the action settled long before Dow did and for significantly less. Id. at 31. Bayer 
<line: 7> Corp., BASF Corp., and Huntsman International LLC settled the case for $140 million. Id.  

[TEXT]
<line: 9> Levine contends that Defendants “abdicated their business judgment and gave virtually 
<line: 10> unfettered authority to the Company’s trial counsel.” Id. He also faults Defendants for not suing 
<line: 11> Dow’s trial counsel “in the wake of its obvious malpractice.” Id. As an example of that 
<line: 12> malpractice, Levine notes that the “firm had not properly preserved certain Daubert and related 
<line: 13> objections,” which resulted in the waiver of those potential arguments. Id. Because of that error, 
<line: 14> Defendant Kalil asked Dow’s trial counsel after the trial to end their representation of Dow. Id. 
<line: 15> Levine also faults Defendants for allowing “applicable statutes of limitations to run against those 
<line: 16> of its officers and directors responsible for the underlying violations of federal antitrust laws and 
<line: 17> those who acquiesced in it.” Id. at 32. Levine further asserts that, after being confronted with the 
<line: 18> claims and evidence against it, Dow and its counsel “‘stonewalled’ at the direction of Defendant 
<line: 19> Kalil instead of making reasonable efforts to resolve the claims pending.” Id. Because of that, 
<line: 20> Dow rejected settlement proposals which were significantly below the amount Dow eventually 
<line: 21> settled for. Id. Levine also asserts that Defendants wrongly covered up Dow’s “massive likely 
<line: 22> liability” and “falsely represented Dow’s exposure therein as not material.” Id. at 32–33.  

[TITLE]
<line: 24> B. 

[TEXT]
<line: 26> Second, Levine alleges that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties through their 
<line: 27> response to allegations and evidence that Defendant Liveris was misusing Dow assets. Id. at 33. 
<line: 28> As primary support for his allegations on this point, Levine refers to the complaint in Wood v. 
<line: 29> Dow Chem. Co., 72 F. Supp. 3d 777 (E.D. Mich. 2014). That suit was settled in February of

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 2015. See Wood v. Dow Chem. Co., No. 14-cv-13049, ECF No. 29. In the suit, Ms. Wood, a 
<line: 5> fraud investigator at Dow, alleged “that the Company’s money had financed vacations, sports 
<line: 6> junkets and other ‘perks’ for Defendant Liveris and his family.” Compl. at 34. Those alleged 
<line: 7> perks included “a safari; hundreds of thousands of dollars for Super Bowl parties; and $13,000 in 
<line: 8> uniforms for his son’s basketball team.” Id. Levine also alleges that Dow’s internal auditors 
<line: 9> conducted a series of investigations from 2008 to 2013 which revealed potential improprieties in 
<line: 10> Defendant Liveris’s spending. Id. Ms. Wood was fired after alerting her supervisors of the 
<line: 11> apparent wrongdoing. Id. at 35–36. Levine alleges that Defendant Kalil encouraged Dow’s 
<line: 12> internal auditors to ignore Liveris’s questioned expenses after the allegations of wrongdoing 
<line: 13> arose. Id. at 37. 

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Levine faults Defendants for “using Dow’s funds to silence Ms. Wood” by settling the 
<line: 16> case despite the legitimacy of Ms. Wood’s claims. Id. at 36. He also protests that Defendants 
<line: 17> took “no steps to thoroughly investigate [Liveris’s] wrongful conduct or to require an accounting 
<line: 18> by an independent auditor so that Dow could have an independent determination of the extent of 
<line: 19> such wrongdoing so that Dow can be fully repaid.” Id. Levine acknowledges that Liveris 
<line: 20> reimbursed Dow $719,923 for personal expenses charged to the company between 2007 and 
<line: 21> 2010, but Levine believes that Liveris owes far more to Dow. Id. He also argues that Defendants 
<line: 22> have breached their fiduciary duty to Dow by giving Liveris a “very generous ‘golden parachute’ 
<line: 23> contract” which entitled Liveris to “approximately $53 million in cash, stock, and tax 
<line: 24> reimbursement payments.” Id. at 39. Although the Complaint does not specifically identify the 
<line: 25> event this payment is predicated on, it appears that the compensation will occur after Liveris’s 
<line: 26> retirement, which is itself predicated on completion of a proposed merger between Dow and 
<line: 27> DuPont. See id.

<line: 4> Levine further asserts that Defendants breached their duty of candor by not conducting an 
<line: 5> “independent accounting or public disclosure of the full extent of [Liveris’s misuse] of Dow’s 
<line: 6> assets.” Id. at 37.   Specifically, Levine asserts that Dow’s proxy statements “misrepresented 
<line: 7> Dow’s true state of affairs, particularly with regard to Defendant Liveris’ compensation and the 
<line: 8> ineffectiveness of the Company’s financial controls.” Id. at 38. He points to discrepancies 
<line: 9> between Dow’s 2011 proxy statement and the testimony of Mr. Doug Anderson, Dow’s former 
<line: 10> Chief Internal Auditor. Id. at 39. Mr. Anderson testified that the proxy statement wrongly 
<line: 11> portrayed Dow’s investigation into and findings regarding Liveris’s spending habits as more 
<line: 12> routine and less serious than it actually was. Id.

<line: 14> C. 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Levine next alleges, in general terms, that the Defendants individually and collectively 
<line: 17> breached their fiduciary duties to Dow. Id. at 40. He asserts that Defendants had control, access, 
<line: 18> and authority sufficient to make them aware of the wrongdoing occurring within Dow. Id. at 42–
<line: 19> 43. He also contends that Defendants had a duty to “exercise reasonable and prudent supervision 
<line: 20> over the management, policies, practices and controls of the business and financial affairs of the 
<line: 21> Company.” Id. at 43. He particularly asserts that the Defendants violated Dow’s Code of 
<line: 22> Business Conduct and Code of Financial Ethics. Id. at 46–51.

<line: 26> Prior to bringing suit, Levine made several demands that the Board bring suit. Id. at 66. 
<line: 27> Levine’s first demand letter was sent on March 4, 2013. Id. at 67. In that letter, he requested that 
<line: 28> the Board bring suit against Dow’s officers who were involved in the alleged conspiracy to 
<line: 29> price-fix, against Dow’s in-house counsel for “recklessly” allowing Dow to proceed to trial in 
<line: 30> the Urethane Litigation, and against Dow’s management for their “failure to disclose the

<line: 4> egregious conduct” which was the subject of the Urethane Litigation. March 4, 2013 Demand 
<line: 5> Letter, ECF No. 12, Ex. 4. The Board responded to that demand letter by assigning the matter to 
<line: 6> the Board’s Governance Committee. Compl. at 67. That assignment occurred at the Board’s 
<line: 7> April 10–11, 2013, meeting. Id. Also on April 11, 2013, the Governance Committee reviewed 
<line: 8> the demand letter and retained counsel, Kenneth J. Nachbar, to conduct a full evaluation of the 
<line: 9> claim. Id. at 67–68. Levine faults the Governance Committee for retaining counsel so quickly, 
<line: 10> arguing that no detailed analysis of the counsel’s “independence, disinterestedness and 
<line: 11> objectivity” could have been conducted. Id. at 68. Thus, Levine argues that counsel had been 
<line: 12> pre-selected. Id. On May 7, 2013, Nachbar indicated to Levine that the investigation would take 
<line: 13> several months.  

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Levine argues that Mr. Nachbar “lacked the independence, disinterestedness and 
<line: 16> objectivity required under the circumstances.” Id. Mr. Nachbar had previously represented Dow 
<line: 17> and has “a long history of uniformly recommending the rejection of shareholder demands such as 
<line: 18> those made by” Levine. Id. Levine alleges that Mr. Nachbar was selected for that very reason, 
<line: 19> and that Mr. Nachbar concealed the “sham nature” of the investigation by refusing to answer “a 
<line: 20> number of basic questions.” Those questions included whether the Board considered 
<line: 21> disqualifying any Directors from serving on the Governance Committee because of the 
<line: 22> allegations made in the demand letter and whether Mr. Nachbar performed a conflict check 
<line: 23> before accepting the representation. Id. at 71–73.  

[TEXT]
<line: 25> After a judgment of $1.2 billion dollars was entered against Dow in the Urethane 
<line: 26> Litigation, Levine filed two additional demand letters. Id. at 74. In the demand letter of May 21, 
<line: 27> 2013, Levine asserted that Dow was wrongly refusing to record the potential liability for the 
<line: 28> judgment on Dow’s financial statements. ECF No. 12, Ex. 5. In the July 30, 2013, demand letter,

<line: 4> Levine requested that Dow bring suit against its trial counsel for inadequate representation at 
<line: 5> trial. ECF No. 12, Ex. 6. 

[TEXT]
<line: 7> On August 7, 2013, the Board sent a letter to Levine which explained the reasons why the 
<line: 8> Board was rejecting his March 4, 2013, demand. ECF No. 12, Ex. 9. In the letter, the Board 
<line: 9> explained that there “were no viable claims to be brought against any of the Company’s former 
<line: 10> or current officers, directors or employees under Delaware or Michigan law.” Id. at 1. The Board 
<line: 11> found no evidence that any of Dow’s officers or directors were complicit in the alleged price-
<line: 12> fixing, failed to exercise oversight over antitrust compliance efforts, or failed to monitor or 
<line: 13> otherwise mishandled the Urethane Litigation. Id. The Board also explained that even if viable 
<line: 14> claims against Dow’s officers, directors, or employees existed, the claims were likely now barred 
<line: 15> by the statute of limitations. Id. at 2. It additionally reasoned that any potential recovery would 
<line: 16> be a “very small fraction” of the amount at issue in the Urethane Litigation, and thus would not 
<line: 17> be a worthwhile pursuit. Id. The Board further explained that it would not bring suit against the 
<line: 18> Dow officers, directors, and employees allegedly responsible for the antitrust violations because 
<line: 19> doing so would involve Dow asserting that antitrust violations had actually occurred, which 
<line: 20> would “severely undermine” Dow’s efforts to overturn the Urethane Litigation judgment on 
<line: 21> appeal. Id. The Board further referenced “the legal fees the Company would incur” and “the 
<line: 22> possible reputational harm to the Company from pursuing claims” as factors in its decision. Id.  

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Levine discounts the Board’s response by arguing that the investigation was biased 
<line: 25> because “no testimony of any witness was taken under oath and the most material of witnesses 
<line: 26> were never even interviewed.” Compl. at 76. He argues that the Board’s business judgment was 
<line: 27> inadequate because Mr. Nachbar “cherry-picked” facts, resulting in a “whitewashed” 
<line: 28> recommendation. Id.

<line: 4> Levine communicated with Mr. Nachbar on several occasions during the summer and fall 
<line: 5> of 2013. Id. at 78–79. Mr. Nachbar represented that Levine’s July 30, 2013, demand letter was 
<line: 6> scheduled to be considered by the Board at its mid-December meeting. Id. at 78. On November 
<line: 7> 28, 2013, Levine sent another demand letter to the Board. ECF No. 12, Ex. 7. In the letter, 
<line: 8> Levine argued that Mr. Nachbar and his firm had refused to respond to fundamental questions, 
<line: 9> was biased, and was wasting Dow’s assets. Id. He further demanded that Dow commence suit 
<line: 10> against its trial counsel in the Urethane Litigation. Id.

<line: 12> On December 20, 2013, the Board sent Levine a letter which explained that it was 
<line: 13> rejecting his July 30, 2013, demand to bring suit. ECF No. 12, Ex. 10. The letter noted that the 
<line: 14> appeal in the Urethane Litigation was still pending and that the statute of limitations to bring a 
<line: 15> legal malpractice claim had not even begun to run yet. Id. Accordingly, the Board declined to 
<line: 16> negotiate for tolling agreements regarding a legal malpractice claim with its trial counsel. Id.

<line: 18> After the judgment in the Urethane Litigation was affirmed by the Federal Court of

<line: 20> Ex. 8. In the demand, Levine reiterated his previous demands regarding the Urethane Litigation 
<line: 21> and also requested that Dow obtain “written agreements tolling the running of all statutes of 
<line: 22> limitations applicable to the claims identified in my March 4, 2013 and subsequent demand 
<line: 23> letters.” Id. at 2. On December 1, 2014, Mr. Nachbar sent Levine a letter which indicated receipt 
<line: 24> of Levine’s demand and explained that, based on the reasons previously articulated, Dow 
<line: 25> believed that commencing the requested litigation would be counterproductive while Dow was 
<line: 26> appealing the judgment. ECF No. 12, Ex. 14. Rather, Mr. Nachbar indicated that Dow would

<line: 4> After the parties in Wood v. Dow Chem. Co. settled, Levine sent the October 31, 2015,

<line: 16> A pleading fails to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) if it does not contain allegations that 
<line: 17> support recovery under any recognizable legal theory. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 
<line: 18> (2009).  In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court construes the pleading in the non-
<line: 19> movant’s favor and accepts the allegations of facts therein as true. See Lambert, 517 F.3d at 439. 
<line: 20> The pleader need not provide “detailed factual allegations” to survive dismissal, but the 
<line: 21> “obligation to provide the ‘grounds’ of his ‘entitle[ment] to relief’ requires more than labels and 
<line: 22> conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Bell 
<line: 23> Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  In essence, the pleading “must contain 
<line: 24> sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face” 
<line: 25> and “the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is

<line: 11> file an amended complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 15(a), which allows a party to amend a 
<line: 12> pleading with the court’s leave. The Court would allow Levine to file an amended complaint 
<line: 13> alleging specific dates of stock ownership, but Levine’s complaint suffers from other fatal flaws,

<line: 19> Defendants further argue that Levine has not complied with Federal Rule of Civil 
<line: 20> Procedure 23.1(b)(3)’s requirement that Levine allege facts showing that his demand that Dow 
<line: 21> bring suit was wrongfully refused. Rule 23.1(b)(3) requires the plaintiff to “state with 
<line: 22> particularity . . . any effort by the plaintiff to obtain the desired action from the directors or 
<line: 23> comparable authority and, if necessary, from the shareholders or members.” The analysis in 
<line: 24> cases where demand has been made is different from the analysis in cases where the plaintiff is

<line: 26> overruled on other grounds by Brehm v. Eisner, 746 A.2d 244 (Del. 2000). “By electing to make

<line: 7> The business judgment rule is the “presumption that in making a business decision the 
<line: 8> directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that 
<line: 9> the action taken was in the best interests of the company.” Aronson v. Lewis, 473 A.2d 805, 812 
<line: 10> (Del. 1984). The rule is meant to protect corporate decision-making from second-guessing by 
<line: 11> courts. Brown v, Ferro Corp., 763 F.2d 798, 800 n.2 (6th Cir. 1985). When demand has been

<line: 14> doubt that the board is entitled to the benefit of the presumption.” Grimes v. Donald, 673 A.2d

<line: 9> Levine has not adequately pleaded particularized facts creating doubt that the Board was 
<line: 10> independent. By making a demand, Levine has conceded that the Board possesses the 
<line: 11> independence necessary to respond. Accordingly, he must allege particularized facts indicating 
<line: 12> why, specifically, the Board’s actual decision was not independent and disinterested. See Levine, 
<line: 13> 591, A.2d at 212; Friedman v. Maffei, No. CV 11105-VCMR, 2016 WL 1555331, at *8 (Del. 
<line: 14> Ch. Apr. 13, 2016). Levine’s argument that the Board as a whole was biased because the 
<line: 15> directors were accused of wrongdoing in the demand is not sufficient to demonstrate a wrongful 
<line: 16> refusal.  

[TEXT]
<line: 18> Levine argues that the Board’s decision was not independent and disinterested because 
<line: 19> the Board appointed an investigatory committee which was composed “entirely of named 
<line: 20> defendants.” Pl. Brief at 20, ECF No. 25 (emphasis in original). He thus apparently argues that 
<line: 21> the Board was required to “form a perfectly independent special litigation committee,” citing 
<line: 22> Booth Family Trust v. Jeffries, 640 F.3d 134, 143 (6th Cir. 2011). Booth involved a derivative 
<line: 23> suit where the plaintiff did not make a demand and the corporation formed a special litigation 
<line: 24> committee to consider whether to seek dismissal of the suit.  Generally, when demand is made, a 
<line: 25> Board’s refusal to bring suit will be respected unless it is wrongful. Zapata Corp. v. Maldonado,

<line: 7> dismiss derivative litigation.”). Because special litigation committees arise in cases where the 
<line: 8> board is otherwise unqualified to consider the demand, the special litigation committee “has the 
<line: 9> burden of establishing its own independence by a yardstick that must be “like Caesar’s wife”—

<line: 13> In this case, however, Levine made a demand on the Board. Accordingly, he tacitly 
<line: 14> acknowledged that the Board was capable of properly and independently reviewing his claim. 
<line: 15> Levine clearly disagrees with the Board’s refusal to bring suit, but that refusal must be analyzed 
<line: 16> under the deferential business judgment rule, not under the heightened scrutiny applied to special 
<line: 17> litigation committees seeking to distance themselves from a board unqualified to make the 
<line: 18> decision. See City of Orlando Police Pension Fund v. Page, 970 F. Supp. 2d 1022, 1030 (N.D. 
<line: 19> Cal. 2013). By making the demand, Levine evidenced the expectation that the board would 
<line: 20> review the demand and make the decision. Even though, as he now argues, the Board could have 
<line: 21> created an entirely independent special litigation committee to review the demand, it was not 
<line: 22> required to do so. Accordingly, the fact that the composition of the investigation committee 
<line: 23> resembled that of Dow’s Board as a whole is not evidence of wrongful refusal. Id. Likewise, the 
<line: 24> mere fact that the members of the investigation committee unanimously rejected Levine’s 
<line: 25> demands is not a particularized fact which creates a reasonable doubt that the refusal was 
<line: 26> wrongful.

<line: 4> Levine also argues that demand was wrongfully refused because the attorney selected to 
<line: 5> investigate the demand was improperly chosen. He specifically argues that the attorney, Kenneth 
<line: 6> Nachbar, had been preselected by the Board, had previously represented Dow, and had a “well-
<line: 7> established reputation” for recommending the rejection of shareholder demands. Pl. Br. at 22. 
<line: 8> These allegations and arguments are insufficient to establish wrongful refusal. To begin with, 
<line: 9> Delaware law provides that a board member is “fully protected in relying in good faith upon . . . 
<line: 10> information, opinions, reports, or statements presented . . . by any other person as to matters the 
<line: 11> member reasonably believes are within such other person’s professional and expert competence 
<line: 12> and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the corporation.” 8 Del. C. § 
<line: 13> 141(e).   

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Levine argues that, because Mr. Nachbar was retained on the same day the demand was 
<line: 16> referred to the investigation committee, he was “preselected” as part of an effort by Defendants 
<line: 17> to reach the preordained conclusion that the demand would be rejected. This bare allegation is 
<line: 18> not sufficiently particularized to create reasonable doubt that Mr. Nachbar was not selected with 
<line: 19> reasonable care. To begin with, Levine admits that Mr. Nachbar and his firm are “highly 
<line: 20> competent with respect to corporate governance issues and litigation.” Compl. at 69. Thus, 
<line: 21> Levine’s argument is merely that Mr. Nachbar was selected without adequate investigation and

<line: 23> Mr. Nachbar prior to the meeting. Further, Levine argues that Mr. Nachbar’s prior relationship 
<line: 24> with Dow disqualified him from representing Dow regarding Levine’s demand. But the fact that

<line: 4> demands. Levine does not allege any particularized facts suggesting that Mr. Nachbar was 
<line: 5> unsuited to investigate Levine’s demand.  

[TEXT]
<line: 7> Levine also argues that Mr. Nachbar lacked independence because he had previously 
<line: 8> represented Dow in high profile legal matters and had a reputation for recommending the 
<line: 9> rejection of shareholder demands. In In re Consumers Power Co. Derivative Litig., 132 F.R.D. 
<line: 10> 455, 474 (E.D. Mich. 1990), the plaintiffs argued that the demand denial was wrongful because 
<line: 11> the “investigation and ultimate decision relied too extensively on biased information from the 
<line: 12> attorneys who had previously defended the corporation and individual defendants over similar 
<line: 13> claims of mismanagement and other wrongdoing.” The Consumer Power court rejected that 
<line: 14> argument, reasoning that plaintiffs had “not presented the court a scintilla of factual evidence 
<line: 15> suggesting that [the attorney or his firm had] . . . violated any professional obligation to the 
<line: 16> client. Id. at 478. Likewise, plaintiffs did not present facts demonstrating that counsel had given 
<line: 17> “biased or inaccurate advice” to the Board. Id. See also Belendiuk v. Carrion, No. CV 9026-ML, 
<line: 18> 2014 WL 3589500, at *6 (Del. Ch. July 22, 2014) (“Belendiuk makes no attempt to allege that 
<line: 19> Cravath was not selected with reasonable care or that the matters on which Cravath offered 
<line: 20> advice were outside its professional competence.”). Even though Mr. Nachbar might have 
<line: 21> previously represented Dow and previously recommended rejection of shareholder demands, that 
<line: 22> does not establish sufficient bias or lack of independence to make Mr. Nachbar’s selection 
<line: 23> unreasonable. Levine has offered only general, conclusory allegations regarding the process by 
<line: 24> which Mr. Nachbar was selected. Thus, Levine has not rebutted the presumption that Mr. 
<line: 25> Nachbar was retained in good faith and after a reasonable investigation.

<line: 4> Levine next argues that the investigation by Mr. Nachbar and the investigation committee 
<line: 5> was conducted in bad faith. Levine’s argument here retreads much of the same ground Levine 
<line: 6> covers in his argument that the Board’s decision was not independent. He asserts that the 
<line: 7> investigation committee and Mr. Nachbar prejudged the merits of the suit and thus 
<line: 8> predetermined the outcome of the investigation. In support, Levine cites London v. Tyrrell, No. 
<line: 9> CIV.A. 3321-CC, 2010 WL 877528, at *15 (Del. Ch. Mar. 11, 2010), and Abella v. Universal 
<line: 10> Leaf Tobacco Co., 546 F. Supp. 795, 799 (E.D. Va. 1982). The courts in both those cases 
<line: 11> indicated skepticism about whether a special litigation committee had predetermined the 
<line: 12> outcome of the investigation and thus was not independent. But, as already explained, the 
<line: 13> standard in cases involving special litigation committees is different from demand refusal cases, 
<line: 14> where the business judgment rule is applied. London and Abella are thus inapposite.     

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Levine also argues that the $1.2 billion judgment entered against Dow in the Urethane 
<line: 17> Litigation contradicted the Board’s conclusion in its demand rejection letter that there were no 
<line: 18> viable claims to be brought against Dow’s former officers, directors, or employees. But “mere 
<line: 19> disagreement with the Committee’s ultimate conclusion, as well as its subsidiary conclusions 
<line: 20> leading thereto, [is] insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt that the Board acted in good faith and 
<line: 21> on an informed basis.” Andreotti, 2015 WL 2270673, at *27. In Andreotti, the company had been 
<line: 22> sanctioned in a separate action for making an “untenable” and “mendacious” argument. Id. at 
<line: 23> *28. The plaintiff argued that the board had acted in bad faith in refusing to bring suit because of 
<line: 24> that decision, reasoning that the board “could not reasonably determine that the $1 billion verdict 
<line: 25> and the since-affirmed Sanctions Order [were] not products of some wrongdoing or culpability 
<line: 26> on the part of at least some members of the Board or senior officers of the Company.” Id. 
<line: 27> (emphasis in original). The Andreotti court rejected that argument, explaining that “Plaintiff does

<line: 4> not identify just what the breach of duty involved would have been, nor does the Plaintiff 
<line: 5> identify what the damages would have been, as would make such litigation an irresistible asset 
<line: 6> for the Company to pursue.” Id.  

[TEXT]
<line: 8> That reasoning applies with considerable force here. The jury verdict in the Urethane 
<line: 9> Litigation might provide evidence that some Dow employees were involved in wrongdoing, but 
<line: 10> Levine has not identified which particular Defendants they are. Likewise, Levine has only made 
<line: 11> conclusory allegations regarding the potential damages Dow could recover. Further, Levine has 
<line: 12> not pleaded specific factual allegations regarding the contentions made and established in the 
<line: 13> Urethane Litigation. While the Court can take judicial notice of the existence of that litigation, 
<line: 14> the Court cannot take judicial notice of the allegations made or conclusions reached within that 
<line: 15> litigation. See Passa, 123 F. App’x at 697. Because the mere fact that Dow was sued for antitrust 
<line: 16> law violations, chose to take the case to trial, and sustained a verdict against it is insufficient to 
<line: 17> establish that the Board acted in bad faith, Levine has not adequately pleaded wrongful refusal. 

[TEXT]
<line: 19> Additionally, the Board explained in the demand rejection letter that, even if there were 
<line: 20> potential claims to be brought against the officers, directors, and employees allegedly engaged in 
<line: 21> wrongdoing related to the antitrust violations, the Board still believed that doing so would be 
<line: 22> counterproductive. Specifically, the Board mentioned that bringing suit would undermine Dow’s 
<line: 23> then-ongoing appeal of the judgment entered against it,2 would incur substantial legal fees and 

[ABANDON]
<line: 25> 2 Levine argues that, because the lawsuit was settled in February 2016, this rationale no longer applies. But Levine 
<line: 26> initiated this derivative suit in April 2016, only two months after the settlement. Levine’s argument is thus 
<line: 27> counterintuitive. To the extent he argues that Dow should have settled the Urethane Litigation, the settlement 
<line: 28> resolved that issue. To the extent he argues that suit should be brought against Defendants for mishandling the 
<line: 29> litigation, he gave Dow very little time to investigate its post-settlement options once the resolution of the Urethane 
<line: 30> Litigation had been finalized. In neither scenario has Levine pleaded particularized facts which raise reasonable 
<line: 31> doubts about the Board’s good faith. Levine argues that Mr. Nachbar’s December 1, 2014, letter, which indicates 
<line: 32> that Dow would consider Levine’s demand “on its merits” if the judgment in the Urethane Litigation remained in 
<line: 33> effect after the appeals process, indicates that a comprehensive investigation had not yet been undertaken. Letter, 
<line: 34> ECF No. 12, Ex. 14. But that letter also indicated that it was premised on “the reasons previously communicated to 
<line: 35> [Levine]” regarding the decision to not bring suit. Id. To the extent the letter asserted that Levine’s demands would

<line: 4> other costs, and would cause Dow “reputational harm.” Demand Rejection Letter at 2, ECF No. 
<line: 5> 12, Ex. 9. “A board may in good faith refuse a shareholder demand to begin litigation even if 
<line: 6> there is substantial basis to conclude that the lawsuit would eventually be successful on the 
<line: 7> merits.” In re INFOUSA, Inc. Shareholders Litig., 953 A.2d 963, 986 (Del. Ch. 2007). The 
<line: 8> decision to settle a lawsuit, to take a lawsuit to trial, or to seek contribution from persons 
<line: 9> “involved in the conduct underlying a suit against the corporation [are] business decision[s] 
<line: 10> within the discretion of the board.” White v. Panic, 783 A.2d 543, 553 (Del. 2001). Levine has 
<line: 11> not pleaded any specific facts which raise reasonable doubt that the Board’s decision, on these 
<line: 12> grounds, was not made with the best interests of Dow in mind. Accordingly, Levine has not 
<line: 13> raised a reasonable doubt that the Board acted in good faith.  

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Levine also argues that the refusal of Defendants’ counsel to provide information 
<line: 16> regarding the Board’s investigation raised reasonable doubts about the good faith of the 
<line: 17> investigation. He asserts that any inadequacies in his Complaint stem from the Board’s refusal to 
<line: 18> provide information regarding the nature of its investigation. In Scattered, the Delaware Supreme 
<line: 19> Court rejected a similar argument made by the plaintiffs. 701 A.2d at 78. The Scattered Court 
<line: 20> emphasized that the plaintiffs had “not taken advantage” of their right under 8 Del. C. § 220 to 
<line: 21> “inspect minutes, reports, and other books and records . . . targeted at the process and findings of 
<line: 22> the Board, the Special Committee and the Executive Committee in acting on this demand.” Id. 
<line: 23> (emphasis in original). See also Friedman v. Maffei, No. CV 11105-VCMR, 2016 WL 1555331, 
<line: 24> at *16 (Del. Ch. Apr. 13, 2016) (holding that because the plaintiff did not seek access to the 
<line: 25> investigatory committee’s report, the generalized reasoning in the demand rejection letter did not 
<line: 26> raise reasonable doubt that the investigation was conducted in good faith).

<line: 28> be further considered after the appeals process, it indicates only that the company would reconsider the value of 
<line: 29> bringing suit. The remainder of Levine’s exhibits make clear that the Board did conduct an investigation into the 
<line: 30> merits of his claims prior to rejecting his demand.

<line: 4> Levine argues that the description of the investigation in the demand rejection letter was 
<line: 5> conclusory and thus that he was placed in a “Catch-22” whereby Levine was required to plead 
<line: 6> particularized factual allegations regarding the insufficiency of the investigation, but the Board 
<line: 7> had refused to provide any information about the procedures used. See In re Consumers Power 
<line: 8> Co. Derivative Litig., 132 F.R.D. at 462.3 However, this argument conflicts with Levine’s 
<line: 9> alternative representation that there was no need to make a books and records demand under 8 
<line: 10> Del. C. § 220 because “there were ample facts already available to him to allege with 
<line: 11> particularity how the Board’s” refusal was wrongful. Pl. Brief. at 26. If Levine had ample facts, 
<line: 12> then there is no excuse for the lack of particularity in his allegations. Further, the Delaware 
<line: 13> Supreme Court has explicitly rejected the argument that the pleading standard of 23.1 should be 
<line: 14> lessened simply because plaintiffs may have difficulty satisfying the standard without the benefit 
<line: 15> of discovery. Scattered Corp., 701 A.2d at 78. Levine did not avail himself of all “tools at hand” 
<line: 16> and thus has not demonstrated reasonable doubt as to whether his demand was wrongfully 
<line: 17> refused.

<line: 21> Levine next argues that the Board did not act in an informed manner and with due care in 
<line: 22> refusing his demand that the Board sue the individual Defendants for breaching their duty of 
<line: 23> oversight concerning the antitrust violations and litigation. In particular, he cites Barovic v. 
<line: 24> Ballmer, where the court held that the plaintiff had called the sufficiency of the Board’s 
<line: 25> investigation into dispute by specifically identifying a set of witnesses that were not interviewed. 

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 3 In further support of that argument, Levine cites City of Orlando Police Pension Fund v. Page, where the court 
<line: 28> found that the Board’s refusal to make the committee’s report public, combined with the conclusory nature of the 
<line: 29> demand rejection letter, created reasonable doubt as to whether the refusal was in good faith. 970 F. Supp. 2d 1022, 
<line: 30> 1030 (N.D. Cal. 2013). But this reasoning conflicts with the Delaware Supreme Court’s clear direction that the 
<line: 31> burden is on the plaintiff to seek information regarding the demand refusal. See Grimes v. Donald, 673 A.2d 1207, 
<line: 32> 1218 (Del. 1996); Scattered Corp., 701 A.2d at 78. The Board is not required to preemptively make the details of its 
<line: 33> investigation public.

<line: 4> 72 F. Supp. 3d 1210, 1215–16 (W.D. Wash. 2014). He also argues that the Board improperly

[TEXT]
<line: 7> In order to raise a reasonable doubt that the Board’s lack of due care in investigating 
<line: 8> made the demand refusal wrongful, Levine must allege particularized facts indicating that the 
<line: 9> Board’s behavior constituted gross negligence, which means “reckless indifference or actions 
<line: 10> that are without the bounds of reason.” McPadden v. Sidhu, 964 A.2d 1262, 1274 (Del. Ch. 
<line: 11> 2008). See also Belendiuk v. Carrion, No. CV 9026-ML, 2014 WL 3589500, at *6 (Del. Ch. July 
<line: 12> 22, 2014). Making that showing is difficult because there is “no prescribed procedure that a 
<line: 13> board must follow” in responding to a demand. Levine, 591 A.2d at 214. “In any investigation, 
<line: 14> the choice of people to interview or documents to review is one on which reasonable minds may 
<line: 15> differ.” Mount Moriah Cemetery on Behalf of Dun & Bradstreet Corp. v. Moritz, No. CIV.A. 
<line: 16> 11431, 1991 WL 50149, at *4 (Del. Ch. Apr. 4, 1991). See also Gatz v. Ponsoldt, No. CIV.A. 
<line: 17> 174-N, 2004 WL 3029868, at *5 (Del. Ch. Nov. 5, 2004). Likewise, the Board does not 
<line: 18> necessarily need to receive a written report before deciding to refuse the demand. Belendiuk,

<line: 26> adequate. See Page, 970 F. Supp. 2d at 1032 (finding that any reasonable investigation would

<line: 4> information and that, because there was no evidence they were interviewed, the Board did not 
<line: 5> interview those directors. In Copeland v. Lane, the court rejected a similar argument, explaining 
<line: 6> that the plaintiff had not identified “individuals who should have been interviewed but were not, 
<line: 7> how those unidentified individuals had knowledge that was unique and unobtainable without 
<line: 8> those interviews, and how those interviews if taken would have altered the Board’s decision to 
<line: 9> refuse demand.” No. 5:11-CV-01058 EJD, 2012 WL 4845636, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 10, 2012). 
<line: 10> Levine has not specifically alleged what information these directors had which would not have 
<line: 11> been uncovered elsewhere during the investigation. For that reason, the Court cannot conclude 
<line: 12> that a failure to interview unspecified non-management directors, if indeed they were not 
<line: 13> interviewed, constituted gross negligence.  

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Levine next argues that the Board’s investigation was inadequate because the demand 
<line: 16> rejection letter only mentioned reviewing the depositions and trial record from the Urethane 
<line: 17> Litigation. He argues that those documents could not provide insight into whether the individual 
<line: 18> Defendants “breached their fiduciary duties of oversight.” Pl. Br. at 29. Levine also argues that 
<line: 19> the Board abdicated its responsibility for conducting the investigation to Mr. Nachbar. These 
<line: 20> allegations fall far short of raising a reasonable doubt that the Board’s investigation was grossly 
<line: 21> negligent. First, Levine has not pleaded particularized facts indicating that the Board’s 
<line: 22> investigation was pro forma or superficial. In the demand rejection letter, the Board indicated 
<line: 23> that the Governance Committee had “reviewed, among other materials, substantial portions of 
<line: 24> the deposition and trial record in the Urethane Litigation . . . , including the sworn deposition and 
<line: 25> trial testimony of the former Dow employees allegedly involved in the price-fixing activities 
<line: 26> alleged in that litigation.” Demand Rejection Letter at 1. Because the Board reviewed testimony 
<line: 27> given by those Dow employees accused of being involved in the price-fixing, the investigation

[TEXT]
<line: 4> was not grossly negligent. The investigation focused on the employees that were closest to the 
<line: 5> controversy and thus most likely to be found culpable. Levine might believe that the Board 
<line: 6> should have investigated other individuals as well, but the decision regarding who to investigate 
<line: 7> and how to investigate them is typically one about which reasonable minds can disagree. Mount 
<line: 8> Moriah Cemetery on Behalf of Dun & Bradstreet Corp., 1991 WL 50149, at *4. Levine has not 
<line: 9> satisfied his burden of pleading particularized facts which indicate that any decision the Board 
<line: 10> made regarding how to conduct the investigation were grossly negligent.  

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Further, a board is entitled to “rely on competent counsel as its agent” in conducting 
<line: 13> interviews and otherwise investigating. In re Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Derivative 
<line: 14> Litig., No. 1:06CV5279 LTS/DFE, 2009 WL 1066251, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 21, 2009). See also

<line: 16> 15, 1995) (explaining that “heavy reliance on . . . competent attorneys does not render [the] 
<line: 17> investigation unreasonable”). As already explained, Levine has admitted that Mr. Nachbar is 
<line: 18> competent and has not pleaded particularized facts suggesting that his investigation was biased 
<line: 19> or otherwise inadequate.  

[TEXT]
<line: 21> Accordingly, Levine has not met his burden of pleading particularized facts which create 
<line: 22> a reasonable doubt as to whether his demand was wrongfully refused. For that reason, Levine’s

<line: 7> In cases where the plaintiff has initiated a derivative suit before the Board has formally

<line: 11> Bank of Am. Corp. v. Mozilo, 135 F. Supp. 3d 178, 183 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). That reasonableness 
<line: 12> analysis focuses on the “complexity of the technological, quantitative, and legal issues raised by 
<line: 13> the demand.” Allison on Behalf of Gen. Motors Corp. v. Gen. Motors Corp., 604 F. Supp. 1106, 
<line: 14> 1117–18 (D. Del.). When a board “takes some action in response to a demand” but has not yet 
<line: 15> issued a “formal response,” Steinberg, 135 F. Supp. 3d at 184, “the methods and manner in 
<line: 16> which the board has chosen to act on the demand represent judgments entitled to the benefit of

<line: 7> Accordingly, the Board has taken some action in response to Levine’s demand. Although 
<line: 8> the status and details of the investigation have not been disclosed to Levine, the Board has not 
<line: 9> simply ignored his demand. For that reason, the protection of the business judgment rule applies 
<line: 10> to the Board’s method and manner of responding to the demand. Rich, 66 A.3d at 977.  

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Levine has not adequately alleged facts which suggest that the Board’s investigation has 
<line: 13> been uninformed or otherwise conducted in bad faith. Rather, he argues that the demand 
<line: 14> involved simple issues which could have been sufficiently investigated in only a few months. 
<line: 15> But Levine’s demand asserted “very substantial misuse” of Dow assets and “material financial 
<line: 16> statement fraud” that occurred over a number of years. Oct. 31, 2015, Demand, ECF No. 12, Ex. 
<line: 17> 3. Regardless of whether these allegations had already been investigated by other entities within 
<line: 18> Dow, the Board’s decision to take Levine’s demand seriously and conduct a comprehensive 
<line: 19> investigation cannot be considered bad faith. Because Levine has not alleged any specific acts of 
<line: 20> misconduct or delay involving the investigation, other than the mere fact that it is still ongoing, 
<line: 21> he has not alleged facts sufficient to overcome the protections of the business judgment rule. See 
<line: 22> Steinberg, 135 F. Supp. 3d at 185 (dismissing a derivative action brought under a constructive 
<line: 23> denial rationale six months after demand because the plaintiff had not alleged particular facts 
<line: 24> suggesting that the investigation constituted a breach of fiduciary duties). Levine’s claims 
<line: 25> relating to Defendant Liveris’s alleged misuse of Dow assets will be dismissed without 
<line: 26> prejudice. Levine may refile after receiving a response to his demand if he wishes to challenge
