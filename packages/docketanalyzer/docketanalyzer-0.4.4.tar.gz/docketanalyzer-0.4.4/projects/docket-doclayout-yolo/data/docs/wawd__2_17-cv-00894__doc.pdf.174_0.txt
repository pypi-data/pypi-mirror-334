<line: 48> (1)
<line: 49>  Plaintiff Eko Brands, LLC's motion to amend judgment, docket no. 151, is
<line: 50> GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, as follows:

[TEXT]
<line: 52> (a)
<line: 53> With regard to the reasonable royalty awarded to plaintiff by a jury.
<line: 54> in the prior patent litigation between the parties, plaintiff's motion to amend
<line: 55> Paragraphs 46-48 of the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, docket no. 149.
<line: 56> to reflect that plaintiff may elect between such royalty award and a disgorgement
<line: 57> of defendants' profit associated with products bearing the marks ECO FILL
<line: 58> DELUXE, ECO FILL DELUXE 2.0, or ECO-FLOW during the period from
<line: 59> April 2, 2015, through June 8, 2018, is DENIED. Despite its awareness long
<line: 60> before trial that double recovery was an issue in this case, plaintiff did not
<line: 61> previously contend that it is entitled to such election. See Zimmerman v. City of
<line: 62> Oakland, 255 F.3d 734, 740 (9th Cir. 2001) (observing that a district court "does
<line: 63> not abuse its discretion when it disregards legal arguments made for the first time
<line: 64> on a motion to amend'). Moreover, the authorities upon which plaintiff relies do
<line: 65> not support its position. In Aero Prods. Int'l, Inc. v. Intex Recreation Corp., 466
<line: 66> F.3d 1000 (Fed. Cir. 2006), the Federal Circuit made clear that patent infringement
<line: 67> and trademark infringement damages may not be awarded for the same sales of the

<line: 26> same accused devices. Id. at 1016-20. Nowhere in the decision does the Federal
<line: 27> Circuit discuss the concept of an "election" between remedies. Moreover, Aero
<line: 28> involves patent and trademark infringement damages that were awarded in the
<line: 29> same trial. In this matter, plaintiff had already obtained the patent royalty award,
<line: 30> and the award had already been affirmed by the Federal Circuit. before the Court.
<line: 31> issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on January 30, 2020. See
<line: 32> Eko Brands, LLC v. Adrian Rivera Maynez Enters., Inc., 946 F.3d 1367 (Fed. Cir.
<line: 33> 2020) (decided Jan. 13, 2020). Although a similar sequence was at issue in Apple,
<line: 34> Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., 2014 WL 4467837 (N.D. Cal. 2014), which was also
<line: 35> cited by plaintiff, in that case, the district court acknowledged the double-recovery
<line: 36> problem presented by an award of damages in a prior case for design patent
<line: 37> infringement and the award of damages in the instant case for infringement of
<line: 38> utility patents, but it opted not to eliminate any duplicative damages until after the
<line: 39> appeals in both cases had been resolved. Id. at *25. The Apple Court did not
<line: 40> indicate how it would resolve the double-recovery issue or suggest that the matter
<line: 41> would be subject to the plaintiff's unilateral election, but rather stated that it would
<line: 42> "consult with the parties" and "allow for appropriate briefing' after both appeals
<line: 43> were resolved. Id. at *26. The procedural posture of this case is entirely different
<line: 44> and plaintiff has recovered the amount adequate to compensate it for patent and
<line: 45> trademark infringement for the period from April 2, 2015, through June 8, 2018

[TEXT]
<line: 47> (b)
<line: 48> With regard to plaintiff's and defendants' products' respective
<line: 49> compatibility with the Keurig@ 2.0 machine, plaintiff's motion to amend
<line: 50> Paragraphs 49-52 of the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, docket no. 149,
<line: 51> to reflect that defendants' profit associated with the ECO FILL 2.0 product is
<line: 52> attributable solely to trademark infringement and/or unfair competition, is
<line: 53> DENIED. Plaintiff's motion to amend merely relitigates matters decided by the
<line: 54> Court. See Zimmerman, 255 F.3d at 740 (affirming the denial of a Rule 59(e)
<line: 55> motion because it "repeated legal arguments made earlier and sought to introduce
<line: 56> facts that were available earlier"'). Plaintiff has not assigned error to Chart 1 on
<line: 57> Page 25 of the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, docket no. 149, which
<line: 58> reflects the data in Trial Exhibit 473, and Chart 1 supports the Court's conclusion
<line: 59> that defendants' gross revenues for their ECO FILL products correlated with
<line: 60> defendants' introduction of an operable reusable filter for Keurig@ 2.0 machines,
<line: 61> as opposed to their use of the mark ECO FILL. As reflected in Chart 1, for almost
<line: 62> a year before Keurig placed its 2.0 machine on the market in October 2014.
<line: 63> defendants experienced virtually de minimis sales of ECO FILL products, but
<line: 64> shortly thereafter, defendants' gross revenues soared. When other manufacturers,
<line: 65> including Keurig, began offering cartridges compatible with the 2.0 machines
<line: 66> defendants' market share declined. Plaintiff's contention that defendants' residual
<line: 67> volume of sales (for the years 2016-2018) relating to their 2.0 compatible product
<line: 68> is tied exclusively to the use of the ECO FILL mark, as opposed to other factors
<line: 69> like customer loyalty to a product first used before other options became available

[ABANDON]
<line: 71> MINUTE ORDER - 2

[TEXT]
<line: 2> is undermined by the market-share information that plaintiff unsuccessfully
<line: 3> attempted to introduce at trial. See Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 34
<line: 4> n.19 (docket no. 149). Over the years following Keurig's redesign, plaintiff has
<line: 5> lost ground to Keurig, which does not use any mark containing ECO or EKO, and
<line: 6> not to defendants, whose percentage of industry sales has remained fairly steady
<line: 7> Moreover, during the years 2016 through 2018, defendants experienced net losses
<line: 8> with respect to the ECO FILL 2.0 product, and thus, any error in not disgorging to
<line: 9> plaintiff the profit associated with that product for those years is harmless.' In
<line: 10> contrast, plaintiff was awarded all of the net profits associated with the ECO FILL
<line: 11> 1.0 product, see Tables 1 and 2 of the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
<line: 12> (docket no. 149); see also new Table 3 attached hereto (see  1(d), below), and it
<line: 13> therefore cannot be heard to complain.

<line: 39> (c) With regard to defendants' profits associated with ECO CAFAFE
<line: 40> filters, plaintiff's motion to amend Paragraph 60 of the Findings of Fact and.
<line: 41> Conclusions of Law, docket no. 149, to reflect that, notwithstanding plaintiff's
<line: 42> lack of a competing product, such profits are attributable solely to use of the mark
<line: 43> ECO CARAFE and must be disgorged to plaintiff, is DENIED. Plaintiff's.
<line: 44> assertion that the Court erred in not awarding ECO CARAFE related profits
<line: 45> simply because plaintiff did not have a directly competing product misapprehends
<line: 46> the Court's ruling. The Court did not consider the absence of a competing product
<line: 47> as a standalone reason for denying disgorgement, but rather as circumstantial
<line: 48> evidence that the profits at issue were attributable to a factor other than use of the
<line: 49> mark ECO CARAFE. Neither of the Ninth Circuit opinions cited by plaintiff
<line: 50> support a different result. In Maier Brewing Co. v. Fleischmann Distilling Corp.,
<line: 51> 390 F.2d 117 (9th Cir. 1968), although the products were different, they bore the
<line: 52> identical mark, namely "Black & White," which the trademark registrant had used
<line: 53> in interstate commerce for more than 50 years in connection with its "scotch of
<line: 54> excellent reputation," and which the infringers used for beer, but apparently only
<line: 55> within intrastate commerce. Id. at 120. In affirming the district court's award of
<line: 56> an accounting of the infringers' profits, the Ninth Circuit recognized that such
<line: 57> remedy protects not only against a diversion of sales in the context of competing
<line: 58> products, but also from the possibility that customers who buy an infringer's
<line: 59> product, believing it was manufactured by a registrant, might be so unhappy that
<line: 60> they will never again buy any item produced by the registrant. Id. at 122. This

<line: 26> risk, and the need in equity to address it, diminishes substantially when the marks 
<line: 27> at issue are not even close to being identical and the registrant offers no competing 
<line: 28> product, as was the situation in this case.  While Maier is merely distinguishable, 
<line: 29> TrafficSchool.com, Inc. v. eDriver Inc., 653 F.3d 820 (9th Cir. 2011), on which 
<line: 30> plaintiff also relies, actually undermines plaintiff’s position.  In TrafficSchool, the 
<line: 31> Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of the plaintiffs’ request for an 
<line: 32> award of profits, reasoning that, in connection with their false advertising claim, 
<line: 33> the plaintiffs did not offer any proof of past injury or causation, and thus, the 
<line: 34> district court could not determine “with any degree of certainty what award would 
<line: 35> be compensatory.”  Id. at 831.  In this matter, the Court has concluded that, given 
<line: 36> the relative weakness of plaintiff’s EKO BREW mark, the minimal similarity of 
<line: 37> defendants’ ECO CARAFE mark, and plaintiff’s lack of a competing product in 
<line: 38> 2015, when defendants actually generated a net profit, any disgorgement of such 
<line: 39> profit, which was attributable to a factor other than unfair competition, would not 
<line: 40> be consistent with the Lanham Act’s mandate that an award be compensatory, and 
<line: 41> not punitive, in nature.  See id. (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a)). 

[TEXT]
<line: 43> (d) 
<line: 44> With regard to the calculation of defendants’ profits to be disgorged 
<line: 45> to plaintiff, plaintiff’s motion to amend Tables 1 and 2 of the Findings of Fact and 
<line: 46> Conclusions of Law, docket no. 149, to disregard the data in Trial Exhibit 274, is 
<line: 47> DENIED.  Plaintiff is simply mistaken in its belief that Trial Exhibit 274 does not 
<line: 48> contain information for defendants’ ECO FILTER, ECO SAVE, and ECO PURE 
<line: 49> products.  The figures derived from Trial Exhibit 274 are set forth in the attached 
<line: 50> spreadsheet, which is hereby incorporated in the Findings of Fact and Conclusions 
<line: 51> of Law as new Table 3.

<line: 53> (e) 
<line: 54> With regard to defendants’ profits after August 1, 2019, plaintiff’s 
<line: 55> motion to amend Paragraph 53 of the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 
<line: 56> docket no. 149, to award disgorgement to plaintiff in an amount to be determined 
<line: 57> after defendants submit an accounting of profits from September 16, 2019, until 
<line: 58> June 30, 2020, is DENIED.  Plaintiff did not raise this rather sensible solution 
<line: 59> prior to filing its motion to amend judgment, but instead previously argued that it 
<line: 60> was entitled to an award of defendants’ profits at the rate of $57,092 per month.  
<line: 61> Plaintiff appears to concede that its position was unsupported by any evidence.  
<line: 62> The Court will not now permit plaintiff, at significant prejudice to defendants, to 
<line: 63> fundamentally alter the nature of its legal strategy and the factual basis for its 
<line: 64> claim of post-trial damages.
