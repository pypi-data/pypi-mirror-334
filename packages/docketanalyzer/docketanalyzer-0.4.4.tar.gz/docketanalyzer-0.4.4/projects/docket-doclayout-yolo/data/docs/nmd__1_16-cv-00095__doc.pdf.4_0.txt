<line: 20> ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> THIS MATTER is before the Court on Plaintiff’s Application to Proceed in District Court 
<line: 23> without Prepaying Fees or Costs [Doc. 2], filed on February 8, 2016.  Plaintiff has failed to submit 
<line: 24> a certified copy of his inmate account statement as required by 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(2).  In his 
<line: 25> application, Plaintiff informs the Court that he requested his inmate account statement, but “[t]hey 
<line: 26> sent me someone else[’s] statement and now won’t even reply.”  [Doc. 2] at 3.  He appears to ask 
<line: 27> the Court to take judicial notice of the financial certificates filed in another pending civil rights 
<line: 28> case in this Court.  See Latham v. Corizon Health Servs., 15-cv-1076-MCA-CG.  The Court may 
<line: 29> “take judicial notice of its own records.”  St. Louis Baptist Temple, Inc. v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., 
<line: 30> 605 F.2d 1169, 1172 (10th Cir. 1979).  Although § 1915(a)(2) requires “a prisoner seeking to 
<line: 31> bring a civil action . . . without prepayment of fees . . . [to] submit a certified copy of the trust fund 
<line: 32> account statement (or institutional equivalent) for the prisoner for the 6-month period immediately 
<line: 33> preceding the filing of the complaint,” the Court will take judicial notice of the financial 
<line: 34> certificates provided in Latham, 15-CV-1076-MCA-CG [Docs. 74, 68, 67], in light of Plaintiff’s

[TEXT]
<line: 4> alleged difficulty in obtaining a certified copy of his inmate account statement. The Court
<line: 5> notifies Plaintiff, however, that his pro se status does not excuse the obligation to comply with the
<line: 6> fundamental requirements of s 1915 and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  See Ogden v. San
<line: 7> Juan Cty., 32 F.3d 452, 455 (1994).

[TEXT]
<line: 9> Based on the information about Plaintiff's financial status, the Court will waive an initial
<line: 10> partial payment pursuant to $ 1915(b)(1). Because the Court grants the application, the filing fee
<line: 11> for this civil rights complaint is $350. Plaintiff is required to pay the full amount of the filing fee
<line: 12> pursuant to s 1915(b)(1). Failure to comply with this order may result in dismissal of the
<line: 13> complaint without further notice.

[TEXT]
<line: 15> IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Plaintiff's Application to Proceed in District Court
<line: 16> without Prepaying Fees or Costs [Doc. 2] is GRANTED, and the initial payment is WAIVED;

[TEXT]
<line: 18> IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiff file monthly financial certificates and make
<line: 19> monthly payments of 20% of the preceding month's income credited to his account or show cause
<line: 20> why the payment should be excused; and the Clerk is directed to provide Plaintiff with two copies
<line: 21> of the post-filing financial certificate.

[TITLE]
<line: 23> IT IS SO ORDERED.
