<line: 23> MEMORANDUM OPINION 

[TEXT]
<line: 25> THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendants Jason Clem, M.D. (“Dr. 
<line: 26> Clem”) and Angela Frey, R.N.’s (“Nurse Frey”) (collectively, the “Medical Defendants”) 
<line: 27> Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 17).1  
<line: 28> Also pending before the Court is Defendants Captain Shytina Drummond and CO II 
<line: 29> Daniel Price’s (collectively, the “State Defendants”) Motion to Dismiss or, in the 
<line: 30> Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 31).2  The Motions are ripe for 
<line: 31> disposition, and no hearing is necessary.  See Local Rule 105.6 (D.Md. 2016).  For the 
<line: 32> reasons outlined below, the Court will grant both Motions.

<line: 34> I. 
<line: 35> BACKGROUND3 

[TEXT]
<line: 37> Plaintiff Ian Brown is a state inmate currently confined at the Eastern Correctional 
<line: 38> Institution (“ECI”) in Westover, Maryland.  (Compl. at 1, ECF No. 1).  On March 28, 

[ABANDON]
<line: 40> 1 Defendant “RN Vickie” has not been served with the Complaint.  Accordingly, 
<line: 41> the Court will dismiss Brown’s claims against RN Vickie without prejudice.  
<line: 42> 2 The Clerk shall amend the docket to reflect the correct names of Defendants 
<line: 43> Shytina Drummond and Daniel Price. 
<line: 44> 3 Unless otherwise noted, the facts outlined here are uncontroverted and the Court 
<line: 45> views them in the light most favorable to Brown. 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> 2016, Brown reported to the medical department complaining he had been vomiting 
<line: 3> continuously for the previous two days.  (Id. at 5; Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss Ex. 4 at 2–3, ECF 
<line: 4> No. 17-4).  The nurse instructed Brown to avoid eating until he had stopped vomiting for 
<line: 5> twenty-four hours, drink small sips of water, and remain on bed rest for three days.  
<line: 6> (Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss Ex. 4 at 3).  She advised Brown to return to the medical department 
<line: 7> if he did not improve after three days.  (Id.).   

[TEXT]
<line: 9> Brown filed a “Sick Call Request/Encounter Form” on April 10, 2016, explaining 
<line: 10> he had recently recovered from a “virus” but was sick again.  (Defs.’ Reply Opp. Mot. 
<line: 11> Dismiss Ex. 1 at 30).  On April 13, 2016, a nurse practitioner diagnosed Brown with 
<line: 12> “acute pancreatitis” and admitted him to the prison infirmary.  (Compl. at 5; Defs.’ Mot. 
<line: 13> Dismiss Ex. 4 at 5–7).  While in the infirmary, Nurse Frey administered Brown an IV for 
<line: 14> dehydration and medicine to treat his nausea.  (Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss Ex. 4 at 8).  Dr. Clem 
<line: 15> examined Brown in the infirmary on April 14, 2016.  (Id. at 18–19).  The following day, 
<line: 16> Dr. Clem re-examined Brown and scheduled him for a CT scan at Peninsula Regional 
<line: 17> Medical Center (“PRMC”).  (Id. at 24–25).  Brown was admitted to PRMC later that day.  
<line: 18> (Id. at 26–29). 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> While at PRMC, Brown was diagnosed with a large cystic lesion within the 
<line: 21> pancreatic head, chronic gastritis, and Hepatitis C.  (Id.).  Brown underwent a surgical 
<line: 22> procedure to treat his pancreatic condition.  (Id. at 29).  He was discharged from PRMC 
<line: 23> on April 27, 2016, at which time he was prescribed medicine for pain relief.  (Id.).  Upon 
<line: 24> his release from PRMC, Brown returned to the ECI infirmary.  (Id. at 30–31).  During his 
<line: 25> stay in the infirmary, Brown received instructions for his post-surgery recovery and was 

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 2 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> prescribed medicine for pain relief as necessary.  (Id. at 32, 38–51, 53–57).  Dr. Clem 
<line: 3> evaluated Brown again on April 29, 2016, at which time he extended Brown’s 
<line: 4> prescription for pain medicine to May 4, 2016, and prescribed Brown 600 mg of 
<line: 5> Ibuprofen.  (Id. at 36–37).  Brown returned to the medical department on May 2, 2016, in 
<line: 6> an attempt to obtain some type of pain medication for the “severe pain he was 
<line: 7> experiencing.”  (Compl. at 5).  Dr. Clem evaluated brown in the infirmary at this time, 
<line: 8> and concluded that Brown “was in stable condition and ready to be returned to his 
<line: 9> housing without any conditions.”  (Clem Aff. ¶ 11, ECF No. 17-5).  On May 25, 2016, 
<line: 10> after being seen at the Chronic Care Clinic at ECI, Brown’s pancreatitis was deemed 
<line: 11> resolved.  (Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss Ex. 4 at 62–65). 

[TEXT]
<line: 13> Over the next several months, Brown complained at times of abdominal pain and 
<line: 14> vomiting.  (Id. at 66–105).   At other times, Brown described himself as having a good 
<line: 15> appetite, with no complaints of nausea or vomiting.  (Id. at 71–74, 76).  Brown’s medical 
<line: 16> providers prescribed him various analgesic pain relievers and pancreatic enzymes to 
<line: 17> reduce stomach gasses.  (Id. at 66–105).  Brown was ultimately referred to a 
<line: 18> gastroenterologist for treatment.  (Id. at 98–105).   

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Brown believes he was only prescribed “placebos” instead of pain medication.  
<line: 21> (Brown Aff. ¶ 9, ECF No. 24-1).  As a result, Brown repeatedly requested to be 
<line: 22> prescribed Tramadol.  (Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss Ex. 1 at 71, 80–82).  Brown’s medical 
<line: 23> providers declined to prescribe him Tramadol, however, because of Brown’s history of 
<line: 24> drug abuse, Tramadol’s addictive nature, and the concern over the variety and unverified 
<line: 25> nature of Brown’s symptoms.  (Id. at 72; Clem Aff. ¶ 13, 18).

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Plaintiff filed ARP ECI-2477-16 on November 16, 2016, alleging that Dr. Clem 
<line: 3> failed to refer him to a specialist for post-operative complications and asserting that 
<line: 4> Clem’s conduct constituted deliberate indifference to his medical needs.  (Shumaker 
<line: 5> Decl. at 21, ECF No. 31-5).  Plaintiff withdrew the grievance on December 7, 2016.  (Id. 
<line: 6> at 22).  

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Plaintiff filed ARP ECI-221-17 on January 25, 2017, alleging Nurse Practitioner 
<line: 9> Kerpelman saw him on December 21, 2016 and advised he needed a special diet that was 
<line: 10> not available to ECI; that Dr. Clem would not provide him pain medication; and voiced 
<line: 11> other complaints about the provision of health care.  (Id. at 23–24).  After investigation, 
<line: 12> the grievance was dismissed on February 22, 2107, as Plaintiff’s medical records 
<line: 13> reflected he received appropriate medical care.  (Id. at 29–37).  On November 18, 2016, 
<line: 14> Brown filed the instant complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2018), naming as defendants 
<line: 15> “Dr. Jason Clem, RN Angela Frey, Captain Drummond, RN Vickie, and C/O II Price.”  
<line: 16> (ECF No. 1).4 

[ABANDON]
<line: 18> 4 Brown raises for the first time in his Opposition claims that he has been denied 
<line: 19> treatment for the Hepatitis C virus (HCV).  (Pl.’s Opp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss at 1, 3, ECF 
<line: 20> No. 24).  Brown may not amend his Complaint through his motion briefs.  Zachair, Ltd. 
<line: 21> v. Driggs, 965 F.Supp. 741, 748 n.4 (D.Md. 1997) aff’d, 141 F.3d 1162 (4th Cir. 1998).  
<line: 22> If Plaintiff believes his rights have been violated relative to the treatment of HCV, he 
<line: 23> may file a separate civil rights Complaint naming the appropriate parties and setting forth 
<line: 24> those allegations.

<line: 9> Motion to Dismiss

[TEXT]
<line: 11> "The purpose of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is to test the sufficiency of a complaint,"
<line: 12> not to "resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of
<line: 13> defenses." King y. Rubenstein, 825 F.3d 206, 214 (4th Cir. 2016) (quoting Edwards v.
<line: 14> City of Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 243-44 (4th Cir. 1999)). A complaint fails to state a
<line: 15> claim if it does not contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the
<line: 16> pleader is entitled to relief," Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2), or does not "state a claim to relief that
<line: 17> is plausible on its face," Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl.
<line: 18> Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). A claim is facially plausible "when the
<line: 19> plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that
<line: 20> the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at
<line: 21> 556). "Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere
<line: 22> conclusory statements, do not suffice." Id. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). Though
<line: 23> the plaintiff is not required to forecast evidence to prove the elements of the claim, the
<line: 24> complaint must allege sufficient facts to establish each element. Goss v. Bank of Am.,
<line: 25> N.A., 917 F.Supp.2d 445, 449 (D.Md. 2013) (quoting Walters v. McMahen, 684 F.3d
<line: 26> 435, 439 (4th Cir. 2012)), aff'd sub nom., Goss v. Bank of Am., NA, 546 F.App'x 165
<line: 27> (4th Cir. 2013).

[TEXT]
<line: 29> In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court must examine the complaint as a
<line: 30> whole, consider the factual allegations in the complaint as true, and construe the factual

[ABANDON]
<line: 32> 5

[TEXT]
<line: 2> allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266,
<line: 3> 268 (1994); Lambeth v. Bd. of Comm'rs of Davidson Cty., 407 F.3d 266, 268 (4th Cir.
<line: 4> 2005) (citing Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236 (1974)). But, the court need not
<line: 5> accept unsupported or conclusory factual allegations devoid of any reference to actual
<line: 6> events, United Black Firefighters v. Hirst, 604 F.2d 844, 847 (4th Cir. 1979), or legal
<line: 7> conclusions couched as factual allegations, Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.

[TEXT]
<line: 9> Brown filed his Amended Complaint pro se.  Pro se pleadings are liberally
<line: 10> construed and held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by lawyers.
<line: 11> Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106
<line: 12> (1976)); accord Brown v. N.C. Dep't of Corr., 612 F.3d 720, 722 (4th Cir. 2010). Pro se
<line: 13> complaints are entitled to special care to determine whether any possible set of facts
<line: 14> would entitle the plaintiff to relief. Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 9-10 (1980). But even
<line: 15> a pro se complaint must be dismissed if it does not allege "a plausible claim for relief.

<line: 19> 2.
<line: 20> Conversion to a Motion for Summary Judgment

[TEXT]
<line: 22> In this case, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, for
<line: 23> Summary Judgment. (ECF No. 28). A motion styled as a motion to dismiss or, in the
<line: 24> alternative, for summary judgment implicates the Court's discretion under Rule 12(d).
<line: 25> See Kensington Vol. Fire Dept., Inc. v. Montgomery Cty., 788 F.Supp.2d 431, 436-37
<line: 26> (D.Md. 2011), aff'd sub nom. Kensington Volunteer Fire Dep't, Inc. v. Montgomery
<line: 27> Cty., 684 F.3d 462 (4th Cir. 2012). This Rule provides that when "matters outside the

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> 6

[TEXT]
<line: 2> pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the [Rule 12(b)(6)] motion must 
<line: 3> be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.”  Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d).   

[TEXT]
<line: 5> The Court “has ‘complete discretion to determine whether or not to accept the 
<line: 6> submission of any material beyond the pleadings that is offered in conjunction with a 
<line: 7> Rule 12(b)(6) motion and rely on it, thereby converting the motion, or to reject it or 
<line: 8> simply not consider it.’”  Wells-Bey v. Kopp, No. ELH-12-2319, 2013 WL 1700927, at 
<line: 9> *5 (D.Md. Apr. 16, 2013) (quoting 5C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 
<line: 10> 1366, at 159 (3d ed. 2004, 2012 Supp.)).  The Court’s complete discretion is guided by 
<line: 11> the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit’s two-part test for proper 
<line: 12> conversion of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to a Rule 56 motion.  Under this test, the “parties 
<line: 13> [must] be given some indication by the court that it is treating the 12(b)(6) motion as a 
<line: 14> motion for summary judgment” and “the parties [must] first ‘be afforded a reasonable 
<line: 15> opportunity for discovery.’”  Greater Balt. Ctr. for Pregnancy Concerns, Inc. v. Mayor of 
<line: 16> Balt., 721 F.3d 264, 281 (4th Cir. 2013) (quoting Gay v. Wall, 761 F.2d 175, 177 (4th 
<line: 17> Cir. 1985)).   

[TEXT]
<line: 19> When the movant expressly captions its motion “in the alternative” as one for 
<line: 20> summary judgment and submits matters outside the pleadings for the court’s 
<line: 21> consideration, the parties are deemed to be on notice that conversion under Rule 12(d) 
<line: 22> may occur.  See Moret v. Harvey, 381 F.Supp.2d 458, 464 (D.Md. 2005). 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Here, Defendants caption their Motions in the alternative for summary judgment 
<line: 25> and attach matters beyond Brown’s Complaint for the Court’s consideration.  (ECF No. 
<line: 26> 28).  In response, Brown offers his own matters beyond his Complaint, including two

<line: 2> affidavits.  (See Pl.’s Opp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss Ex. A–E, ECF No. 24-1 through 24-5).  
<line: 3> Thus, the Court will construe Defendants’ Motions as motions for summary judgment. 

[TITLE]
<line: 5> 2.  
<line: 6> Motion for Summary Judgment 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the Court views the facts in a light 
<line: 9> most favorable to the nonmovant, drawing all justifiable inferences in that party’s favor.  
<line: 10> Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 586 (2009); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 
<line: 11> 242, 255 (1986) (citing Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 158–59 (1970)).  
<line: 12> Summary judgment is proper when the movant demonstrates, through “particular parts of 
<line: 13> materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored 
<line: 14> information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations . . . admissions, interrogatory answers, 
<line: 15> or other materials,” that “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the 
<line: 16> movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a), (c)(1)(A).  
<line: 17> Significantly, a party must be able to present the materials it cites in “a form that would 
<line: 18> be admissible in evidence,” Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(2), and supporting affidavits and 
<line: 19> declarations “must be made on personal knowledge” and “set out facts that would be 
<line: 20> admissible in evidence,” Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(4). 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> Once a motion for summary judgment is properly made and supported, the burden 
<line: 23> shifts to the nonmovant to identify evidence showing there is genuine dispute of material 
<line: 24> fact.  See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586–87 
<line: 25> (1986).  The nonmovant cannot create a genuine dispute of material fact “through mere 
<line: 26> speculation or the building of one inference upon another.”  Othentec Ltd. v. Phelan, 526

<line: 7> 465 (4th Cir. 2001) (citing Hooven-Lewis v. Caldera, 249 F.3d 259, 265 (4th Cir. 2001)).
<line: 8> Whether a fact is considered to be "material"' is determined by the substantive law, and
<line: 9> "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing
<line: 10> law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248;.
<line: 11> accord Hooven-Lewis, 249 F.3d at 265. A "genuine' dispute concerning a "material'
<line: 12> fact arises when the evidence is sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to return a verdict in
<line: 13> the nonmoving party's favor. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. If the nonmovant has failed to
<line: 14> make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case where she has the burden
<line: 15> of proof, "there can be 'no genuine [dispute] as to any material fact,' since a complete
<line: 16> failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case
<line: 17> necessarily renders all other facts immaterial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,

<line: 26> State Defendants raise the affirmative defense that Brown has failed to exhaust his.

<line: 2> Litigation Reform Act ("PLRA), 42 U.S.C. s1997e (2018). The PLRA provides in

<line: 5> No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions
<line: 6> under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a

<line: 13> For purposes of the PLRA, "the term *prisoner' means any person incarcerated or.

<line: 15> delinquent for, violations of criminal law or the terms and conditions of parole, probation,
<line: 16> pretrial release, or diversionary program.' 42 U.S.C.  1997e(h). The phrase "prison.

<line: 22> A claim that has not been exhausted may not be considered by this court. See.

<line: 4> administrative review process in accordance with the applicable procedural rules,
<line: 5> including deadlines." Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 88, 93 (2006). This requirement is

<line: 16> prisoners for "inmate complaint resolution." See generally Md. Code Ann. (2008 Repl.
<line: 17> Vol.), Corr. Servs. ("C.S.), ss 10-201 et seq.; Md. Code Regs. ("COMAR')
<line: 18> 12.07.01.01B(1) (defining ARP). The grievance procedure applies to the submission of
<line: 19> "grievance[s] against . . . official[s] or employee[s] of the Division of Correction." C.S.
<line: 20> s 10-206(a).

[TEXT]
<line: 22> Regulations promulgated by DPsCS concerning the administrative remedy
<line: 23> procedure define a "grievance' to include a "complaint of any individual in the custody of
<line: 24> the [DOC] . . . against any officials or employees of the [DOC] . . . arising from the
<line: 25> circumstances of custody or confinement." COMAR 12.07.01.01B(8). An inmate "must

<line: 2> exhaust” the ARP process as a condition precedent to further review of the inmate’s 
<line: 3> grievance.  See C.S. § 10-206(b); see also COMAR 12.07.01.02.D; OPS.185.0002.02. 

[TEXT]
<line: 5> To pursue a grievance, a prisoner confined in a Maryland prison may file a 
<line: 6> grievance with the Inmate Grievance Office (“IGO”) against any DOC official or 
<line: 7> employee. C.S. § 10-206(b).  However, if the prison has a grievance procedure that is 
<line: 8> approved by the IGO, the prisoner must first follow the institutional ARP process, before 
<line: 9> filing a grievance with the IGO.  See C.S. § 10-206(b); see also OPS.185.0002.02.  There 
<line: 10> is an established administrative remedy procedure process that applies to all Maryland 
<line: 11> prisons.  OPS.185.0002.02.  Thus, when the ARP process provides a possible remedy, it 
<line: 12> must be followed and completed before an inmate may file a grievance with the IGO. 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> The ARP process consists of multiple steps.  For the first step, a prisoner is 
<line: 15> required 
<line: 16> to 
<line: 17> file 
<line: 18> his 
<line: 19> initial 
<line: 20> ARP 
<line: 21> with 
<line: 22> his 
<line: 23> facility’s 
<line: 24> “managing 
<line: 25> official”  
<line: 26> OPS.185.0002.05C(1), which is defined by C.S. § 1-101(k) “as the administrator, 
<line: 27> director, warden, superintendent, sheriff, or other individual responsible for the 
<line: 28> management of a correctional facility.”  In the DOC, each facility’s warden is responsible 
<line: 29> for the ARP at the institutional level.  OPS.185.0002.05E.  Moreover, the ARP request 
<line: 30> must be filed within 30 days of the date on which the incident occurred, or within 30 days 
<line: 31> of the date the prisoner first gained knowledge of the incident or injury giving rise to the 
<line: 32> complaint, whichever is later.  OPS.185.0002.05J. 

[TEXT]
<line: 34> The second step in the ARP process occurs if the managing official denies a 
<line: 35> prisoner’s initial ARP.  The prisoner has 30 days to file an appeal with the DPSCS’s 
<line: 36> Deputy Secretary for Operations or that official’s designee.  OPS.185.0002.05L.  For

<line: 2> prisoners in DOC facilities, the Commissioner of Correction is the official to whom this 
<line: 3> appeal is sent.  Id.  

[TEXT]
<line: 5> If the Commissioner of Correction denies an appeal, the prisoner has 30 days to 
<line: 6> file a grievance with the IGO. OPS.185.0002.05D; C.S. § 10-206(a); C.S. § 10-210; 
<line: 7> COMAR 12.07.01.05B.  When filing with the IGO, a prisoner is required to include 
<line: 8> copies of the following: the initial request for administrative remedy, the warden’s 
<line: 9> response to that request, a copy of the ARP appeal filed with the Commissioner of 
<line: 10> Correction, and a copy of the Commissioner’s response.  COMAR 12.07.01.04(B)(9)(a).  
<line: 11> If the grievance is determined to be “wholly lacking in merit on its face,” the IGO may 
<line: 12> dismiss it without a hearing.  C.S. § 10-207(b)(1); see COMAR 12.07.01.07B.  An order 
<line: 13> of dismissal constitutes the final decision of the Secretary of DPSCS for purposes of 
<line: 14> judicial review.  C.S. § 10-207(b)(2)(ii).  However, if a hearing is deemed necessary by 
<line: 15> the IGO, the hearing is conducted by an administrative law judge with the Maryland 
<line: 16> Office of Administrative Hearings.  See C.S. § 10-208(2)(c); COMAR 12.07.01.07-.08.  
<line: 17> The conduct of such hearings is governed by statute.  See C.S. § 10-208; COMAR 
<line: 18> 12.07.01.07D; see also Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t §§ 10-101 et seq.

<line: 2> matter of law. The Court agrees.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> The Eighth Amendment prohibits "unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain' by
<line: 5> virtue of its guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S.
<line: 6> 153, 173 (1976); see also Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 102, (1976). In order to state
<line: 7> an Eighth Amendment claim for denial of medical care, a plaintiff must demonstrate that
<line: 8> the actions of the defendants or their failure to act amounted to deliberate indifference to
<line: 9> a serious medical need. See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. at 106; see also Jackson v.
<line: 10> Lightsey, 775 F.3d 170, 178 (4th Cir. 2014).

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Deliberate indifference to a serious medical need requires proof that, objectively,
<line: 13> the prisoner plaintiff was suffering from a serious medical need and that, subjectively, the
<line: 14> prison staff was aware of the need for medical attention but failed to either provide it or
<line: 15> ensure the needed care was available. See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994).
<line: 16> Objectively, the medical condition at issue must be serious. See Hudson v. McMillian,
<line: 17> 503 U.S. 1, 9 (1992) (there is no expectation that prisoners will be provided with
<line: 18> unqualified access to health care). A ""serious . . . medical need'" is *"one that has been
<line: 19> diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay
<line: 20> person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor's attention.'" Iko v. Shreve, 535
<line: 21> F.3d 225, 241 (4th Cir. 2008) (quoting Henderson v. Sheahan, 196 F.3d 839, 846 (7th
<line: 22> Cir. 1999)).

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Proof of an objectively serious medical condition, however, does not end the
<line: 25> inquiry. The subjective component requires a determination as to whether the defendant
<line: 26> acted with "a sufficiently culpable state of mind." Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298

<line: 2> (1991); see Farmer, 511 U.S. at 839-40.  As the King court reiterated, “[t]he requisite 
<line: 3> state of mind is thus ‘one of deliberate indifference to inmate health or safety.’”  825 F. 
<line: 4> 3d at 219 (citation omitted).  Although this “‘entails more than mere negligence . . . it is 
<line: 5> satisfied by something less than acts or omissions for the very purpose of causing harm or 
<line: 6> with knowledge that harm will result.’”  Id. (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835). 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> In order “[t]o show an Eighth Amendment violation, it is not enough that an 
<line: 9> official should have known of a risk; he or she must have had actual subjective 
<line: 10> knowledge of both the inmate’s serious medical condition and the excessive risk posed 
<line: 11> by the official’s action or inaction.”  Lightsey, 775 F.3d at 178.  In other words, 
<line: 12> deliberate indifference requires a showing that the defendant disregarded a substantial 
<line: 13> risk of harm to the prisoner.  Young v. City of Mt. Ranier, 238 F.3d 567, 575-76 (4th Cir. 
<line: 14> 2001). 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> A plaintiff can meet the subjective knowledge requirement through direct evidence 
<line: 17> of a prison official's actual knowledge or circumstantial evidence tending to establish 
<line: 18> such knowledge, including evidence “that a prison official knew of a substantial risk from 
<line: 19> the very fact that the risk was obvious.”  Makdessi v. Fields, 789 F.3d 126, 133 (4th Cir. 
<line: 20> 2015) (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842).   

[TEXT]
<line: 22> For medical care providers, “any negligence or malpractice on the part of the 
<line: 23> doctors in missing [a] diagnosis does not, by itself, support an inference of deliberate 
<line: 24> indifference.”  Johnson v. Quinones, 145 F.3d 164, 166 (4th Cir. 1998).  Without 
<line: 25> evidence that a doctor linked presence of symptoms with a diagnosis of a serious medical 
<line: 26> condition, the subjective knowledge required for Eighth Amendment liability is not

<line: 2> present. Id. at 169 (actions inconsistent with an effort to hide a serious medical
<line: 3> condition, refutes presence of doctor's subjective knowledge).

[TEXT]
<line: 5> In essence, the treatment rendered must be so grossly incompetent or inadequate
<line: 6> as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness. Miltier v. Beorn,
<line: 7> 896 F.2d 848, 851 (4th Cir. 1990) (citation omitted) (overruled in part on other grounds
<line: 8> by Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837; aff'd in pertinent part by Sharpe v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 621
<line: 9> Fed. Appx. 732 (Mem) (4th Cir. 2015)). A prisoner's disagreement with a prescribed
<line: 10> course of treatment is not enough to establish deliberate indifference. See Peterson v.
<line: 11> Davis, 551 F.Supp. 137, 146 (D.Md. 1982), aff'd, 729 F.2d 1453 (4th Cir. 1984). And,
<line: 12> the right to treatment is *limited to that which may be provided upon a reasonable cost
<line: 13> and time basis and the essential test is one of medical necessity and not simply that which
<line: 14> may be considered merely desirable." Bowring y. Godwin, 551 F.2d 44, 47-48 (4th Cir.
<line: 15> 1977) (emphasis added).

[TEXT]
<line: 17> Medical Defendants admit Brown suffers from pancreatic disease, but assert his
<line: 18> condition has been carefully monitored and treated. Although pancreatic disease
<line: 19> constitutes a serious medical need sufficient to satisfy the objective component of an
<line: 20> Eighth Amendment analysis, Brown failed to offer sufficient evidence that the Medical
<line: 21> Defendants' conduct rose to the level of deliberate indifference.

<line: 2> acute pancreatitis and thereafter was provided with the appropriate conservative follow-
<line: 3> up care to treat his condition.  While Brown experienced pain and frustration with the 
<line: 4> delay in his recovery, the parties do not dispute that his complaints were considered, he 
<line: 5> was provided additional medication, counselling, blood work, and diagnostic testing in an 
<line: 6> effort to treat his condition.  And though Brown disputes how quickly he was given 
<line: 7> treatment or the severity of his post-operation symptoms, Brown’s deliberate indifference 
<line: 8> claim amounts to little more than a disagreement with the course of treatment prescribed, 
<line: 9> which is insufficient to establish deliberate indifference.  See Peterson, 551 F.Supp. at 
<line: 10> 146. 

[TEXT]
<line: 12> The Court, therefore, concludes that Brown fails to offer sufficient evidence to
