<line: 12> The following evidence has been presented in 
<line: 13> connection with the instant Motion.  In 1986, Plaintiff’s family 
<line: 14> began developing two separate houses on the property located at 
<line: 15> 952 Paipala Place, in Makawao, Hawai`i (“the Property”).  
<line: 16> [Defs.’ Concise Statement of Facts in Supp. of Motion for 
<line: 17> Summary Judgment (“Defs.’ CSOF”), filed 8/28/20 (dkt. no. 126), 
<line: 18> at ¶ 1.2]  On March 7, 2007, Plaintiff’s father, Macario Araujo 
<line: 19> Chavez (“M.A. Chavez”), obtained a $650,000 loan from American 
<line: 20> Home Mortgage, secured by a mortgage on the Property (“the Loan” 

[ABANDON]
<line: 22> 2 Plaintiff did not file a responsive concise statement of 
<line: 23> fact to Defendants’ CSOF with his memorandum in opposition.  
<line: 24> Plaintiff’s concise statement of facts (“Plaintiff’s CSOF”) - 
<line: 25> which was attached to his memorandum in opposition and not filed 
<line: 26> as a separate document - only asserts what he believes to be the 
<line: 27> undisputed facts of the case; he did not specifically admit or 
<line: 28> deny each of the facts listed in Defendants’ CSOF.  See Pltf.’s 
<line: 29> CSOF, dkt. no. 134-1.  On October 5, 2020, Plaintiff filed a 
<line: 30> request for leave to file a responsive concise statement, but 
<line: 31> that request was denied in an October 15, 2020 entering order.  
<line: 32> [Dkt. nos. 138, 140.]  Thus, pursuant to Local Rule 56.1(g), the 
<line: 33> statements of material facts set forth in Defendants’ CSOF are 
<line: 34> deemed admitted, unless they are controverted by statements in 
<line: 35> Plaintiff’s CSOF.

[TEXT]
<line: 10> When he obtained the Loan, M.A. Chavez certified that 
<line: 11> he would occupy the Property as his “principal residence,” as

<line: 13> required under the terms of the Loan.  Defs.’ CSOF at ¶¶ 3-4; 
<line: 14> see also Torres Decl., Exh. C (Occupancy Certification), Exh. D 
<line: 15> (Occupancy Agreement).  M.A. Chavez also acknowledged that the 
<line: 16> failure to use the Property as his primary residence would 
<line: 17> constitute a default.  [Defs.’ CSOF at ¶ 4.]  Plaintiff asserts 
<line: 18> M.A. Chavez complied with the Occupancy Agreement and “did live 
<line: 19> [at the Property] until his death in 2010 and he considered 
<line: 20> Hawaii his home.”  [Pltf.’s CSOF at ¶ 9 (citing Pltf.’s CSOF, 
<line: 21> Aff. of Luis C. Chavez (“Pltf. Aff.”) at ¶ 6).]  Defendants 
<line: 22> dispute this, pointing to Plaintiff’s deposition testimony that 
<line: 23> California was his parents’ primary residence and to M.A. 
<line: 24> Chavez’s death certificate, which listed an Orange County

<line: 11> Plaintiff asserts he is the borrower in the Loan, 
<line: 12> having assumed the liability for the Mortgage and the underlying 
<line: 13> promissory note (“the Note”) since 2007.  He states his payments 
<line: 14> were accepted without objection.  Plaintiff asserts Defendants 
<line: 15> were aware that he had assumed the Mortgage, as evidenced by the 
<line: 16> fact that the assumption was discussed and agreed to during the 
<line: 17> loan modification process.  [Pltf.’s CSOF at ¶¶ 1-3 (citing 
<line: 18> Pltf. Aff. at ¶ 2).]  Defendants dispute this, stating no loan 
<line: 19> assumption agreement was ever entered into, and they point out 
<line: 20> that the Mortgage payments came from a joint bank account shared 
<line: 21> by Plaintiff and M.A. Chavez, not necessarily from Plaintiff

<line: 8> Plaintiff states that, on November 17, 2008, he 
<line: 9> notified AHMSI, in writing, that he held title to the Property.

<line: 11> dated 11/17/08 to AHMSI from Pltf.)).]  Defendants state this is 
<line: 12> “[p]artially disputed” because Plaintiff’s letter did not

<line: 14> M.A. Chavez did not obtain lender consent prior to the transfer.

<line: 5> Plaintiff points out that he entered into the loan modification 
<line: 6> agreement, dated March 1, 2009, using M.A. Chavez’s power of

<line: 8> also states one of Defendants’ agents, Matt Palmer, had personal 
<line: 9> knowledge that Plaintiff was going to be responsible for the

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Defendants state that, “[o]n May 1, 2007, the 
<line: 9> beneficial interest in the Loan was transferred to Deutsche Bank 
<line: 10> as Trustee,” and M.A. Chavez was not in default at that time.

<line: 12> this but does not cite supporting evidence.  He merely states: 
<line: 13> “No transfer took place.”  [Pltf.’s CSOF at ¶ 9.] 
<line: 14> It is undisputed that the following events took place:  
<line: 15> -on August 13, 2008, AHMSI sent M.A. Chavez a written notice of 
<line: 16> default;

<line: 20> Plaintiff states he made the repairs himself before the claims 
<line: 21> were paid by the insurance company.  When the checks were

<line: 10> Court cannot disregard Plaintiff’s statements “solely based on

<line: 14> See Nigro v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 784 F.3d 495, 497 (9th Cir.

<line: 17> disregarded, Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence 
<line: 18> raising a genuine issue of fact for trial regarding the question

<line: 25> purposes of the instant case, this Court will assume that the 
<line: 26> Assignments are valid.  Further, because Plaintiff’s argument

<line: 11> Defendants also assert M.A. Chavez and the Estate

<line: 14> within thirty days.  [Id., Exh. 21 (Annual Escrow Account

<line: 5> The April 19, 2010 letter was returned to the sender

<line: 7> letter was returned, marked “NOT DELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED UNABLE 
<line: 8> TO FORWARD.”  [Torres Decl., Exhs. Q, R.]  However, both letters 
<line: 9> were addressed to the Property, where it is undisputed that 
<line: 10> Plaintiff has lived at all times relevant to this case.  See 
<line: 11> Nakashima Decl., Exh. A (Pltf. Depo. vol. II) at 234.]  During 
<line: 12> that period, Plaintiff was acting on M.A. Chavez’s behalf, 
<line: 13> pursuant to a power of attorney.  See, e.g., Pltf. Aff., Exh. 1 
<line: 14> at PageID #: 1248.  Even viewing the record in the light most 
<line: 15> favorable to Plaintiff, he ignored or refused to accept the 
<line: 16> default notice letters.  This is insufficient to rebut the 
<line: 17> strong presumption that Plaintiff, acting on M.A. Chavez’s 
<line: 18> behalf, received the default notice letters.  Plaintiff’s own 
<line: 19> evidence shows that he was aware of problems with M.A. Chavez’s 
<line: 20> Loan account.  The June 27, 2011 letter from AHMSI to

<line: 6> that M.A. Chavez’s Loan account was in default. 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Even if the default reflected in the February 18, 2011 
<line: 9> notice letter is not considered, the $12,263.76 would only have

<line: 14> Under either scenario, by some time in 2011, the 
<line: 15> Estate breached the Loan contract by failing to make the

<line: 17> taxes and insurance [for the Property] since February 2012,” 
<line: 18> [Pltf. Aff. at ¶ 14,] i.e., he has not made the Mortgage 
<line: 19> payments.  Thus, there are no genuine issues of material fact as 
<line: 20> to Count III, and this Court concludes, as a matter of law, that 
<line: 21> the Estate’s breach of the Loan contract precludes Plaintiff as 
<line: 22> Administrator from pursuing a breach of contract claim against 
<line: 23> Defendants.  See Furuya, 137 Hawai`i at 385–86, 375 P.3d at 164–

<line: 5> No. 13-00502 DKW-RLP, 2017 WL 561338 at *5 (D. Hawai`i Feb. 10, 
<line: 6> 2017) (citing Yoneji)).  This Court need not decide which line 
<line: 7> of cases to follow because the conversion claim in this case 
<line: 8> fails under either analysis. 

[TEXT]
<line: 10> If an actual or constructive intent to injure the 
<line: 11> Estate or Plaintiff as Administrator is required, Plaintiff has 
<line: 12> failed to identify any evidence which raises a genuine issue of 
<line: 13> fact as to the existence of such an intent.  Even if all that is 
<line: 14> required is an intent to deal with the funds in a manner that 
<line: 15> was inconsistent with the rights of the Estate, Plaintiff has 
<line: 16> still failed to identify sufficient evidence to create a triable 
<line: 17> issue of fact.  The Mortgage specifically directs the manner in 
<line: 18> which payments received are to be applied to the Loan account.

<line: 21> Application of Payments or Proceeds.  

[TEXT]
<line: 23> Except as otherwise described in this Section 2, 
<line: 24> all payments accepted and applied by Lender shall 
<line: 25> be applied in the following order of priority: 
<line: 26> (a) interest due under the Note; (b) principal 
<line: 27> due under the Note; (c) amounts due under 
<line: 28> Section 3.  Such payments shall be applied to 
<line: 29> each Periodic Payment in the order in which it 
<line: 30> became due.  Any remaining amounts shall be 
<line: 31> applied first to late charges, second to any 
<line: 32> other amounts due under this Security Instrument, 
<line: 33> and then to reduce the principal balance of the 
<line: 34> Note.

<line: 36> If Lender receives a payment from Borrower 
<line: 37> for a delinquent Periodic Payment which includes 
<line: 38> a sufficient amount to pay any late charge due, 
<line: 39> the payment may be applied to the delinquent 
<line: 40> payment and the late charge.  If more than one

<line: 6> extent that, each payment can be paid in full.  
<line: 7> To the extent that any excess exists after the 
<line: 8> payment is applied to the full payment of one or 
<line: 9> more Periodic Payments, such excess may be 
<line: 10> applied to any late charges due.  Voluntary 
<line: 11> prepayments shall be applied first to any 
<line: 12> prepayment charges and then as described in the 
<line: 13> Note. 

[TEXT]
<line: 15> [Torres Decl., Exh. I at 4 (emphasis in original).]  Section 1 
<line: 16> of the Mortgage allows the Lender, at its discretion, to accept 
<line: 17> or return a partial payment that is insufficient to bring the 
<line: 18> account current.  [Id.]  Further, the lender is not required to 
<line: 19> apply such funds as soon as they are accepted, and it “may hold 
<line: 20> such unapplied funds until Borrower makes payment to bring the 
<line: 21> Loan current.  If Borrower does not do so within a reasonable 
<line: 22> period of time, Lender shall either apply such funds or return 
<line: 23> them to Borrower.”  [Id.]   

[TEXT]
<line: 25> Even construing the evidence in the light most 
<line: 26> favorable to Plaintiff, the alleged surplus funds were applied 
<line: 27> to various charges related to the Mortgage, consistent with the 
<line: 28> provisions above.  See, e.g., Pltf. Aff., Exh. 18 (5/17/10 
<line: 29> letter from AHMSI discussing the suspense account and when some 
<line: 30> monies from the account was applied), Exh. 19 (6/27/11 letter 
<line: 31> from AHMSI discussing application of funds from the restricted 
<line: 32> escrow account and the suspense account).  Plaintiff has 
<line: 33> therefore failed to raise genuine issue of fact as to the 
<line: 34> question of whether Defendants acted with an intent to deal with

[TEXT]
<line: 5> the alleged surplus payments in a manner that was inconsistent 
<line: 6> with the property rights of the Estate.  Under either theory of 
<line: 7> the intent required for a conversion claim, Plaintiff as 
<line: 8> Administrator has failed to show that there is a genuine issue 
<line: 9> of fact for trial.  Because Count V fails as a matter of law, 
<line: 10> Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as to that claim.

<line: 12> D. 
<line: 13> Quiet Title 

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Plaintiff as Administrator seeks to quiet title 
<line: 16> because “Defendants have fraudulently and without proper 
<line: 17> authority encumbered the Property.”  [Third Amended Complaint at 
<line: 18> pg. 27.]  The Hawai`i Supreme Court has stated: 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> In an action to quiet title, the burden is 
<line: 21> on the plaintiff to prove title in and to the 
<line: 22> land in dispute, and, absent such proof, it is 
<line: 23> unnecessary for the defendant to make any 
<line: 24> showing.  State v. Zimring, 58 Haw. 106, 110, 566 
<line: 25> P.2d 725, 729 (1977) (citations omitted).  The 
<line: 26> plaintiff has the burden to prove either that he 
<line: 27> has paper title to the property or that he holds 
<line: 28> title by adverse possession.  Hustace v. Jones, 2 
<line: 29> Haw. App. 234, 629 P.2d 1151 (1981); see also 
<line: 30> Harrison v. Davis, 22 Haw. 51, 54 (1914).  While 
<line: 31> it is not necessary for the plaintiff to have 
<line: 32> perfect title to establish a prima facie case, he 
<line: 33> must at least prove that he has a substantial 
<line: 34> interest in the property and that his title is 
<line: 35> superior to that of the defendants.  Shilts v. 
<line: 36> Young, 643 P.2d 686, 689 (Alaska 1981). . . .

<line: 9> E. 
<line: 10> RESPA 

[TEXT]
<line: 12> In Count XI, Plaintiff as Administrator alleges he or 
<line: 13> his then-attorney sent AHMSI and/or Ocwen “at least four” 
<line: 14> letters that constitute QWRs, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 
<line: 15> § 2605(e)(1)(B), but they failed to either take action within 
<line: 16> sixty days or provide a written response within twenty days.  
<line: 17> [Third Amended Complaint at ¶¶ 153-54.]  Plaintiff also alleges 
<line: 18> AHMSI and/or Ocwen have violated § 2605(g) and (k) by wrongfully 
<line: 19> withholding his money.  [Id. at ¶ 157.]  Further, he asserts 
<line: 20> AHMSI and/or Ocwen wrongfully imposed unwarranted charges and 
<line: 21> fees and misapplied payments, as reflected in Ocwen’s Affidavit 
<line: 22> of Debt, which was filed in a state court foreclosure action on 
<line: 23> June 23, 2017.  [Id. at ¶ 155.]

<line: 26> QWRs 

[TEXT]
<line: 28> Defendants have submitted evidence that neither 
<line: 29> M.A. Chavez nor anyone acting on his behalf submitted a QWR 
<line: 30> regarding his Loan.  See Torres Decl. at ¶ 20 (stating she is 
<line: 31> unaware of any QWR regarding the Loan), ¶ 21 (stating that, 
<line: 32> based on her experience, knowledge of industry-wide standards,

<line: 5> accurate).  Thus, Defendants have carried their burden of 
<line: 6> production and persuasion as to this portion of Count XI. 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Plaintiff’s position that he submitted four QWRs is 
<line: 9> purportedly evidenced by the contents of his Exhibit 12.  See 
<line: 10> Pltf. Aff. at ¶ 14.  Exhibit 12 is a collection of documents,

<line: 19> The one letter from Plaintiff as Administrator in Exhibit 12

<line: 22> Exhibit 12 which are addressed to the Estate show that someone, 
<line: 23> acting on the Estate’s behalf, sent an inquiry about the Loan, 
<line: 24> but the letters to the Estate do not contain enough information 
<line: 25> about the original inquiries to show that any of them 
<line: 26> constituted a QWR.  Because Plaintiff as Administrator has 
<line: 27> failed to present any evidence indicating that he sent a QWR 
<line: 28> regarding the Loan, the portion of Count XI alleging a failure 
<line: 29> to act upon or respond to a QWR fails as a matter of law.

<line: 15> Plaintiff as Administrator failed to identify any evidence

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Plaintiff as Administrator has failed to present any evidence of 
<line: 21> a violation of subsections (A), (B), (D), or (E).  Because this 
<line: 22> case generally asserts Defendants misapplied various payments 
<line: 23> made toward the Loan, this portion of Count XI appears to rely 
<line: 24> on subsection (C).  However, Plaintiff as Administrator failed 
<line: 25> to present evidence of when he specifically requested that AHMSI 
<line: 26> and/or Ocwen correct errors regarding allocation of payments.  
<line: 27> There is evidence that inquiries were made and responded to.  
<line: 28> See, e.g., Pltf. Aff., Exh. 18 (5/17/10 letter to M.A. Chavez

<line: 30> letter dated 6/27/11).  Without evidence of when the initiating 
<line: 31> correspondence was sent, Plaintiff as Administrator has failed 
<line: 32> to show a lack of timely response by AHMSI.  He therefore cannot 
<line: 33> establish a violation of § 2605(k)(1)(C), and the portion of

<line: 17> Paragraph 21 of the Third Amended Complaint alleges 
<line: 18> AHMSI did not have authority to enter into the Loan Modification 
<line: 19> Agreement.  See also Pltf. Aff., Exh. 2 (Loan Modification 
<line: 20> Agreement).  This alleged UDAP violation is premised upon the 
<line: 21> alleged invalidity of the 2008 Assignment.  See also Third 
<line: 22> Amended Complaint at ¶¶ 24-25 (allegations regarding the 2008 
<line: 23> Assignment); Torres Decl., Exh. E (2008 Assignment).  For the 
<line: 24> reasons stated supra Discussion Section I, Plaintiff 
<line: 25> Individually cannot challenge the 2008 Assignment.  These

[TEXT]
<line: 30> Paragraph 22 of the Third Amended Complaint alleges 
<line: 31> that, on or about March 18, 2009, Defendants made an 
<line: 32> unauthorized $24,072.85 charge to the Loan account, but 
<line: 33> Plaintiff did not discover it until 2017.  Because Plaintiff

[TEXT]
<line: 5> the allegedly unauthorized charge occurred beyond the four-year 
<line: 6> limitations period.  See 5/31/19 Oder, 2019 WL 2330885, at *1 
<line: 7> (discussing proceedings in the state court).  Plaintiff has not 
<line: 8> presented sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact 
<line: 9> as to whether the unauthorized charge was part of a continuing 
<line: 10> violation or whether Defendants fraudulently concealed the 
<line: 11> violation.  The portion of the UDAP claim based on the allegedly 
<line: 12> unauthorized charge is therefore time-barred. 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> Paragraphs 33 to 37.f and 47 to 48 of the Third 
<line: 15> Amended Complaint address the alleged failure to properly apply 
<line: 16> payments toward the Loan in 2010 and 2011.  The fraudulent 
<line: 17> concealment doctrine does not apply because Plaintiff knew that 
<line: 18> he submitted payments, and he knew or should have known whether 
<line: 19> those payments were applied to the Loan account.  Plaintiff has 
<line: 20> not presented any evidence suggesting that the alleged failures 
<line: 21> to apply payments toward the Loan account were part of a 
<line: 22> violation that continued into the limitations period.  

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Therefore, the portion of the UDAP claim based on the alleged 
<line: 25> failure to properly apply payments in 2010 and 2011 accrued when 
<line: 26> the payments were processed, and Plaintiff Individually failed 
<line: 27> to bring the claim within the four-year limitation period.

<line: 29> Paragraph 50 of the Third Amended Complaint relates to

<line: 5> to an April 7, 2011 notice of acceleration that also refers to 
<line: 6> the foreclosure.  Paragraph 53 relates to the same letter and 
<line: 7> notice.  Plaintiff has not presented evidence regarding the 
<line: 8> letters described in paragraphs 50, 51, and 53.  These portions 
<line: 9> of the UDAP claim therefore fail as a matter of law, and it is 
<line: 10> unnecessary to address the remainder of Defendants’ arguments as

[TEXT]
<line: 13> Paragraphs 65 to 68 of the Third Amended Complaint 
<line: 14> relate to Deutsche Bank’s recording of documents in 2011 in 
<line: 15> connection with the foreclosure of the Property.  Plaintiff 
<line: 16> alleges the recording of the documents and the initiation of the 
<line: 17> foreclosure proceedings constituted UDAP violations because 
<line: 18> Deutsche Bank did not hold valid title to the Property, due to 
<line: 19> the defect in the 2008 Assignment.  For the reasons stated supra 
<line: 20> Discussion Section I, this argument fails.  Therefore the 
<line: 21> portions of the UDAP claim based on the allegations in 
<line: 22> paragraphs 65 to 68 fail as a matter of law, and it unnecessary 
<line: 23> to address the remainder of Defendants’ arguments as to those 
<line: 24> portions of the UDAP claim.

<line: 8> Even if Plaintiff could establish an underlying physical injury

<line: 11> Hawai`i case law and § 663-8.9, the physical injury suffered by 
<line: 12> the claimant must have been caused “by the defendant’s 
<line: 13> conduct”).  Because Plaintiff Individually cannot establish a

<line: 18> CONCLUSION 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ Motion for 
<line: 21> Summary Judgment, filed August 28, 2020, is HEREBY GRANTED, and 
<line: 22> summary judgment is granted in favor of Defendants as to all of 
<line: 23> Plaintiff’s claims in the Third Amended Complaint, filed 
<line: 24> December 4, 2019.  There being no remaining claims in this case, 
<line: 25> the Clerk’s Office is DIRECTED to enter judgment in favor of 
<line: 26> Defendants on December 15, 2020, unless Plaintiff files a timely 
<line: 27> motion for reconsideration of this Order. 

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> 22 In light of this ruling, it is not necessary to address 
<line: 30> the statute of limitations issue and the other issues raised 
<line: 31> regarding the NIED claim.
