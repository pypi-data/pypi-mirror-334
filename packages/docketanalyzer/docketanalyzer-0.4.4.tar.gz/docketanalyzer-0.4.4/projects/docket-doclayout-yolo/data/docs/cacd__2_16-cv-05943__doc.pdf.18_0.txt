<line: 39> DAVID WESLEY TAYLOR,
<line: 40> Petitioner,
<line: 41> v.
<line: 42> RANDY TEWS, Warden, 
<line: 43> Defendants.

[TEXT]
<line: 45> The Court grants the government’s unopposed motion to dismiss this federal 
<line: 46> habeas action.

<line: 50> Petitioner formerly was a federal prisoner at the prison facility in 
<line: 51> Victorville.1  He filed a habeas action (28 U.S.C. § 2241) challenging the decision 
<line: 52> of the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to impose discipline against him.  
<line: 53> Petitioner was found to have violated a prison rule by allowing another inmate to

<line: 56> Shortly after filing the action, the BOP transferred Petitioner to a 
<line: 57> federal prison in Arkansas.  Petitioner failed to update the Court with his new 
<line: 58> address as required under Local Rule.  (Docket # 15, 16.)

<line: 4> use his telephone account.  The penalty imposed on Petitioner consisted of a loss of 
<line: 5> 27 days of good time credit, a suspended period of segregation, and the loss of 
<line: 6> other privileges.  (Docket # 8 at 4.) 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> The government moved to dismiss the action.  (Id.)  The government argued 
<line: 9> that Petitioner failed to exhaust his claim administratively and did not properly 
<line: 10> appeal the adverse decision with the BOP.  Additionally, because the BOP recently 
<line: 11> ssued an amended order to correctly identify the name of an agency employee 
<line: 12> nvolved in the original decision, the government contends that Petitioner’s federal 
<line: 13> action is not ripe.  (Id. at 8.) 

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Petitioner filed an abbreviated response to the dismissal motion.  (Docket 
<line: 16> # 11.)  Although entitled “opposition to motion to dismiss and request stay until 
<line: 17> adm. [sic] remedy complete,” the gist of Petitioner’s submission was to request 
<line: 18> that the Court order a variety of relief against the BOP.  In other contemporaneous 
<line: 19> filings, Petitioner asked for an indefinite stay of the federal case and the 
<line: 20> appointment of a lawyer.  (Docket # 10, 13.)   

[TEXT]
<line: 22> Magistrate Judge Wilner issued several orders denying the requests.  
<line: 23> (Docket # 12, 14, 16.)  Judge Wilner noted that Petitioner offered no evidence or 
<line: 24> cogent argument as to why either a stay or appointment of a lawyer was necessary.  
<line: 25> The Court also observed that Petitioner’s “‘opposition’ to the motion to dismiss 
<line: 26> gnored the substance of the government’s argument.”  (Docket # 12 at 1.)  The 
<line: 27> Court extended the deadline by which Petitioner was to submit “a coherent 
<line: 28> response” to the motion several times.  (Docket # 12, 16.)  However, Petitioner 
<line: 29> ultimately did not file any opposition to the government’s exhaustion argument.

<line: 34> Local Rule of Court 7-12 states that, after a party files a motion with 
<line: 35> the Court, the failure to file a required response “may be deemed consent to the 
<line: 36> granting [ ] of the motion.”  That rule applies to the present dismissal motion.  The

[TEXT]
<line: 4> government plausibly established that Petitioner failed to exhaust his claims 
<line: 5> properly within the BOP before seeking federal habeas relief.  Despite several 
<line: 6> warnings, Petitioner did not file a response that addressed the government’s 
<line: 7> argument.  Petitioner’s failure to respond to the dismissal motion signifies his 
<line: 8> consent to the dismissal of the action. 

[TEXT]
<line: 10> 2. 
<line: 11> Dismissal is also proper under Rule 41(b).  Rule 41(b) provides that if 
<line: 12> a plaintiff “fails to prosecute or to comply with these rules or a court order, a 
<line: 13> defendant may move to dismiss the action or any claim against it.”  Dismissal may 
<line: 14> be ordered by the Court sua sponte. Link v. Wabash R.R., 370 U.S. 626, 629-30 
<line: 15> (1962).  Dismissal of a civil action under Rule 41 may be appropriate to advance 
<line: 16> the public’s interest in the expeditious resolution of litigation, the court’s need to 
<line: 17> manage its docket, and to avoid the risk of prejudice to defendants.  Omstead v. 
<line: 18> Dell, Inc., 594 F.3d 1081, 1084 (9th Cir. 2010); Ferdik v. Bonzelet, 963 F.2d 1258, 
<line: 19> 1263 (9th Cir. 1992) (analyzing factors supporting dismissal of Section 1983 
<line: 20> actions).

[TEXT]
<line: 22> Petitioner’s failure to prosecute this action warrants dismissal under 
<line: 23> Rule 41(b).  Petitioner failed to respond to the government’s dismissal motion and 
<line: 24> the Court’s order requiring him to do so.  (Docket # 12, 14, 16.)  The public, the 
<line: 25> Court, and the government have a significant interest in the resolution of this case.  
<line: 26> Petitioner, by contrast, has demonstrated a lack of interest in pursuing the action to 
<line: 27> a decision on the merits.  Moreover, given Petitioner’s failure to respond to the 
<line: 28> Court’s order, there are no “less drastic sanctions” available to the Court other than 
<line: 29> a dismissal of the action.  Omstead, 594 F.3d at 1084.  Rule 41 therefore provides 
<line: 30> an additional basis for dismissing the action.

<line: 32> 3. 
<line: 33> Finally, were the Court to reach the merits of the government’s 
<line: 34> dismissal motion, it is apparent that Petitioner is not entitled to relief.  Federal 
<line: 35> prisoners generally must exhaust their administrative remedies before filing a

[TEXT]
<line: 4> federal habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241.  Martinez v. Roberts, 804 F.2d 
<line: 5> 570, 571 (9th Cir. 1986); Jiau v. Poole, 590 F. App’x 689, 690 (9th Cir. 2015).  A 
<line: 6> district court has discretion to dismiss an unexhausted § 2241 petition without 
<line: 7> prejudice, or excuse the requirement and reach the merits.  Jiau, 590 F. App’x at 
<line: 8> 690; Pavlovich v. Johnson, No. CV 16-749 PSG (SS), 2016 WL 3410195 at *2 
<line: 9> (C.D. Cal. 2016).  However, a court’s discretion to excuse the failure to exhaust is 
<line: 10> imited to situations where administrative remedies are inadequate or ineffective, 
<line: 11> pursuing them would be futile, or irreparable injury would result.  Pavlovich, 2016 
<line: 12> WL 3410195 at *2; Laing v. Ashcroft, 370 F.3d 994, 1000-01 (9th Cir. 2004).

[TEXT]
<line: 14> Petitioner’s claim for relief is unexhausted.  The government convincingly 
<line: 15> demonstrates that Petitioner did not properly seek administrative review of the 
<line: 16> adverse disciplinary ruling before initiating this federal action.  (Docket # 11 
<line: 17> at 5-7.)  Further, after the filing of the action, the government corrected a minor 
<line: 18> error in the hearing decision; this reopened Petitioner’s ability to present his claims 
<line: 19> administratively.  (Id. at 8.)  He has not done so, though.  The Court therefore has 
<line: 20> no basis to exercise its discretion to excuse Petitioner’s failure to exhaust.  Laing, 
<line: 21> 370 F.3d at 1000-01.
