[TITLE]
<line: 18> Michael H. Simon, District Judge. 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Plaintiff moves for attorney fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (“EAJA”), 28 
<line: 21> U.S.C. § 2412. Defendant objects, arguing that her position was substantially justified and thus 
<line: 22> EAJA fees are not warranted. For the reasons discussed below, the Court grants Plaintiff’s 
<line: 23> motion and awards EAJA fees in the amount of $6,809.24. 

[TITLE]
<line: 25> EAJA STANDARD 

[TEXT]
<line: 27> The EAJA authorizes the payment of attorney’s fees to a prevailing party in an action 
<line: 28> against the United States, unless the government shows that its position in the underlying 
<line: 29> litigation “was substantially justified.” 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A). Although EAJA creates a 
<line: 30> presumption that fees will be awarded to a prevailing party, Congress did not intend fee shifting 
<line: 31> to be mandatory. Flores v. Shalala, 49 F.3d 562, 567 (9th Cir. 1995). The decision to deny EAJA 
<line: 32> attorney’s fees is within the discretion of the court. Id.; Lewis v. Barnhart, 281 F.3d 1081, 1083

<line: 2> (9th Cir. 2002). A social security claimant is the “prevailing party” following a sentence-four 
<line: 3> remand pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) either for further administrative proceedings or for the 
<line: 4> payment of benefits. Flores, 49 F.3d at 567-68 (citing Shalala v. Schaefer, 509 U.S. 292, 300 
<line: 5> (1993)). Fee awards under the EAJA are paid to the litigant, and not the litigant’s attorney, 
<line: 6> unless the litigant has assigned his or her rights to counsel to receive the fee award. Astrue v. 
<line: 7> Ratliff, 560 U.S. 586, 596-98 (2010). 

[TEXT]
<line: 9> A court applies a reasonableness standard in determining whether the government’s 
<line: 10> position was substantially justified. Flores, 49 F.3d at 569. “The government has the burden of 
<line: 11> proving its positions were substantially justified.” Hardisty v. Astrue, 592 F.3d 1072, 1076 n.2 
<line: 12> (9th Cir. 2010). It must demonstrate that its position had a reasonable basis in both law and fact. 
<line: 13> Flores, 49 F.3d at 569-70. The reasonableness standard is met if the government’s position is 
<line: 14> “justified in substance or in the main” or “to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.” 
<line: 15> Gutierrez v. Barnhart, 274 F.3d 1255, 1258 (9th Cir. 2001) (quotations and citation omitted); 
<line: 16> Lewis, 281 F.3d at 1083. The government must justify both the original agency action and its 
<line: 17> litigation position. Gutierrez, 274 F.3d at 1259.  

[TEXT]
<line: 19> The government’s failure to prevail in its position on the underlying issues is not 
<line: 20> dispositive of the issue of whether the government’s position was “substantially justified.” See, 
<line: 21> e.g., Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 569 (1988) (“Conceivably, the Government could take 
<line: 22> a position that is not substantially justified, yet win; even more likely, it could take a position 
<line: 23> that is substantially justified, yet lose.”). A district court’s reversal of the ALJ’s decision, 
<line: 24> however, is a strong indication that the government’s defense of that decision was not 
<line: 25> substantially justified. See Thangaraja v. Gonzales, 428 F.3d 870, 874 (9th Cir. 2005) (“Our 
<line: 26> holding that the agency’s decision of [this] case was unsupported by substantial evidence is 

[ABANDON]
<line: 28> PAGE 2 – ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> therefore a strong indication that the position of the United States in this matter was not 
<line: 3> substantially justified. Indeed, it will be only a decidedly unusual case in which there is 
<line: 4> substantial justification under the EAJA even though the agency’s decision was reversed as 
<line: 5> lacking in reasonable, substantial and probative evidence in the record.”) (internal quotations 
<line: 6> omitted). 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Under the EAJA, if the government’s position is not substantially justified, the court has 
<line: 9> discretion to determine whether the requested fees are reasonable. See Comm’r, INS v. Jean, 496 
<line: 10> U.S. 154, 160-61 (1990) (the court has similar discretion under the EAJA to determine the 
<line: 11> reasonableness of fees as it does under the Fees Act as described in Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 
<line: 12> U.S. 424, 436-37 (1983)); Atkins v. Apfel, 154 F.3d 986, 989 (9th Cir. 1998) (discussing the Jean 
<line: 13> clarification that the Hensley analysis applies to EAJA cases). One factor a court must consider 
<line: 14> in this analysis is the results obtained. See Atkins, 154 F.3d at 989 (the results obtained factor of 
<line: 15> the Hensley fee analysis applies to cases under the EAJA). The Ninth Circuit has cautioned that 
<line: 16> district courts may not reduce requested fees in social security disability appeals without 
<line: 17> providing relatively specific reasons. Costa v. Comm’r Soc. Sec. Admin., 690 F.3d 1132, 1136–
<line: 18> 37 (9th Cir. 2012). 

[TITLE]
<line: 20> DISCUSSION 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> Plaintiff seeks attorney’s fees in the amount of $6,809.24. The Commissioner argues that 
<line: 23> the Court should decline to award fees because the government’s position was substantially 
<line: 24> justified. The Commissioner argues that the Court found that the ALJ adequately incorporated 
<line: 25> “all” of the limitations found by Dr. Ronald Sandoval, PhD and those limitations included 
<line: 26> Plaintiff’s ability to tolerate noise, and thus the ALJ’s incorporation of noise level three into the 
<line: 27> RFC was rational and substantially justified. The Commissioner misunderstands the Court’s 
<line: 28> findings with regards to Dr. Sandoval and the ALJ’s error with respect to noise level three. 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> In rejecting Plaintiff’s claim of error relating to Dr. Sandoval, the Court listed the specific 
<line: 3> limitations it found Dr. Sandoval had opined about, and found that those limitations were 
<line: 4> adequately incorporated into the RFC. Those limitations did not include any limitation relating to 
<line: 5> noise level.  

[TEXT]
<line: 7> In finding error relating to noise level three, the Court found that the ALJ had provided 
<line: 8> no explanation for the determination that Plaintiff was limited to noise level three instead of 
<line: 9> noise level two. The Court did not find that the ALJ’s conclusion was irrational or not supported 
<line: 10> by substantial evidence in the record, but instead found that the ALJ failed to explain how the 
<line: 11> medical evidence supported a noise level three limitation. The Court noted that “[a]n ALJ cannot 
<line: 12> summarize evidence and merely posit a conclusion.” Guembes v. Berryhill, 2017 WL 4330779, 
<line: 13> at *7 (D. Or. Sept. 29, 2017) (citing Garrison v. Colvin, 759 F.3d 995 (9th Cir. 2014)). Thus, the 
<line: 14> Court found that it could not conduct a meaningful review of the ALJ’s conclusion. 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> The Commissioner argues that Dr. Sandoval’s opinion supports the ALJ’s conclusion that 
<line: 17> noise level three was the appropriate limitation. But the ALJ did not describe how Dr. Sandoval’s 
<line: 18> opinion supports such a limitation. That was the problem with the ALJ’s analysis—not that 
<line: 19> Dr. Sandoval’s opinion or some other medical evidence did not support the limitation (although 
<line: 20> the Court renders no opinion on that issue one way or the other)—but that there was no 
<line: 21> explanation provided for the Court to meaningfully review.  

[TEXT]
<line: 23> Thus, for the Commissioner’s position to be substantially justified, the ALJ must have 
<line: 24> been substantially justified in offering no explanation for how the medical evidence supports a 
<line: 25> noise level three limitation. The Social Security regulations and case law have long required that 
<line: 26> an ALJ provide a narrative discussion describing how the evidence supports the conclusions in 
<line: 27> the RFC. Accordingly, the Commissioner’s position was not substantially justified. This is not a

[TEXT]
<line: 2> “a decidedly unusual case in which there is substantial justification under the EAJA even though 
<line: 3> the agency’s decision was reversed as lacking in reasonable, substantial and probative evidence 
<line: 4> in the record.” Thangaraja, 428 F.3d at 874. Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to EAJA fees. 

[TEXT]
<line: 6> The Commissioner does not challenge the reasonableness of Plaintiff’s fee request. The 
<line: 7> Court has considered the request and finds it to be reasonable.  

[TITLE]
<line: 9> CONCLUSION 

[TEXT]
<line: 11> Plaintiff’s application for attorney’s fees (ECF 16) is GRANTED. Plaintiff is 
<line: 12> awarded $6,809.24 for attorney’s fees under 28 U.S.C. § 2412. EAJA fees are subject to any 
<line: 13> offsets allowed under the Treasury Offset Program, as discussed in Ratliff, 560 U.S. at 593-94. 
<line: 14> Because Plaintiff has filed with the Court an assignment of EAJA fees to counsel, if Plaintiff has 
<line: 15> no debt subject to the Treasury Offset Program, then Defendant shall cause the check to be made 
<line: 16> payable to Plaintiff’s attorney and mailed to Plaintiff’s attorney at 1336 E. Burnside St., 
<line: 17> Suite 130, Portland, OR 97132. If Plaintiff owes a debt subject to the Treasury Offset Program, 
<line: 18> then the check for any remaining funds after offset of the debt shall be payable to Plaintiff and 
<line: 19> mailed to Plaintiff’s attorney.

<line: 21> IT IS SO ORDERED.
