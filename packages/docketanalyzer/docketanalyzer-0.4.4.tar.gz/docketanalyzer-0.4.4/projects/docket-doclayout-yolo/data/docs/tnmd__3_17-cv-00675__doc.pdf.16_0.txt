<line: 24> The initial case management conference in this case was set for October 30, 2017, at 
<line: 25> 11:00 a.m.  See Order at Docket No. 13.  No party appeared at that time on October 30, 2017.  The 
<line: 26> parties were also directed to file a proposed initial case management order prior to the initial case 
<line: 27> management conference.  No proposed initial case management order was filed.  The parties were 
<line: 28> previously notified that failure to file the proposed case management order could result in 
<line: 29> sanctions.  See Docket No. 6.1  Plaintiff’s failure to prosecute this case has caused considerable 

[ABANDON]
<line: 31> 1 The initial case management conference was originally scheduled for June 5, 2017 
<line: 32> (Docket No. 6).  However, because the record was not clear that Plaintiff had served several of the 
<line: 33> original Defendants, by order entered on June 2, 2017 (Docket No. 9), the initial case management 
<line: 34> conference was rescheduled to July 31, 2017, to allow for proof of service.  On the morning of 
<line: 35> July 31, 2017, the undersigned’s chambers were notified that Plaintiffs’ attorney would be unable 
<line: 36> to attend the initial case management conference due to illness.  Because it appeared that multiple 
<line: 37> Defendants still remained unserved, Plaintiff was notified that unless returns of service were filed 
<line: 38> by August 14, 2017, a recommendation would be made for dismissal as to any Defendants not 
<line: 39> served.  See Order at Docket No. 10.  The initial case management conference was continued to 
<line: 40> be reset by later order.  Id.  A report and recommendation issued on August 17, 2017 (Docket 
<line: 41> No. 11) recommending dismissal as to all Defendants other than Defendant Jean Perez.  An order 
<line: 42> was entered by Chief Judge Crenshaw on September 7, 2017 (Docket No. 12) adopting the report 
<line: 43> and recommendation. By subsequent order entered on September 15, 2017 (Docket No. 13), 
<line: 44> Defendant Perez was given additional time to answer the complaint, and the initial case 
<line: 45> management conference was reset for October 30, 2017.
