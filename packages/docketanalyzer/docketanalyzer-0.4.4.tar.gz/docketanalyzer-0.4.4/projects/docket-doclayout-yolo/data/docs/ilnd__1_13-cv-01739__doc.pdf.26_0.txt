[TEXT]
<line: 22> Plaintiff-appellant Lorrie A. Tiberio ("Tiberio") appeals from a May 27, 2011 judgment of the United States
<line: 23> District Court for the Western District of New York (Michael A. Telesca, Judge ), dismissing her disability
<line: 24> discrimination claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA'), 42 U.S.C. $$ 12101 et seq., as
<line: 25> untimely. Concluding that the 90--day limitations period provided by 42 U.S.C. $ 2000e-5(f)(1)1 begins to
<line: 26> run when a right-to-sue letter issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC" or
<line: 27> "Commission') is first received either by the claimant or by the claimant's counsel, we affirm the judgment
<line: 28> of the District Court..

[TEXT]
<line: 6> 4. Additionally, Plaintiff's Title Vll color and national origin claims must be.
<line: 7> dismissed because Plaintiff did not include those claims in the Charge of Discrimination he filed.
<line: 8> with the EEOC and thus failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. As a result. those claims
<line: 9> are barred and must be dismissed for failure to state a claim.

[TITLE]
<line: 11> ANSWER

[TEXT]
<line: 13> 4.) The Defendant's (Saint Gobain Containers) claim in #4 are baseless and without merit. The.
<line: 14> Defendant's Agent or Counsel lacks the depth of perception, that as a Moorish American all.
<line: 15> "marks" (or trademarks) have been placed on the Plaintiff and his entire ancestry..
<line: 16> As a Moorish American the Plaintiff is Sovereign in his National Origin, in addition the Plaintiff
<line: 17> (Michael Ruffin El), was marked as Black, Negro and/or Colored. The Plaintiff took exhaustive
<line: 18> measures to allow for negotiation with Defendant, therefore the "Right to Sue" notice from EEOC is.
<line: 19> the "prerequisite" before filing the private lawsuit in Federal Court..

[TEXT]
<line: 21> The Plaintiff affirms that as a Moorish American he uniquely suffers from all marks or "trademarks"
<line: 22> placed upon human property and/or slaves.
