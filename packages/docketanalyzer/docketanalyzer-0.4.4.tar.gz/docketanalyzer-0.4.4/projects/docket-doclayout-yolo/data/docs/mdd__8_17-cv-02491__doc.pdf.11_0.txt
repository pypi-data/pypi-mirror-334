<line: 18> Petition for Post-Conviction Relief 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Mr. Barber, then self-represented, had earlier filed a petition for post-conviction relief in 
<line: 21> the Circuit Court for Wicomico County, Maryland on July 27, 2012, which was later supplemented 
<line: 22> by his counsel on June 5, 2013, presenting the following claims of ineffective assistance of trial 
<line: 23> counsel:  

[TEXT]
<line: 25> I. 
<line: 26> Counsel was ineffective for failure to investigate the State’s medical expert 
<line: 27> testimony and violated Mr. Barber’s right to due process by failing to offer a viable 
<line: 28> defense.  

[TEXT]
<line: 30> A. 
<line: 31> Counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to investigate the 
<line: 32> State’s medical expert testimony that was central to the jury’s credibility 
<line: 33> assessment of the victim.[1] 
<line: 34> B. 
<line: 35> The admission of inaccurate and misleading scientific evidence 
<line: 36> violates the due process clause. 

[TEXT]
<line: 38> II. 
<line: 39> Counsel rendered ineffective assistance for failure to object to the victim’s 
<line: 40> inadmissible prior inconsistent statements; for failure to object when the State made 
<line: 41> rehabilitative remarks during their opening statement; and failure to request a 
<line: 42> limiting instruction.

<line: 8> B. 
<line: 9> Counsel rendered ineffective assistance for failure to object when

<line: 8> The Court of Special Appeals granted the application for leave to appeal on September 23, 
<line: 9> 2015, with respect to one question: 

[TEXT]
<line: 11> Did the post-conviction court err in concluding that defense counsel did not 
<line: 12> provide constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to investigate and 
<line: 13> present expert testimony to counter expert testimony presented by the State 
<line: 14> that the alleged “victim’s ‘normal’ examination was not inconsistent with 
<line: 15> possible sexual abuse?”

<line: 27> Mr. Barber filed this § 2254 petition on August 29, 2017, seeking relief on the ground of 
<line: 28> ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  He claims that trial counsel rendered constitutionally 
<line: 29> ineffective assistance in violation of the Sixth Amendment:  (1) by failing to investigate the State’s 
<line: 30> medical expert testimony and by failing to offer a viable defense; (2) by “the admission of

[TEXT]
<line: 7> Respondents argue that Mr. Barber’s first six claims withstand scrutiny under 28 U.S.C.

[TITLE]
<line: 10>        PROCEDURAL DEFAULT 

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Before seeking review pursuant to § 2254, a person in custody must exhaust remedies 
<line: 13> available in state court by presenting each claim to the appropriate state court.  A claim is 
<line: 14> procedurally defaulted when a petitioner has failed to present it to the highest state court with 
<line: 15> jurisdiction to hear it, and the state courts would now find that the petitioner cannot assert that 
<line: 16> claim.  Mickens v. Taylor, 240 F.3d 348, 356 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting Breard v. Pruett, 134 F.3d 
<line: 17> 615, 619 (4th Cir. 1998)).  Procedurally defaulted claims are not subject to substantive federal 
<line: 18> habeas corpus review unless certain exceptions apply to excuse the procedural default.   Procedural 
<line: 19> default may be excused if a petitioner can demonstrate (1) both cause for the procedural default 
<line: 20> and that he will suffer prejudice if the claims are not considered on their merits; or (2) failure to 
<line: 21> consider the defaulted claim(s) would result in a miscarriage of justice, i.e. the conviction of 
<line: 22> someone who is actually innocent of the offenses.  See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 495-96 
<line: 23> (1986); Gray, 806 F.3d at 709; Breard v. Pruett, 134 F.3d 615, 620 (4th Cir. 1998). 

[TEXT]
<line: 25> Respondents assert that Mr. Barber’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim for failing to 
<line: 26> show him the recording of the victim’s interview is procedurally defaulted.  ECF No. 4 p. 71.  Mr. 
<line: 27> Barber acknowledges in the petition that this claim was not presented to a state court.  ECF No. 1 
<line: 28> p.7.  As he offers no reason why the claim was not raised in state court, nor shows cause to excuse 
<line: 29> procedural default, this claim will be denied and dismissed as procedurally defaulted.

<line: 4>         STANDARD OF REVIEW 

[TEXT]
<line: 6> The court may grant a petition for a writ of habeas corpus only for violations of the 
<line: 7> Constitution or laws of the United States.  28 U.S.C. § 2254(a) (providing a district court “shall 
<line: 8> entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the 
<line: 9> judgment of a State court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution 
<line: 10> or laws or treaties of the United States”).  

[TEXT]
<line: 12> The federal habeas statute sets forth a highly deferential standard for evaluating state court 
<line: 13> rulings, under which state court decisions are to “be given the benefit of the doubt.”  Bell v. Cone, 
<line: 14> 543 U.S. 447, 455 (2005); Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 333 n.7 (1997).   

[TEXT]
<line: 16> A federal court reviewing a habeas petition that has already been adjudicated 
<line: 17> on the merits in state court [must] give considerable deference to the state court 
<line: 18> decision. A federal court may not grant habeas relief unless the state court 
<line: 19> arrived at a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable 
<line: 20> application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme 
<line: 21> Court of the United States, or a decision that was based on an unreasonable 
<line: 22> determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court 
<line: 23> proceeding.

<line: 25> Nicolas v. Att’y Gen. of Md., 820 F.3d 124, 129 (4th Cir. 2016) (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)).  A 
<line: 26> federal habeas court “must presume that the state court’s factual findings are correct unless the 
<line: 27> petitioner rebuts those facts by clear and convincing evidence,” and “cannot disturb the state 
<line: 28> court’s ruling simply because it is incorrect; it must also be unreasonable.” Id. 

[TEXT]
<line: 30> A state adjudication is “contrary to” clearly established federal law under § 2254(d)(1) 
<line: 31> where the state court “arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on 
<line: 32> a question of law” or “confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant Supreme 
<line: 33> Court precedent and arrives at a result opposite to [the Supreme Court].”  Williams v. Taylor, 529 
<line: 34> U.S. 362, 405 (2000) see Lovitt v. True, 403 F.3d 171, 178 (4th Cir. 2005); Barnes v. Joyner, 751

<line: 4> concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied established 
<line: 5> federal law erroneously or incorrectly.”  Lovitt, 403 F.3d at 178 (quoting Williams, 529 U.S. at 
<line: 6> 411).  The state court’s application of federal law must be unreasonable, not merely incorrect.  Id.; 
<line: 7> see Barnes, 751 F.3d at 238–39 (state court’s decision is an unreasonable application of clearly 
<line: 8> established federal law when the state court identifies the correct governing principle but 
<line: 9> unreasonably applies that principle to the facts; application of federal law must be objectively 
<line: 10> unreasonable, not merely incorrect). 

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Under section 2254(d)(2), “a state-court factual determination is not unreasonable merely 
<line: 13> because the federal habeas court would have reached a different conclusion in the first instance.”  
<line: 14> Wood v. Allen, 558 U.S. 290, 301 (2010).  “[E]ven if reasonable minds reviewing the record might 
<line: 15> disagree about the finding in question,” a federal court may not conclude that the state court 
<line: 16> decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.  Further, “a determination of a 
<line: 17> factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct[,]” and the petitioner bears “the 
<line: 18> burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.”  28 U.S.C. 
<line: 19> § 2254(e)(1).  “Where the state court conducted an evidentiary hearing and explained its reasoning 
<line: 20> with some care, it should be particularly difficult to establish clear and convincing evidence of 
<line: 21> error on the state court’s part.”  Sharpe v. Bell, 593 F.3d 372, 378 (4th Cir. 2010).  This is especially 
<line: 22> true where the state court has “resolved issues like witness credibility, which are ‘factual

<line: 5> Wehberg opined that a “normal” finding was not inconsistent with G.S.’s report that Mr. Barber 
<line: 6> had penetrated her vagina with his penis, explaining that the “vagina is very, vascular and very 
<line: 7> elastic, and can heal very rapidly.  Often within a few days, if you have genital trauma, it can be 
<line: 8> healed to the point where you can't recognize it as trauma.”  Id. pp. 120-121; ECF No. 4-13 p. 7.   
<line: 9> Thus, “[a] normal genital exam can be consistent with penetrating vaginal abuse.”  ECF 4-3 p.

<line: 12> On cross-examination, Dr. Wehberg was questioned further about the examination: 
<line: 13> Q.  You examined as part of her genital examination, the presence or absence 
<line: 14> of a hymen, correct? 

[TEXT]
<line: 16>       A.  Yes. 
<line: 17>       Q.  And you describe her hymen as crescentic? 
<line: 18>       A.  Crescentic. 
<line: 19>       Q.  Crescentic. Can you tell me what that means? 

[TEXT]
<line: 21> A.  A hymen is a thin membrane of tissue that covers the vaginal opening. 
<line: 22> When you’re very young, your hymen is what we call, annular. It’s circular in 
<line: 23> shape covering the vaginal opening. As you get more into young childhood, it 
<line: 24> becomes a crescent which is a half-moon shape.  It goes over the hymen, and 
<line: 25> you can see a crescent of a thin membrane. 

[TEXT]
<line: 27> Q.  Okay. 

[TEXT]
<line: 29> A. That hymen as you enter puberty again turns into an an[]ular hymen which 
<line: 30> is round. 

[TEXT]
<line: 32> Q.  The genital examination was perfectly normal, correct? 

[TEXT]
<line: 34> A.  Yes, it was.  
<line: 35> Q.  There was, according to the report, no scarring, no damage, is that a fair 
<line: 36> statement? 

[TEXT]

[TEXT]
<line: 4> The only crime of which [Mr. Barber] was convicted that required proof of 
<line: 5> penetration was second-degree rape.  The flagship allegation made in [Mr. 
<line: 6> Barber’s] petition for post-conviction relief dealt with two criticisms:  (1) that 
<line: 7> defense never consulted with an OBGYN or a child sexual abuse specialist; and 
<line: 8> (2) no defense expert was called to refute the opinion of Dr. Wehberg that a 
<line: 9> normal genital exam can be consistent with penetrating sexual abuse. 

[TEXT]
<line: 11> ECF No. 4-13 p. 9.  The court explained that penetration is a necessary element of the crime of 
<line: 12> second-degree rape under Maryland law, citing Kackley v. State, 63 Md. App. 532 (1985) (citations 
<line: 13> omitted).  “Penetration, however slight, will sustain a conviction . . . but the proof thereof must 
<line: 14> sustain a res in re, that is, an actual entrance of the sexual organ of the male within the labia 
<line: 15> (majora) of the pudendum (the external folds of the vulva) of the female organ, and nothing less 
<line: 16> will suffice.”  Craig v. State, 214 Md. 546, 136 A.2d 243 (1957) citing 1 Wharton, Criminal Law 
<line: 17> (l2th ed.), § 697.  “Penetration into either the labia minoria or the vagina is not required; invasion 
<line: 18> of the labia majora, however slight is sufficient to establish penetration.”  Craig, 214 Md at 546.  
<line: 19> ECF No. 4-13 pp.  9-10.3  The Court of Special Appeals then examined the testimony presented at 
<line: 20> trial.

<line: 23> Testimony of Theodore Hariton, M.D. 
<line: 24> Dr. Theodore Hariton, a board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist from Arizona called 
<line: 25> by Mr. Barber as a witness, testified that he had reviewed Dr. Wehberg’s trial testimony, Heather 
<line: 26> Sullivan’s deposition and trial testimony, and G.S.’s trial testimony.  On direct examination, Dr, 
<line: 27> Hariton testified: 

[TEXT]
<line: 29> Q. And after you reviewed it did you arrive at any conclusions regarding 
<line: 30> whether the medical evidence was consistent with penetration?     

[TEXT]
<line: 32> A.  I did.  

[ABANDON]
<line: 34> 3 
<line: 35> On the issue of penetration, the jury at Mr. Barber’s trial was instructed, that “[v]aginal 
<line: 36> intercourse means the penetration of a penis into the vagina.  The slightest penetration is sufficient, 
<line: 37> and the emission of semen is not required.”  ECF No. 4-3 p. 13.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> Q.  And what were those conclusions? 

[TEXT]
<line: 6> A. With reasonable medical certainty there’s no medical evidence that penal 
<line: 7> [sic] vaginal penetration occurred at that time. 

[TEXT]
<line: 9> Q. Okay. So it would be unusual for a six-year old or a very young girl to 
<line: 10> have no finding after an episode of nonconsensual penal [sic] vaginal 
<line: 11> penetration? 

[TEXT]
<line: 13> A. Yes, it would. 
<line: 14> Q. And what would you expect the history and physical findings to be that 
<line: 15> would be consistent with vaginal penetration? 

[TEXT]
<line: 17> A. Well, two things.  First of all, the history, you should have pain and 
<line: 18> bleeding.  If you go inside a hymen and tear a hymen in a little girl it will 
<line: 19> bleed and cause pain.  The second thing is it will heal, all of them heal very 
<line: 20> nicely but it will heal with some physical change in shape that will tell you 
<line: 21> something happened in this period of time.  

[TEXT]
<line: 23> Q.  And are both these findings important? 

[TEXT]
<line: 25> A. Yes. 

[TEXT]
<line: 27> Q. And why so? 

[TEXT]
<line: 29> A Well, the history of bleeding, pain, and bleeding is one of the most 
<line: 30> consistent things in all the literature. 

[TEXT]
<line: 32> Q. Okay. 

[TEXT]
<line: 34> A. When you go through the findings you have the history of pain and 
<line: 35> bleeding. 

[TEXT]
<line: 37> Q.  And were these present in this case? 

[TEXT]
<line: 39> A.  No, there was no evidence-I’m sorry, there was nothing in this record 
<line: 40> that I found. 

[TEXT]
<line: 42> Q. What would be the diameter of a vaginal opening in a girl this age? 

[TEXT]
<line: 44> A.  Hymenal opening in a girl in this age would be six or seven millimeters, 
<line: 45> like half the size of your little finger.

<line: 4> A.  35  to 39 millimeters. 

[TEXT]
<line: 6> Q.  It’s about an inch and a half? 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> A.  About an inch and a half, yeah. 
<line: 9> Q.  Okay, so it’s maybe an inch and a half trying to get into a quarter inch 
<line: 10> roughly? 

[TEXT]
<line: 12> A.  Roughly. 
<line: 13> Q.  Now is the hymen stretchable or would it tear if it were penetrated? 

[TEXT]
<line: 15> A.  It is not stretchable.  When you examine a little girl, frequently you’ll 
<line: 16> have to examine and get a specimen with a Q-tip.  And if you touch the 
<line: 17> hymen with your Q-tip, the kid jumps.  It is very delicate and very thin. 

[TEXT]
<line: 19>     ********** 

[TEXT]
<line: 21> Q. Okay.  Now what would a normal six-year old vaginal area look like? 

[TEXT]
<line: 23> A.  Well, the labia majora would be flat, the labia minora is very thin.  The 
<line: 24> whole area is pinkish.  It’s a little redder than an adult because the tissue, 
<line: 25> the vessels are so close to the skin.  It’s very thin, two to three cells thick, 
<line: 26> it’s not stretchable, it’s very easy, it not distensible because there is no 
<line: 27> rigi[dity][4], it won’t stretch.  It’s really vulnerable to any trauma or 
<line: 28> infection.

<line: 30>      ********** 

[TEXT]
<line: 32> Q. So what kind of medical evidence could be found after forceful penal 
<line: 33> [sic] vaginal penetration of a girl around six years old? 

[TEXT]
<line: 35> A.  What you should see is depending if it’s a complete laceration or not- 
<line: 36> Q.  Could you speak a little bit slower? 

[TEXT]
<line: 38> A.  Okay, I’m sorry. It depends on the depth of the penetration, how far it 
<line: 39> went.  It doesn’t fit so therefore it can’t go very far.  But it can tear.  If it’s 
<line: 40> a transection, which means it goes all the way through the hymen down to 
<line: 41> the vagina, then you’ll see that the hymen is a circle like this, and would be 
<line: 42> a totally completed circle.  If you tear, do a transection, it means you cut all 
<line: 43> the way through here, this would be the vagina, and when they heal it will 
<line: 44> still heal like this but it will heal with a section, there won’t be any hymen 
<line: 45> here at all.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> First and most important, she said that the hymen of a little girl is very 
<line: 21> vascular and elastic.  It is not elastic, it’s not stretchable at all, and it’s not 
<line: 22> vascular.  It looks a little pinker than the rest of the tissue because it’s so 
<line: 23> thin blood, the vessels that are there are closer to the surface.  But it’s not 
<line: 24> stretchable.

<line: 30> findings” and cited to several publications in support of his position.  ECF No. 4-6 p. 27-31; ECF 
<line: 31> No. 4-13 p. 14.  Asked whether he was “comfortable in saying there’s no medical evidence of

<line: 4> On cross examination, Dr. Hariton testified that there should be scarring if there is injury 
<line: 5> to the hymen in a prepubertal girl.  The amount of scarring will be different depending on the age,

[TEXT]
<line: 8> A.  So if there is superficial injury to the hymen will a physician be able to

<line: 10> Q.  It may or may not form a notch, a superficial notch.  But a penis can’t 
<line: 11> get in a little -- a 39 millimeter penis can't get into a six millimeter hymen 
<line: 12> with a superficial injury.

[TEXT]
<line: 18> A.  So while I appreciate your definition that it’s you know, penile

[TEXT]
<line: 22> A  That’s but to a juror I think penetration means penetration.  The word

<line: 37> A. What we termed chronic conditions in the previous edition was better 
<line: 38> described as medical findings associated with healed genital trauma.  Since 
<line: 39> most children delay disclosure, medical professionals are typically asked to 
<line: 40> evaluate a child long after injuries should have healed.  However, as noted 
<line: 41> previously, where there has been significant trauma associated with vaginal

<line: 4> III. 
<line: 5> Analysis 

[TEXT]
<line: 7> The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution affords a criminal defendant the 
<line: 8> right to “Assistance of Counsel.”  U.S. Const. amend. VI.  The Supreme Court has stated that 
<line: 9> “assistance which is ineffective in preserving fairness [of a trial] does not meet the constitutional 
<line: 10> mandate.”  Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 166 (2002).  In Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 
<line: 11> 668 (1984), the Court explained that to show constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel, a 
<line: 12> petitioner must show both deficient performance and prejudice—that “counsel made errors so 
<line: 13> serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth 
<line: 14> Amendment,” id. at 687, and that “there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s 
<line: 15> unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.”  Id. at 694. 

[TEXT]
<line: 17> To satisfy the deficient performance prong of the Strickland standard, a defendant must 
<line: 18> show “that counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.” 
<line: 19> Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U.S. 365, 375 (1986).  “Judicial scrutiny of counsel’s performance 
<line: 20> must be highly deferential” and not based on hindsight.  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.  “[A] court 
<line: 21> must indulge a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable 
<line: 22> professional assistance.”  Id.  A petitioner “... must overcome the presumption that, under the 
<line: 23> circumstances, the challenged action ‘might be considered sound trial strategy.’”  Id.  Decisions 
<line: 24> made by counsel may be subject to second-guessing with the benefit of hindsight; however, 
<line: 25> counsel’s tactical and strategic choices made after due consideration do not constitute ineffective 
<line: 26> assistance of counsel, and there is a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct was within the wide 
<line: 27> range of reasonable professional assistance.  Id.

<line: 4> Under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant “has a right to effective representation, not a 
<line: 5> right to an attorney who performs his duties ‘mistake-free.’”  Weaver v. Massachusetts, 137 S. Ct.

[TEXT]
<line: 8> To satisfy the prejudice prong of the Strickland standard, a petitioner must show “that there 
<line: 9> exists a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the 
<line: 10> proceeding would have been different.”  Kimmelman, 477 U.S. at 375.  “The essence of an 
<line: 11> ineffective-assistance claim is that counsel’s unprofessional errors so upset the adversarial balance 
<line: 12> between defense and prosecution that the trial was rendered unfair and the verdict rendered 
<line: 13> suspect.”  Kimmelman, 477 U.S. at 374.  A determination whether the attorney’s performance was 
<line: 14> deficient need not be made if it is clear that there was no prejudice.  See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 
<line: 15> 697.

<line: 17> “The standards created by Strickland and § 2254(d) are both highly deferential, and when

<line: 19> (internal citations omitted).  “When § 2254(d) applies, the question is not whether counsel’s

<line: 26> On post-conviction review Mr. Barber argued that expert testimony countering Dr. 
<line: 27> Wehberg's opinion would have helped to present a valid defense to the rape charge, and also bolster 
<line: 28> counsel’s attack on G.S.’s credibility as to whether any abuse occurred at all.  He argued that his 
<line: 29> trial counsel was deficient because, had he consulted with a medical expert, he would have found 
<line: 30> a basis to challenge Dr. Wehberg’s testimony as inconsistent with G.S.’s allegations.  Specifically,

<line: 5> that penile vaginal penetration in a prepubertal girl can occur without any physical findings.  Mr. 
<line: 6> Barber further argued that counsel’s strategy was unreasonable because further investigation and 
<line: 7> efforts to counter Dr. Wehberg’s conclusions would not have detracted from the stated trial 
<line: 8> strategy.  ECF No. 4-13 p. 27.  

[TEXT]
<line: 10> The State countered that trial counsel’s strategy not to consult an expert was part of a 
<line: 11> legitimate trial strategy, and Mr. Barber failed to prove the strategy was uninformed or 
<line: 12> unreasonable. No. 4-13 pp. 26-27.  

[TEXT]
<line: 14> Applying the Strickland standard, the Court of Special Appeals examined trial counsel’s 
<line: 15> performance, taking note of his experience defending sexual abuse cases, his review of Dr. 
<line: 16> Wehberg’s report, and his decision to defend Mr. Barber by impeaching G.S. to demonstrate her 
<line: 17> lack of credibility to convince the jury the State had failed to prove Mr. Barber’s guilt beyond a 
<line: 18> reasonable doubt.  The Court of Special Appeals rejected Mr. Barber’s contention that had trial 
<line: 19> counsel consulted a medical expert like Dr. Hariton, or relevant medical literature, trial counsel 
<line: 20> could have found information that a prepubertal girl could not have a normal genital exam after 
<line: 21> penetration, stating that “[c]ontrary to Dr. Hariton’s testimony, there was ample medical literature 
<line: 22> from very reputable peer reviewed medical journals that supported Dr. Wehberg’s opinion.”  ECF 
<line: 23> 4-13 pp. 35-36 (citations to medical journals omitted).  The court stated: 

[TEXT]
<line: 25> A competent criminal defense lawyer representing a defendant in a case like this 
<line: 26> one, should, upon receipt of a report by a medical expert like Dr. Wehberg, consult 
<line: 27> an independent expert under some, but not all, circumstances.  One of the 
<line: 28> circumstances where an expert should be consulted would be if the lawyer is 
<line: 29> unfamiliar with the medical literature concerning the issue about which the State’s 
<line: 30> expert is prepared to testify.  In this case, trial counsel testified that he was presently 
<line: 31> familiar with the relevant medical literature.  But trial counsel was never asked 
<line: 32> about what he did know.  Except for trial counsel’s testimony, there was no other

<line: 8> ECF No. 4-13 pp. 37-38.  Turning to the related issue of what trial counsel should have known in 

[TEXT]
<line: 10> 2010, had he consulted the relevant literature, the court stated: 

[TEXT]
<line: 12> There is nothing in the record to show that what Dr. Wehberg said about the vaginal 
<line: 13> area was in error.  So no matter how much research [Mr. Barber’s] trial counsel had 
<line: 14> done, the State’s expert could not have been effectively cross-examined on that 
<line: 15> point.  Appellant takes a contrary view, which is based on Dr. Hariton’s testimony. 
<line: 16> Dr. Hariton said that Dr. Wehberg was wrong when she said that “the hymen of a 
<line: 17> little girl is very vascular and elastic.”  But, contrary to what Dr. Hariton testified 
<line: 18> to, Dr. Wehberg never testified that the hymen is “very vascular” and “elastic.”  She 
<line: 19> testified that the “vaginal area is very vascular and very elastic and can heal very 
<line: 20> rapidly.”  As the State points out, appellant’s argument is like comparing apples to 
<line: 21> oranges.

<line: 23> Id. pp. 38-39.   

[TEXT]
<line: 25> In regard to Mr. Barber’s contention that trial counsel should have consulted with and 
<line: 26> called a witness who would have testified as Dr. Hariton did at the post-conviction hearing, the 
<line: 27> court concluded: 

[TEXT]
<line: 29> In our view, G.S.’s testimony did not make it clear that there was “forceful 
<line: 30> penetration” through the hymen.  See Adams, supra, at 32L (“Young children have 
<line: 31> no concept of what is meant by the term in the vagina.  A statement such as ‘he put 
<line: 32> his thing in my privates may or may not mean that full penetration occurred.’”).  If 
<line: 33> there had been forceful penetration into the vagina, as both Dr. Hariton and Dr. 
<line: 34> Wehberg agree, there would have been bleeding - and G.S. did not report bleeding. 
<line: 35> As already pointed out, to prove second-degree rape in Maryland, proof of 
<line: 36> penetration through the hymen is not necessary.  And, even Dr. Hariton does not 
<line: 37> contend that two years after the event that there would be signs of trauma, if the 
<line: 38> hymen is not ruptured.  Under such circumstances, it is far from clear what would 
<line: 39> have been gained if [Mr. Barber’s] counsel had found a doctor who would have 
<line: 40> contradicted Dr. Wehberg and said that if there is penetration of the hymen there 
<line: 41> will be evidence of that penetration in a post-rape examination.

<line: 4> lack of physical evidence to support the victim’s allegations; and (3) an articulate criminal 
<line: 5> defendant who can testify.  His strategy was to focus on G.S.’s lack of candor.  The court 
<line: 6> determined that trial counsel set forth a reasonable basis for his trial strategy.   

[TEXT]
<line: 8> It would not, of course, be considered sound trial strategy to not consult with a 
<line: 9> physician if something said in Dr. Wehberg’s report was manifestly in error or 
<line: 10> that she held an opinion that a reasonably competent lawyer, familiar with the 
<line: 11> relevant literature, should have recognized as invalid.  As shown, it is far from 
<line: 12> clear that any opinion Dr. Wehberg gave was in error.  At the time of trial (and 
<line: 13> presently) some, but not all, experts in her field agreed with Dr. Wehberg that 
<line: 14> a normal physical exam does not exclude the possibility of past penile 
<line: 15> penetration of the hymen.  Because of a significant number of journal articles 
<line: 16> supporting Dr. Wehberg’s views, calling an OBGYN who shared Dr. Hariton’s 
<line: 17> opinions would be risky inasmuch as such opinion could be contradicted, or at 
<line: 18> least undermined by the literature discussed, supra. 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Id. p. 41. 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> Applying the Strickland standard, the court observed that when counsel’s decision is based 
<line: 23> upon partial investigation, the resulting tactical decision remains presumptively reasonable 
<line: 24> “precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on 
<line: 25> investigation.”  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691.  In other words, representation is not ineffective if 
<line: 26> based on a reasonable investigation or “a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations 
<line: 27> unnecessary.”  Id.  Even a decision not to investigate is entitled to “a heavy measure of deference 
<line: 28> to counsel’s judgment.”  Id.  By focusing his efforts on establishing reasonable doubt, trial counsel 
<line: 29> did not provide ineffective assistance, even if the trial strategy did not result in a successful 
<line: 30> outcome for his client.  Thus, the court concluded Mr. Barber had failed to demonstrate that 
<line: 31> counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness to meet the 
<line: 32> performance prong of the Strickland test.  Having concluded that Mr. Barber failed to meet the 
<line: 33> performance prong of the Strickland standard, the Court of Special Appeals determined it 
<line: 34> unnecessary to consider the prejudice prong.  ECF No. 4-13 pp. 40-43.

<line: 18> of inaccurate and misleading scientific evidence that violated his right to due process.  Mr. Barber 
<line: 19> claimed that Dr. Wehberg’s testimony was misleading “because it was based on her 
<line: 20> misunderstanding of the generally accepted methodology for diagnosis of anatomical findings in 
<line: 21> relation to prior sexual acts,” and its admission violated his right to due process.  ECF No. 4-5 p.

<line: 24> In rejecting this claim, the post-conviction court determined that this evidence was not 
<line: 25> inaccurate or misleading, and found the case law on which Mr. Barber premised his due process

<line: 4> testimony at the Post-Conviction hearing, at most, merely cast doubt on Dr.

<line: 7> could rely on Dr. Wehberg’s inconclusive finding regarding abuse to argue that

<line: 24> Mr. Barber’s third claim for federal habeas relief is that trial counsel was ineffective for 
<line: 25> failing to request a limiting instruction that prior inconsistent statements offered by Dr. Wehberg, 
<line: 26> Ms. Sullivan, the social worker, and Tahesha Barber, the victim’s mother, were not intended for 
<line: 27> the truth that the abuse actually occurred.  Additionally, he faults trial counsel for failing to object 
<line: 28> to G.S.’s testimony that she told her mother and sister about the abuse.  The Circuit Court denied 
<line: 29> this claim for lack of merit because G.S’s statements to Dr. Wehberg and Ms. Sullivan were 
<line: 30> admissible for the truth of the matter asserted under Md. Code Ann., Crim. Pro.  § 11-304.  The

<line: 10> Turning to trial counsel’s decision not to object to Tahesha Barber’s testimony about G.S.’s 
<line: 11> statements, the post-conviction court found counsel’s action consistent with his stated trial 
<line: 12> strategy.  “ …[G.S.’s] allegations were largely unsubstantiated and there was no physical evidence 
<line: 13> to corroborate her story.  Ms. Barber’s testimony as well as [G.S.’s] testimony left Mr. McFadden 
<line: 14> ample room to argue reasonable doubt,” therefore, the court concluded that trial counsel’s 
<line: 15> “decision whether or not to object … was within, his sound discretion.”  ECF No. 4-7 p. 12.  The 
<line: 16> post-conviction court’s conclusion that the failure to object to statements made to Ms. Barber was 
<line: 17> part of a reasonable trial strategy given the circumstances and substance of those statements is 
<line: 18> entitled to deference under § 2254(f) and Strickland.  Accordingly, federal habeas relief is denied 
<line: 19> as to this claim.

<line: 22> Failing to Object to Witness Comments Claim 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Mr. Barber’s fourth claim is that trial counsel was constitutionally deficient for failing to 
<line: 25> object to comments made during the State’s opening statement and to request a limiting instruction.  

[TEXT]
<line: 27> The State’s opening statement began:

<line: 30> able to tell Child Protective Service worker Heather Sullivan that her stepfather, the 
<line: 31> defendant seated before you today, began to abuse her at age 5 and it continued for 
<line: 32> years.

<line: 32> ECF No. 4-5 p. 29.  The Circuit Court in its Statement of Reasons found no merit to Mr. Barber’s 
<line: 33> claims regarding the State’s opening statement.   

[TEXT]
<line: 35> The Petitioner alleges that the Assistant State’s Attorney, in her opening 
<line: 36> statement, “. . . effectively - and prejudicially - set the stage to rehabilitate [the 
<line: 37> victim’s] vague allegations.”  Petition, 21.  The Petitioner cites Maryland Rule 5- 
<line: 38> 616(c)(2), which indicates that there are three prerequisites to the admission of a 
<line: 39> prior statement as rehabilitation:  (1) the witness’ credibility must have been 
<line: 40> attacked; (2) the prior statement is consistent with the trial testimony; and (3) the 
<line: 41> prior statement detracts from the impeachment.  According to the Petitioner, these 
<line: 42> prerequisites were not satisfied.  After careful review of the transcript and 
<line: 43> consideration of the arguments, the Court finds that the State’s remarks in opening

<line: 4> statement were not improper, and thus Mr. McFadden’s failure to object is not 
<line: 5> ineffective assistance of counsel. 

[TEXT]
<line: 7> At the outset, the Court notes that the Petitioner has mischaracterized the 
<line: 8> prosecutor’s statements as rehabilitative.  The challenged remarks were that “she 
<line: 9> [the victim] didn’t tell [Sullivan and Wehberg] everything” and “I make no 
<line: 10> promises as to exactly what she [the victim] will be able to tell you today.”  In 
<line: 11> making these remarks, the Assistant State’s Attorney merely outlined what she 
<line: 12> expected the jury to hear that day, which embodies the very purpose of opening 
<line: 13> statements.  See White v. State, 11 Md. App. 423, 274 A.2d 671 (1971) (noting that 
<line: 14> opening statements are to advise the jury as to what it may expect by way of 
<line: 15> evidence and questions which will be presented to it). 

[TITLE]
<line: 17> ECF No. 4-7 p. 13. 

[TEXT]
<line: 19> The court also rejected Mr. Barber’s claim that trial counsel was deficient for failing to 
<line: 20> challenge the admissibility of prior out of court statements, for reasons already discussed in regard 
<line: 21> to Md. Code Ann., Crim. Pro. § 11-304. supra.  Lastly, the court found Mr. Barber’s claim that 
<line: 22> trial counsel was ineffective by failing to object and preserve the issue for appeal had no merit.  
<line: 23> Because the evidence and testimony were admissible, counsel was not ineffective for failing to 
<line: 24> object where there was no legal basis to a grant relief.  ECF No. 4-7 p. 13. 

[TEXT]
<line: 26> As already discussed, trial counsel does not provide ineffective assistance by failing to 
<line: 27> object to admissible evidence and testimony.  The state court ruling was neither contrary to, nor 
<line: 28> involved an unreasonable application of applicable Supreme Court precedent, nor was it based on 
<line: 29> an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court 
<line: 30> proceeding.  The state court decision is based on facts well-supported in the record and premised 
<line: 31> on a reasonable application of Strickland to those facts.

<line: 4> questioned at trial regarding what she said when G.S. told her of the sexual abuse, Ms. Barber 
<line: 5> answered: 

[TEXT]
<line: 7> Word for word, I don’t remember exactly what I told [G.S.].  I know that I was 
<line: 8> confident to [G.S.] when she told me.  I had gotten a little bit confused when 
<line: 9> you said May as to which time it was that she had said it.  She disclosed 
<line: 10> information to me twice.  May was the first time that she told me.  And the first 
<line: 11> time that she told me, I was just, you know, I was confused, you know.  She 
<line: 12> had just told me that, you know, my husband had touched her, and I didn’t want 
<line: 13> to believe it the first time she told me, you know.  But at the same time that’s 
<line: 14> my child so I was confident to [G.S.] and confused at the same time which was 
<line: 15> the reason why I reported it to the child advocacy center because I didn’t know 
<line: 16> what to do. 

[TEXT]
<line: 18> ECF No. 4-2 p. 171; ECF No. 4-7 p. 14. 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> The court found that Ms. Barber’s statements did not “constitute clear vouching” for G.S.’s 
<line: 21> truthfulness.  ECF No 4-7 p. 15.  Although the “plain meaning” of the comment that Ms. Barber 
<line: 22> “was confident to [G.S.] is not completely discernible,” the court continued that “if a reasonable 
<line: 23> inference can be drawn that Ms. Barber was commenting on [G.S.’s] truthfulness,” trial counsel’s 
<line: 24> failure to object was not ineffective assistance.  The court concluded that an objection would not 
<line: 25> likely have affected the outcome of trial.”  Id.  

[TEXT]
<line: 27> Mr. Barber next claimed that the prosecutor erred during closing argument by 
<line: 28> reemphasizing the victim’s credibility when she said: “Mother never doubted [the victim’s] 
<line: 29> credibility.  She didn’t want to believe her, but she never doubted that [the victim] was telling the 
<line: 30> truth.  Tr. 9/2/10, 35.”  Id.  The court found no error in admitting these statements as prosecutors 
<line: 31> are generally granted “liberal freedom of speech and may make any comment that is warranted by 
<line: 32> the evidence or inferences reasonably drawn therefrom.”  Spain v. State, 386 Md. 145, 152-3 
<line: 33> (2005) (quoting Degren v. State, 352 Md. 400, 429-30 (1999)).  Further, “[a]lthough courts have 
<line: 34> disapproved of the prosecutor ‘vouching’ for the credibility of a witness, courts have emphasized” 
<line: 35> that evaluating witness credibility “is often a transcendent factor in the factfinder’s decision

<line: 4> whether to convict or acquit a defendant” and counsel is permitted to “comment on or attack 
<line: 5> witness credibility by examining motive not to tell the truth.”  Id. at 154.  The Circuit Court found 
<line: 6> the prosecutor was not vouching for witness credibility, but merely commenting on the fact that 
<line: 7> G.S.’s mother believed her daughter.  The mother’s testimony was in evidence, and therefore, 
<line: 8> properly the subject of closing argument for both the State and the defense.  For these reasons, the 
<line: 9> court determined there was no error in admitting Ms. Barber’s statements or in the prosecution’s 
<line: 10> reference to them in closing argument, and trial counsel did not provide ineffective assistance by 
<line: 11> failing to raise an objection.  ECF No. 4-7 pp. 15-16. 

[TEXT]
<line: 13> As discussed supra, trial counsel’s failure to raise an objection that is without merit does 
<line: 14> not constitute deficient performance.  The post-conviction court’s decision is not “contrary to, or 
<line: 15> involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the 
<line: 16> Supreme Court of the United States,” nor is it “a decision that was based on an unreasonable 
<line: 17> determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”  28 
<line: 18> U.S.C. § 2254(d).  This claim provides no cause to award federal habeas relief and will be denied.  

[TITLE]
<line: 20> F. 
<line: 21> Failure to Object to Expert Testimony about Delayed Reporting Claim 

[TEXT]
<line: 23> Mr. Barber’s sixth claim is that trial counsel was deficient for failing to object to testimony 
<line: 24> by social worker Catherine Beers about delayed disclosure of sexual abuse.  Mr. Barber posits that 
<line: 25> counsel should have objected to Ms. Beers’ explanations concerning why G.S. delayed reporting 
<line: 26> sexual abuse, child abuse accommodation syndrome, and her conclusive statement supporting 
<line: 27> G.S.’s credibility. ECF No. 1 p. 6; ECF No. 4-5 pp. 16-17.  

[TEXT]
<line: 29> Mr. Barber argued in his post-conviction petition that Ms. Beers had not met anyone in the 
<line: 30> family and had not read any reports about the case.  Her testimony was based on her expertise in 
<line: 31> the subject matter and sitting through the trial, and was accepted without objection by trial counsel

<line: 4> even though G.S. “had already given a common sense reason that she did not disclose the alleged 
<line: 5> abuse earlier; “I was scared.”  ECF No. 4-5 pp. 16-17. 

[TEXT]
<line: 7> The Circuit Court concluded trial counsel’s determination not to object to Ms. Beers’ 
<line: 8> testimony did not constitute ineffective assistance.  Ms. Beers was accepted by the court as an 
<line: 9> expert in clinical social work and child abuse (ECF No. 4-2, pp. 186-189), and her statements were 
<line: 10> admissible as expert testimony under Md. Rule 5-702, which permits admission of expert 
<line: 11> testimony in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the testimony will assist the trier of fact to 
<line: 12> understand evidence or a fact at issue.  The Circuit Court further noted that a trial counsel’s failure 
<line: 13> to object “generally indicates that defense counsel felt that the trial error was not critical to his 
<line: 14> client’s case; presumably, therefore, the error did not render the trial fundamentally unfair.”  Engle 
<line: 15> v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 137 (1982), “The decision to interpose objections during trial is one of 
<line: 16> tactics and trial strategy.”  Oken v State, 343 Md. 256, 295 (1996).  “The Court cannot find that 
<line: 17> [trial counsel’s] decision not to object to Ms. Beers’ testimony rises to the level of ineffective 
<line: 18> assistance of counsel.”  ECF No. 4-7 pp. 16-17.    

[TEXT]
<line: 20> This court may not grant habeas relief unless it finds that the state court decision “was 
<line: 21> contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law” or 
<line: 22> “resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the 
<line: 23> evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”  28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).  Under these 
<line: 24> circumstances, the court finds no error in the state post-conviction court’s determination.  The state 
<line: 25> post-conviction court’s determination is well supported by the record.  The state post-conviction 
<line: 26> court’s findings are presumptively correct and withstand scrutiny pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) 
<line: 27> and (e).

[TITLE]
<line: 4>          CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY 

[TEXT]
<line: 6> Rule 11(a) of the Rules Governing § 2254 Cases states that the district court “must issue 
<line: 7> or deny a certificate of appealability when it enters a final order adverse to the applicant” in such 
<line: 8> cases.  28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).  To obtain a certificate of appealability, a habeas petitioner must 
<line: 9> make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.  Buck v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. 759, 
<line: 10> 773 (2017); Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 483–84 (2000).  When a district court rejects 
<line: 11> constitutional claims on the merits, a petitioner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that “jurists 
<line: 12> of reason could disagree with the district court’s resolution of his constitutional claims or that 
<line: 13> jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed 
<line: 14> further.”  Buck, 137 S. Ct. at 773.  When a petition is denied on procedural grounds, the petitioner 
<line: 15> meets this standard by showing that reasonable jurists “would find it debatable whether the petition 
<line: 16> states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right” and “whether the district court was 
<line: 17> correct in its procedural ruling.”  Slack, 529 U.S. at 484.   

[TEXT]
<line: 19> Mr. Barber’s claims are denied and dismissed on both procedural grounds and upon the 
<line: 20> merits.  Upon review of the record, he has not made the requisite showing to warrant a certificate 
<line: 21> of appealability as to any of his claims, and the court declines to issue one.  He may request that 
<line: 22> the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issue such a certificate.  See Lyons v. 
<line: 23> Lee, 316 F.3d 528, 532 (4th Cir. 2003). 

[TITLE]
<line: 25> CONCLUSION  

[TEXT]
<line: 27> For these reasons, the court will, by separate order, deny and dismiss the petition and 
<line: 28> decline to issue a Certificate of Appealability.
