<line: 24> This matter comes before the Court on Plaintiff Andrew Weist’s (“Plaintiff”) appeal of the 
<line: 25> final administrative decision of the Commissioner of Social Security (“Commissioner”), with 
<line: 26> respect to Administrative Law Judge Donna A. Krappa’s (“ALJ Krappa”, “the ALJ”) denial of 
<line: 27> Plaintiff’s claim for Disability Insurance Benefits (“DIB”) under the Social Security Act (“the 
<line: 28> Act”).  This appeal is decided without oral argument pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
<line: 29> 78.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 405(g).  Venue is proper 
<line: 30> under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).  For the reasons set forth below, this Court finds that ALJ Krappa’s 
<line: 31> factual findings are supported by substantial credible evidence and that her legal determinations 
<line: 32> are correct.  Therefore, the Commissioner’s decision is AFFIRMED.

<line: 3> PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL HISTORY 

[TITLE]
<line: 5> A. Procedural History 

[TEXT]
<line: 7> On July 9, 2012,1 Plaintiff filed a Title II application for DIB, alleging disability beginning 
<line: 8> January 25, 2012, based on depression, headaches, neck pain, and dizziness.  (Tr. 170, 186.)  
<line: 9> Plaintiff’s application was denied initially on December 28, 2012, and upon reconsideration on 
<line: 10> August 1, 2013.  (Tr. 1, 120.)  Plaintiff’s subsequent request for a hearing before an administrative 
<line: 11> law judge was granted and ALJ Krappa held a hearing on January 8, 2015.  (Tr. 27, 126.)  On 
<line: 12> March 13, 2015, ALJ Krappa issued a decision finding Plaintiff to be not disabled under sections 
<line: 13> 216(i) and 223(d) of the Act, thereby denying his DIB claim.  (Tr. 9-22.)  On July 5, 2016, the 
<line: 14> Appeals Council denied Plaintiff’s request for review of ALJ Krappa’s decision, making the ALJ’s 
<line: 15> decision the final decision of the Commissioner.  (Tr. 1-3.)  On September 7, 2016, Plaintiff filed 
<line: 16> an appeal with this Court, requesting that the Commissioner’s decision be reversed and that 
<line: 17> Plaintiff be awarded Title II benefits under the Act.  (See Compl. 2-3).

[TITLE]
<line: 21> 1. Personal and Employment History 

[TEXT]
<line: 23> Plaintiff was born January 14, 1970.  (Tr. 170.)  He has an 11th grade education and worked 
<line: 24> as a cemetery carpenter, cemetery maintenance worker, and an automobile body repair helper from 
<line: 25> 1995 to 2012.  (Tr. 187.)  He was 42 years old when he allegedly became disabled on January 25, 
<line: 26> 2012, due to injuries sustained in an automobile accident.  (Tr. 32, 170.)  In a function report that 
<line: 27> he submitted with his application for benefits, he reported that his daily activities are limited to 
<line: 28> pain management.  These include taking pain pills with each meal, icing his neck and shoulder, 
<line: 29> and showering.  (Tr. 197.)  In the report, Plaintiff claimed to be unable to walk for more than

[TITLE]
<line: 7> a. Automobile Accidents 

[TEXT]
<line: 9> Plaintiff testified that on January 25, 2012, he was involved in a work related accident 
<line: 10> when his truck was sideswiped.  (Tr. 18, 32, 37.)  He testified that, about a year later, he was 
<line: 11> involved in another automobile accident in which his head hit a window after he was rear-ended. 
<line: 12> He testified that he was involved in a third accident in 2013,2 in which he was again rear-ended.  
<line: 13> (Tr. 39.)  According to Plaintiff, he subsequently “did some treatment and then that was it.”  (Tr. 
<line: 14> 39.) 

[TITLE]
<line: 16> b. Emergency Room Visits  

[TEXT]
<line: 18> Plaintiff visited the emergency room of Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital on June 
<line: 19> 20, April 11, and May 4 of 2012; as well as; on January 2, August 12, and September 12 of 2014 
<line: 20> due to neck pain and headaches.  He was treated with pain medications and discharged on each 
<line: 21> occasion.  (Tr. 18, 285-313, 411-24.)   

[TEXT]
<line: 23> c. Physical Health Treatment 

[TEXT]
<line: 25> Dr. David Adin, D.O. (“Dr. Adin”), treated Plaintiff from February 1, 2012, to June 21, 
<line: 26> 2012.  (Tr. 314-23.) On February 1, Plaintiff presented complaining of neck pain, shoulder pain, 
<line: 27> and headaches.  (Tr. 315.)  He denied ever having pain in his shoulder or neck in the past.  (Tr. 
<line: 28> 315.)  Upon examination, Dr. Adin observed limited mobility and a decreased range of motion in 
<line: 29> the neck, as well as a limited range of motion in the left shoulder with positive giveaway weakness.  
<line: 30> (Tr. 316.)  There was no evidence of sensory deficits in the upper limbs.  Dr. Adin diagnosed

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Plaintiff with cervical derangement, left shoulder impingement syndrome, cervicogenic 
<line: 3> headaches, and a possible underlying traumatic brain injury.  (Tr. 315-16.)  On March 29, 2012, at 
<line: 4> the direction of Dr. Adin, Plaintiff underwent MRIs of his left shoulder and cervical spine. The 
<line: 5> MRI of the left shoulder revealed infraspinatus and supraspinatus peritendinitis, moderate 
<line: 6> hypertrophic degenerative joint disease of the acromioclavicular joint, and deficiency and 
<line: 7> irregularity of the anterior superior labrum.  (Tr. 275.)  The MRI of the cervical spine revealed a 
<line: 8> broad-based disc bulge at the C4-C5 level and central disc herniation at the C5-C6 level.  (Tr. 274.)  
<line: 9> His treatment consisted of oral analgesics, physical therapy, a hard cervical collar, a Lidoderm 
<line: 10> patch, and a series of cervical epidural injections.  (Tr. 314-23.)  

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Dr. Allen S. Glushakow, M.D. (“Dr. Glushakow”), conducted a consultative examination 
<line: 13> of Plaintiff on November 26, 2012.  (Tr. 331.)  He recorded that Plaintiff presented with complaints 
<line: 14> of his arms falling asleep, neck pain, and headaches.  (Tr. 332.)  An examination revealed mild 
<line: 15> restriction of range of motion in the neck but full range of motion in the bilateral upper and lower 
<line: 16> extremities.  (Tr. 332.)  The examination also showed a negative Phalen and Tinel’s test, no atrophy 
<line: 17> or soft tissue swelling, and no evidence of neurological deficits.  Plaintiff was also able to take his 
<line: 18> shoes off in a sitting position without difficulty.  (Tr. 332.)  Dr. Glushakow diagnosed Plaintiff 
<line: 19> with “[i]nfraspinatus and supraspinatus peritendinitis of the left shoulder with moderate 
<line: 20> hypertrophy and degenerative joint disease of the right AC joint[,] C5-C6 central disc herniation 
<line: 21> with no clinical evidence of cervical radiculitis based on positive MRI findings[, and a] subjective 
<line: 22> history of headaches.”  (Tr. 332.) 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Plaintiff first visited Dr. Edward G. Novik, M.D. (“Dr. Novik”), on April 18, 2013, for 
<line: 25> treatment related to Plaintiff’s automobile accident alleged to have occurred on April 12, 2013.  
<line: 26> (Tr. 398.)   Plaintiff told Dr. Novik that his pain was 9/10, constant, and limited his everyday

<line: 28> 4 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> activities.  (Tr. 398.)  Dr. Novik examined Plaintiff and determined that he had an antalgic gait, a 
<line: 3> limited range of motion in the neck, diminished deep tendon reflex, decreased motor strength in 
<line: 4> the upper left extremity, and a decreased range of motion in the lumbar spine.  (Tr. 18.)   

[TEXT]
<line: 6> Subsequent progress notes from Dr. Novik indicated that Plaintiff’s conditions improved 
<line: 7> with conservative therapy that consisted of oral analgesics, a series of epidural injections, a 
<line: 8> bilateral facet joint injection, and a home exercise program.  (Tr. 18, 371-403.)  Notably, on an 
<line: 9> October 3, 2013 visit, Plaintiff reported a 60% improvement in his pain after his second epidural 
<line: 10> steroid injection.  (Tr. 28, 385.)  During Plaintiff’s last visit with Dr. Novik on January 30, 2014, 
<line: 11> an examination showed a decreased range of motion in all planes of the cervical spine accompanied 
<line: 12> by muscle spasm, tenderness, pain, and a normal motor and sensory examination of the upper 
<line: 13> extremities.  However, there was no evidence of any abnormalities in Plaintiff’s gait, lumbar spine, 
<line: 14> or bilateral lower extremities.  (Tr. 18, 373.)   

[TITLE]
<line: 16> d. Mental Health Treatment 

[TEXT]
<line: 18> Plaintiff was treated by Dr. Alexander Ivanov, M.D. (“Dr. Ivanov”) from September 13, 
<line: 19> 2012 through December 13, 2012.  (Tr. 336-43)  Dr. Ivanov diagnosed Plaintiff with post-
<line: 20> traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, and an environmental driving phobia.  (Tr. 
<line: 21> 18, 338.)  Dr. Ivanov also opined that Plaintiff was “100% psychiatrically disabled.”  (Tr. 342.)  
<line: 22> Dr. Ivanov treated Plaintiff through medication and psychotherapy.  (Tr. 18, 336-62.)   
<line: 23> Dr. Steven Barnett, Ph.D (“Dr. Barnett”), treated Plaintiff in September of 2012.  (Tr. 324-
<line: 24> 30.)  On October 11, 2012, Dr. Barnett completed a psychiatric report in which he diagnosed 
<line: 25> Plaintiff with a major depressive disorder, DSM-IV 296.23, severe without psychotic features.  
<line: 26> (Tr. 324.)   He noted that Plaintiff’s mood was depressed and agitated, his speech was tangential, 
<line: 27> and his concentration and memory were below average.  Plaintiff reported suicidal ideation but 

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> 5 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> denied intent due to his children.  Dr. Barnett also noted that Plaintiff was able to articulate feelings 
<line: 3> and provide history, had no limitations in social interaction, had average judgment and intellect, 
<line: 4> and was fully oriented.  (Tr. 325-28.)

<line: 7> LEGAL STANDARD 

[TITLE]
<line: 9> A. Standard of Review 

[TEXT]
<line: 11> In Social Security appeals, this Court has plenary review of the legal issues decided by the 
<line: 12> Commissioner.  Knepp v. Apfel, 204 F.3d 78, 83 (3d Cir. 2000).  Yet, this Court’s review of the 
<line: 13> ALJ’s factual findings is limited to determining whether there is substantial evidence to support 
<line: 14> those conclusions.  Hartranft v. Apfel, 181 F.3d 358, 360 (3d Cir. 1999).   

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Substantial evidence “does not mean a large or considerable amount of evidence, but rather 
<line: 17> such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.”  
<line: 18> Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 565 (1988) (internal citation and quotations omitted).  Thus, 
<line: 19> substantial evidence is “less than a preponderance of the evidence, but ‘more than a mere 
<line: 20> scintilla.’”  Bailey v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., 354 F. App’x. 613, 616 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting 
<line: 21> Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401 (1971)).  Importantly, “[t]his standard is not met if the 
<line: 22> Commissioner ‘ignores, or fails to resolve, a conflict created by countervailing evidence.’”  Bailey, 
<line: 23> 354 F. App’x. at 616 (quoting Kent v. Schweiker, 710 F.2d 110, 114 (3d Cir. 1983)).  However, if 
<line: 24> the factual record is adequately developed, “the possibility of drawing two inconsistent 
<line: 25> conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency’s finding from being 
<line: 26> supported by substantial evidence.”  Daniels v. Astrue, No. 4:08-cv-1676, 2009 WL 1011587, at 
<line: 27> *2 (M.D. Pa. Apr. 15, 2009) (quoting Consolo v. Fed. Mar. Comm’n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966) 
<line: 28> (internal quotation marks omitted)).  “The ALJ’s decision may not be set aside merely because [a 
<line: 29> reviewing court] would have reached a different decision.”  Cruz v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., 244 F. 

[ABANDON]
<line: 31> 6 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> App’x. 475, 479 (3d Cir. 2007) (citing Hartranft, 181 F.3d at 360).  This Court is required to give 
<line: 3> substantial weight and deference to the ALJ’s findings. See Scott v. Astrue, 297 F. App’x. 126, 128 
<line: 4> (3d Cir. 2008).  Nonetheless, “where there is conflicting evidence, the ALJ must explain which 
<line: 5> evidence he accepts and which he rejects, and the reasons for that determination.” Cruz, 244 F. 
<line: 6> App’x. at 479 (citing Hargenrader v. Califano, 575 F.2d 434, 437 (3d Cir. 1978)). 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> In considering an appeal from a denial of benefits, remand is appropriate “where relevant, 
<line: 9> probative and available evidence was not explicitly weighed in arriving at a decision on the 
<line: 10> plaintiff’s claim for disability benefits.”  Dobrowolsky v. Califano, 606 F.2d 403, 407 (3d Cir. 
<line: 11> 1979) (quoting Saldana v. Weinberger, 421 F. Supp. 1127, 1131 (E.D. Pa. 1976) (internal 
<line: 12> quotation marks omitted).  Indeed, a decision to “award benefits should be made only when the 
<line: 13> administrative record of the case has been fully developed and when substantial evidence on the 
<line: 14> record as a whole indicates that the claimant is disabled and entitled to benefits.”  Podedworny v. 
<line: 15> Harris, 745 F.2d 210, 221–22 (3d Cir. 1984) (citations omitted).  

[TITLE]
<line: 17> B. The Five-Step Disability Test 

[TEXT]
<line: 19> A claimant’s eligibility for social security benefits is governed by 42 U.S.C. § 1382.   An 
<line: 20> individual will be considered disabled under the Act if the claimant is unable “to engage in any 
<line: 21> substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental 
<line: 22> impairment” lasting continuously for at least twelve months. 42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(1)(A).  The 
<line: 23> impairment must be severe enough to render the individual “not only unable to do his previous 
<line: 24> work but [unable], considering his age, education, and work experience, [to] engage in any kind 
<line: 25> of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.”  42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(2)(A).  A 
<line: 26> claimant must show that the “medical signs and findings” related to his or her ailment have been 
<line: 27> “established by medically acceptable clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques, which show the 

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> 7 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> existence of a medical impairment that results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological 
<line: 3> abnormalities which could reasonably be expected to produce the pain or other symptoms alleged 
<line: 4> . . . . ”  42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(5)(A). 

[TEXT]
<line: 6> To make a disability determination, the ALJ follows a five-step sequential analysis.  20 
<line: 7> C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(a), 416.920(a); see also Cruz, 244 F. App’x at 480.  If the ALJ determines at 
<line: 8> any step that the claimant is or is not disabled, the ALJ does not proceed to the next step.   20 
<line: 9> C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(a)(4), 416.920(a)(4). 

[TEXT]
<line: 11> Step one requires the ALJ to determine whether the claimant is engaging in substantial 
<line: 12> gainful activity (“SGA”).  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(a)(4)(i), 416.920(a)(4)(i).  SGA is defined as 
<line: 13> work that “[i]nvolves doing significant and productive physical or mental duties . . . for pay or 
<line: 14> profit.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1510, 416.910.  If the claimant engages in SGA, the claimant is not 
<line: 15> disabled for purposes of receiving social security benefits regardless of the severity of the 
<line: 16> claimant’s impairments.  See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(a)(4)(i), 416.920(a)(4)(i).  If the individual is 
<line: 17> not engaging in SGA, the ALJ proceeds to step two.  

[TEXT]
<line: 19> Under step two, the ALJ determines whether the claimant suffers from a severe impairment 
<line: 20> or combination of impairments that meets the duration requirement found in Sections 404.1509 
<line: 21> and 416.909. 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(a)(4)(ii), 416.920(a)(4)(ii).  An impairment or a combination 
<line: 22> of impairments is not severe when medical and other evidence establishes only a slight abnormality 
<line: 23> or combination of abnormalities that would have a minimal effect on an individual’s ability to 
<line: 24> work.   20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1521, 416.921; Social Security Rule (“SSR”) 85-28, 96-3p, 96-4p.  An 
<line: 25> impairment or a combination of impairments is severe when it significantly limits the claimant’s 
<line: 26> “physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(c), 416.920(c).  If 
<line: 27> the ALJ does not find severe impairment or combination of impairments, the claimant is not 

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> 8 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> disabled.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(a)(4)(ii), 416.920(a)(4)(ii).  If the ALJ finds a severe impairment 
<line: 3> or combination of impairments, the ALJ then proceeds to step three. 

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Under step three, the ALJ determines whether the claimant’s impairment or combination 
<line: 6> of impairments is equal to, or exceeds, one of those included in the Listing of Impairments in 20 
<line: 7> C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(a)(4)(iii), 416.920(a)(4)(iii).  If an impairment or combination of impairments 
<line: 8> meets the statutory criteria of a listed impairment as well as the duration requirement, the claimant 
<line: 9> is disabled and entitled to benefits.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(d), 416.920(d).  If, however, the 
<line: 10> claimant’s impairment or combination of impairments does not meet the severity of the listed 
<line: 11> impairment, or if the duration is insufficient, the ALJ proceeds to the next step.  

[TEXT]
<line: 13> Before undergoing the analysis in step four, the ALJ must determine the claimant’s residual 
<line: 14> functional capacity (“RFC”).  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(a), 404.1520(e), 416.920(a), 416.920(e).  An 
<line: 15> individual’s RFC is the individual’s ability to do physical and mental work activities on a sustained 
<line: 16> basis despite limitations from his or her impairments.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1545, 416.945.  The ALJ 
<line: 17> considers all impairments in this analysis, not just those deemed to be severe.  20 C.F.R. §§ 
<line: 18> 404.1545(a)(2), 416.945(a)(2); SSR 96-8p.  After determining a claimant’s RFC, step four then 
<line: 19> requires the ALJ to determine whether the claimant has the RFC to perform the requirements of 
<line: 20> his or her past relevant work. 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(e)-(f), 416.920(e)-(f).  If the claimant is able 
<line: 21> to perform his or her past relevant work, he or she will not be found disabled under the Act.  20 
<line: 22> C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(a)(4)(iv), 404.1520(f), 416.920(a)(4)(iv), 416.920(f).  If the claimant is unable 
<line: 23> to resume his or her past work, the disability evaluation proceeds to the fifth and final step.  

[TEXT]
<line: 25> At step five, the ALJ must determine whether the claimant is able to do any other work, 
<line: 26> considering his or her RFC, age, education, and work experience.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(a)(4)(v), 
<line: 27> 416.920(a)(4)(v).  Unlike in the first four steps of the analysis where the claimant bears the burden 

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> 9 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> of persuasion, the burden shifts to the ALJ at step five to determine whether the claimant is capable 
<line: 3> of performing an alternative SGA present in the national economy.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(g)(1) 
<line: 4> (citing 404.1560(c)), 416.920(g)(1) (citing 416.960(c)); Kangas v. Bowen, 823 F.2d 775, 777 (3d 
<line: 5> Cir. 1987).  At this point in the analysis, the Social Security Administration (“SSA”) is 
<line: 6> “responsible for providing evidence that demonstrates that other work exists in significant numbers 
<line: 7> in the national economy that [the claimant] can do, given [the claimant’s RFC] and vocational 
<line: 8> factors.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(c)(2), 416.960(c)(2).  If the claimant is unable to do any other 
<line: 9> SGA, he or she is disabled.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(a)(4)(v), 416.920(a)(4)(v).

<line: 12> DISCUSSION 

[TITLE]
<line: 14> A. The ALJ’s Decision 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Under step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff has not engaged in substantial gainful 
<line: 17> activity since January 25, 2012, the alleged disability onset date.  (Tr. 14); see 20 C.F.R. § 
<line: 18> 404.1571 et seq.  Under step two, the ALJ considered the entire medical record in determining that 
<line: 19> Plaintiff has the following severe impairments: disorder of the back (cervical and lumbar); 
<line: 20> headaches; internal derangement of the right shoulder; and depression.  (Tr. 14); see 20 C.F.R. § 
<line: 21> 404.120(c).  These findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record.  Furthermore, once 
<line: 22> the ALJ determined which of Plaintiff’s impairments qualified as severe, she considered, under 
<line: 23> step three, whether Plaintiff’s severe impairments equal or exceed those in the Listing of 
<line: 24> Impairments in the Act.  See C.F.R. § 416.920(a)(4)(iii). 

[TEXT]
<line: 26> Under step three, ALJ Krappa determined that Plaintiff does not have an impairment or 
<line: 27> combination of impairments that meets or medically equals the severity of one of the listed 
<line: 28> impairments in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1.  (Tr. 14); see 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(d), 
<line: 29> 404.1525 and 404.1526.  Specifically, it was found that the requirements of listing 1.04 have not 

[ABANDON]
<line: 31> 10 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> been met because the evidence fails to demonstrate the existence of a herniated nucleus pulposus, 
<line: 3> spinal arachnoiditis, spinal stenosis, osteoarthritis, degenerative disc disease, facet arthritis, or 
<line: 4> vertebral fracture, along with the requirements of subsection A, B, or C of the listing.  (Tr. 15.)  
<line: 5> The subsection A requirement is evidence of nerve root compression characterized by neuro-
<line: 6> anatomic distribution of pain, limitation of motion of the spine, motor loss (atrophy with associated 
<line: 7> muscle weakness or muscle weakness) accompanied by sensory or reflex loss and, if there is 
<line: 8> involvement of the lower back, a positive straight-leg raising test (sitting and supine).  The 
<line: 9> subsection B requirement is spinal arachnoiditis, confirmed by an operative note or pathology 
<line: 10> report of tissue biopsy, or by appropriate medically acceptable imaging, manifested by severe 
<line: 11> burning or painful dysesthesia, resulting in the need for changes in position or posture more than 
<line: 12> once every 2 hours.  The subsection C requirement is lumbar spinal stenosis resulting in 
<line: 13> pseudoclaudication, established by findings on appropriate medically acceptable imaging, 
<line: 14> manifested by chronic nonradicular pain and weakness, and resulting in inability to ambulate 
<line: 15> effectively, as defined in 1.00B2b.  20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1.  

[TEXT]
<line: 17> ALJ Krappa also found that Plaintiff’s right shoulder impairment does not meet the 
<line: 18> requirements of listing 1.02 because there is no evidence of a gross anatomical deformity and 
<line: 19> chronic joint pain and stiffness with signs of limitation of motion or other abnormal motion of the 
<line: 20> affected joint(s), and findings on appropriate medically acceptable imaging of joint space 
<line: 21> narrowing, bony destruction, or ankylosis of the affected joint, along with subsections A or B of 
<line: 22> the listing.  (Tr. 15.)  The subsection A requirement is involvement of one major peripheral weight-
<line: 23> bearing joint, resulting in inability to ambulate effectively, as defined in 1.00B2b. The subsection 
<line: 24> B requirement is involvement of one major peripheral joint in each upper extremity, resulting in 
<line: 25> inability to perform fine and gross movements effectively, as defined in 1.00B2c.  20 C.F.R. Part 

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 11 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1.  

[TEXT]
<line: 4> Finally, ALJ Krappa found that the requirements of listing 12.04 were not met because 
<line: 5> neither the subsection B nor the subsection C requirements were met. In order to satisfy the 
<line: 6> requirements of listing 12.04, either the requirements of both subsections A and B must be 
<line: 7> satisfied, or the requirements of subsection C must be satisfied.  20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, 
<line: 8> Appendix 1.  To satisfy the subsection B criteria, Plaintiff’s mental impairments must result in at 
<line: 9> least two of the following: marked restriction of activities of daily living; marked difficulties in 
<line: 10> maintaining social functioning; marked difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or 
<line: 11> pace; or repeated episodes of decompensation, each of extended duration.  The ALJ found that 
<line: 12> Plaintiff’s mental impairments do not cause at least two “marked” limitations or one “marked” 
<line: 13> limitation and “repeated” episodes of decompensation, each of an extended duration.  (Tr. 15.)  To 
<line: 14> satisfy the subsection C criteria, Plaintiff’s depression must result in (1) “repeated episodes of 
<line: 15> decompensation, each of an extended duration”; (2) “[a] residual disease process that has resulted 
<line: 16> in such marginal adjustment that even a minimal increase in mental demands or change in the 
<line: 17> environment would be predicted to cause the individual to decompensate; or (3) [c]urrent history 
<line: 18> of 1 or more years' inability to function outside a highly supportive living arrangement, with an 
<line: 19> indication of continued need for such an arrangement.”   20 C.F.R. § 404, subpt. P, app. 1., § 
<line: 20> 12.04(C).  The ALJ found that the evidence failed to establish any of these criteria.  (Tr. 16.) 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff’s residual functional 
<line: 23> capacity allows him to perform the exertional demands of light work as defined in 20 C.F.R. § 
<line: 24> 404.1567(b).  Specifically, the ALJ found that Plaintiff is able to “lift/carry 20 lbs. occasionally 
<line: 25> and 10 lbs. frequently; stand/walk for 6 hours in an eight hour work day; sit for 6 hours in an eight 
<line: 26> hour work day (if given the opportunity at the 45 min. – 1 hr. mark to stand and stretch for 3-5 

[ABANDON]
<line: 28> 12 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> minutes); and perform unlimited pushing and pulling within the weight restriction given.”  (Tr. 
<line: 3> 16.)  She also determined that Plaintiff is able to perform jobs that require frequent use of ladders, 
<line: 4> ropes, or scaffolds; that require frequent use of ramps or stairs; and that require unlimited 
<line: 5> balancing, stooping, kneeling, and crouching, but only frequent crawling.  (Tr. 16.)  Finally, she 
<line: 6> found that Plaintiff can perform jobs that are simple and repetitive, and that require only occasional 
<line: 7> contact with supervisors, but no contact with the general public.  (Tr. 16.)  In making these 
<line: 8> findings, the ALJ considered all of Plaintiff’s symptoms and the extent to which these symptoms 
<line: 9> can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence and other evidence 
<line: 10> based on the requirements of 20 C.F.R. § 404.1529 and SSRs 96-4p and 96-7p.  She also 
<line: 11> considered opinion evidence in accordance with the requirements of 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527 and 
<line: 12> SSRs 96-2p, 96-5p, 96-6p, and 06-3p.  (Tr. 16.) 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> Under step four, ALJ Krappa determined that Plaintiff is unable to perform any past 
<line: 15> relevant work under 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520(f).  In reaching this conclusion, the ALJ considered the 
<line: 16> testimony of the vocational expert, Jackie Wilson, M.S., which referenced the residual functional 
<line: 17> capacity.  Because the ALJ determined that Plaintiff cannot perform his past relevant work, her 
<line: 18> analysis proceeded to step five to determine whether work exists in the national economy that 
<line: 19> Plaintiff could perform.  See 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520(g) 

[TEXT]
<line: 21> At step five, ALJ Krappa found that Plaintiff can perform work that exists in significant 
<line: 22> numbers in the national economy.  In coming to this conclusion, the ALJ considered Plaintiff’s 
<line: 23> residual functional capacity, age, education, and work experience in conjunction with the Medical-
<line: 24> Vocational Guidelines, 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 2.  (Tr. 21.)  The vocational expert 
<line: 25> took into consideration the ALJ’s hypothetical that included Plaintiff’s impediments that hinder 
<line: 26> his ability to perform the full range of light work.  In doing so, the vocational expert determined 

[ABANDON]
<line: 28> 13 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> that a person with Plaintiff’s impediments would nonetheless be able to perform the job 
<line: 3> requirements of unskilled jobs in the light exertional range such as inspector/hand packager, 
<line: 4> photocopying machine operator, and sealing and canceling machine operator.  (Tr. 55.)  Because 
<line: 5> a significant number of these jobs exist in the national economy and Plaintiff has the capability to 
<line: 6> make a successful adjustment, ALJ Krappa found him to be “not disabled.”  (Tr. 22.) 

[TITLE]
<line: 8> B. The ALJ’s Factual Findings are Supported by Substantial Credible Evidence 
<line: 9> and Her Legal Conclusions are Correct 

[TEXT]
<line: 11> Plaintiff contends that substantial evidence in the administrative record establishes that he 
<line: 12> is entitled to DIB and requests that this Court reverse and order the payment of benefits or, in the 
<line: 13> alternative, reverse and remand this matter for further proceedings.  (Pl.’s Br. at 9.)  Plaintiff seeks 
<line: 14> reversal based on two arguments.  First, Plaintiff argues that the ALJ’s step three listings evaluation 
<line: 15> is “beyond judicial review.”  (Pl.’s Br. at 15.)  Second, Plaintiff contends that the RFC is not based 
<line: 16> on substantial evidence and the resulting hypothetical presented to the vocational expert is 
<line: 17> inaccurate.  (See Pl.’s Br. at 24.)  This Court considers both arguments in turn. 

[TITLE]
<line: 19> 1. The ALJ Properly Analyzed Each Step Three Listing and Properly 
<line: 20> Considered the Combination of Ailments 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> As discussed supra, the ALJ properly considered Plaintiff’s impairments under listings 
<line: 23> 1.02, 1.04, and 12.04, and she correctly found that he did not meet all of the required criteria.  
<line: 24> According to Plaintiff, ALJ Krappa did not sufficiently articulate her reasons for finding that 
<line: 25> Plaintiff lacked an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled a 
<line: 26> listed impairment.  (Pl.’s Br. at 10-12, 15-23).  However, to be found presumptively disabled, a 
<line: 27> claimant must show that all of the criteria for a listing have been met.  See 20 C.F.R. § 
<line: 28> 404.1525(c)(3).  Here, the ALJ properly considered Plaintiff’s impairments under Listings 1.02, 

[ABANDON]
<line: 30> 14 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> 1.04, and 12.04 and correctly found that he did not meet all of the required criteria.  

[TEXT]
<line: 4> In analyzing the evidence before her, ALJ Krappa found that Plaintiff’s medically 
<line: 5> determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause his alleged symptoms, but that 
<line: 6> his statements concerning the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of these symptoms are not 
<line: 7> entirely credible.  (Tr. 19.)  Plaintiff alleged disability partially due to injuries that he sustained in 
<line: 8> various automobile accidents.  (Tr. 30.)  However, his treating sources were of the opinion that 
<line: 9> conservative therapy was adequate to treat his C5-6 disc herniation and that he was not a candidate 
<line: 10> for surgical intervention.  (Tr. 19.)  Additionally, Dr. Novik’s notes report that Plaintiff’s 
<line: 11> symptoms from both his January 2012 and April 2013 accidents improved with another course of 
<line: 12> conservative therapy.  (Tr. 19.)  Similarly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff’s testimony that he could 
<line: 13> only stand ½ hour, sit ½ hour, walk ½ hour, and lift ½ gallon of milk was inconsistent with the 
<line: 14> findings of Dr. Glushakow’s November 2012 examination that noted that Plaintiff was able to 
<line: 15> walk with a normal unassisted gait and station, that he had full range of motion in the bilateral 
<line: 16> upper and lower extremities, and that he was able to take his shoes off in a sitting position with no 
<line: 17> difficulty.  (Tr. 19.)  Furthermore, Dr. Novik’s January 2014 examination noted no abnormalities 
<line: 18> or functional limitations related to Plaintiff’s lumbar spine or bilateral lower extremities after his 
<line: 19> automobile accidents in 2012 and 2013.  (Tr. 19.)   

[TEXT]
<line: 21> Concerning Plaintiff’s alleged psychiatric disabilities, the ALJ found that the credible 
<line: 22> evidence did not support a finding of disability.  She properly gave little weight to Dr. Ivanov’s 
<line: 23> opinion that Plaintiff is “100% psychiatrically disabled.”  Dr. Ivanov only treated Plaintiff for three 
<line: 24> months.  In addition, there is no record of any recurrent emergency room or inpatient 
<line: 25> hospitalizations due to an exacerbation of his psychiatric symptoms.  However, the ALJ did take 
<line: 26> into consideration Plaintiff’s subjective complaints as well as Dr. Barnett’s psychological 

[ABANDON]
<line: 28> 15 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> diagnoses and determined that Plaintiff is capable of simple tasks in a low contact environment 
<line: 3> involving occasional contact with supervisors but no contact with the general public.  (Tr. 20.)  

[TEXT]
<line: 5> These shortfalls in Plaintiff’s medical evidence allowed ALJ Krappa to conclude that 
<line: 6> Plaintiff did not meet the requirements of listings 1.02, 1.04, or 12.04.  In regard to listing 1.02, 
<line: 7> Plaintiff’s January 2012 MRI of his left shoulder revealed infraspinatus and supraspinatus 
<line: 8> peritendinitis, moderate hypertrophic degenerative joint disease of the acromioclavicular joint, and 
<line: 9> deficiency and irregularity of the anterior superior labrum, but there was no joint space narrowing, 
<line: 10> bony destruction or ankyloses as required by the listing.  (Tr. 275.)  Plaintiff’s shoulder 
<line: 11> examination in November 2012 was normal and his examination in January 2014 revealed normal 
<line: 12> motor strength and sensory examinations in both upper extremities.  (Tr. 334, 373.)  In regard to 
<line: 13> listing 1.04, Plaintiff’s November 2012 examination revealed only a mild restriction in cervical 
<line: 14> range of motion.  (Tr. 332.)  Examinations that took place more recently revealed improvement in 
<line: 15> his condition.  (Tr. 373, 377, 385.)  In regard to listing 12.04, Plaintiff does not satisfy section B 
<line: 16> because his mental impairments do not cause at least two “marked” limitations or one “marked” 
<line: 17> limitation and “repeated” episode of decompensation, each of extended duration.  20 C.F.R. pt. 
<line: 18> 404, subpt. P app. 1, § 12.04B.  Plaintiff  does not satisfy subsections C(1) and C(2) because there 
<line: 19> is no evidence of repeated episodes of decompensation each of extended duration and there is no 
<line: 20> evidence that “a minimal increase in mental demands or change in the environment would be 
<line: 21> predicted to cause the individual to decompensate.”  20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P app. 1, § 
<line: 22> 12.04(C)(2).  In addition, Plaintiff is unable to satisfy the requirements of subsection C(3) because 

[ABANDON]
<line: 24> 16 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> he lives independently and is able to care for his personal needs, care for his pets, go out alone, 
<line: 3> and handle his financial affairs.  (Tr. 15, 198, 224, 226-27.) 

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Finally, Plaintiff alleges that ALJ Krappa did not consider his ailments in combination.  
<line: 6> (Tr. 18.)  However, an ALJ need not “use particular language or adhere to a particular format in 
<line: 7> conducting his analysis . . . [so far as] there is sufficient development of the record and explanation 
<line: 8> of findings to permit meaningful review.”   Jones v. Barnhart, 364 F.3d 501, 505 (3d Cir. 2004).  
<line: 9> Here, the ALJ considered Plaintiff’s ailments separately and in combination and determined that 
<line: 10> they do not meet or medically equal the severity of a listed impairment.  (Tr. 14-16.)   

[TITLE]
<line: 12> 2. Substantial Evidence Supports the ALJ’s RFC Determination 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> Plaintiff argues that certain findings in the ALJ’s RFC ignore evidence in the record.  (Pl.’s 
<line: 15> Br. 27-28.)  However, “the ALJ need only include in the RFC those limitations which he finds to 
<line: 16> be credible.”  Salles v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., 229 F. App’x 140, 147 (3d Cir. 2007).  In addition, 
<line: 17> “where there is conflicting evidence, the ALJ must explain which evidence he accepts and which 
<line: 18> he rejects, and the reasons for that determination.”  Cruz v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., 244 F. App’x. 
<line: 19> 475, 479 (3d Cir. 2007) (citing Hargenrader v. Califano, 575 F.2d 434, 437 (3d Cir. 1978)).  Here, 
<line: 20> the ALJ referenced the credible evidence in the record, including medical treatment from the same 
<line: 21> doctors over an extended period of time, and compared Plaintiff’s subjective complaints to his 
<line: 22> daily activities when making her RFC determination.  (See Tr. 16-20.)  In addition, as discussed 
<line: 23> supra, the ALJ explained why she gave little weight to Dr. Ivanov’s findings.  (Tr. 20.)   Using 
<line: 24> this evidence, the ALJ constructed a detailed RFC that limits Plaintiff to light work with the 
<line: 25> additional limitations that he  must be given the opportunity every 45 minutes to one hour to stand 
<line: 26> and stretch for three to five minutes; can only reach occasionally overhead with both arms; can 
<line: 27> frequently reach in front and laterally to 18 inches; can frequently use ladders, ropes or scaffolds; 
<line: 28> can frequently climb ramps or stairs; can frequently crawl; is unlimited for balancing, stooping, 

[ABANDON]
<line: 30> 17 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> kneeling and crouching; can perform jobs that were simple and repetitive and required only 
<line: 3> occasional contact with supervisors but no contact with the general public; cannot perform quick 
<line: 4> movements with his head; and is only able to rotate his head side-to-side up to 45 degrees, but his 
<line: 5> whole body can be moved to look side-to-side.  (Tr. 16.)  It is also important to note that the RFC 
<line: 6> is an administrative finding and not a medical decision, and the ALJ’s decision must not be set 
<line: 7> aside simply because “[a reviewing court] would have reached a different decision.”  Cruz, 244 F. 
<line: 8> App’x. at 479 (citing Hartranft, 181 F.3d at 360).  The possibility of another ALJ reaching a 
<line: 9> different determination from the credible evidence on record is not reason enough for ALJ 
<line: 10> Krappa’s decision to be set aside.  

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Plaintiff also claims that, because his RFC was allegedly improperly constructed, the 
<line: 13> hypothetical given to the vocational expert does not include the entirety of his mental disabilities 
<line: 14> and therefore does not sufficiently represent his limitations.  (Pl.’s Br. at 31.)  However, Plaintiff 
<line: 15> does not specify which of these additional limitations the ALJ allegedly should have included in 
<line: 16> her hypothetical.  Similar to the construction of the RFC, the ALJ must only consider credibly 
<line: 17> established limitations when constructing the hypothetical presented to the vocational expert. 
<line: 18> Rutherford v. Barnhart, 399 F.3d 546, 554 (3d Cir. 2005).  Here, the ALJ included all of Plaintiff’s 
<line: 19> credibly established mental limitations when she presented her hypothetical to the vocational 
<line: 20> expert.  (Tr. 54.)  The ALJ’s hypothetical limited Plaintiff to simple and repetitive tasks that 
<line: 21> required only occasional contact with supervisors and no contact with the general public, which 
<line: 22> was supported by Dr. Barnett’s credible opinion that Plaintiff had below-average memory and 
<line: 23> concentration and would have difficulty coping with stressful situations.  (Tr. 54, 325.)   The 
<line: 24> vocational expert took into account the credibly established limitations that the ALJ presented in 
<line: 25> her hypothetical when determining that a person with Plaintiff’s limitations would be able to 

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 18 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> perform certain jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy. Therefore, ALJ 
<line: 3> Krappa properly formulated both Plaintiff’s RFC and the hypothetical presented to the vocational 
<line: 4> expert. 

[TITLE]
<line: 6> IV. 
<line: 7> CONCLUSION 

[TEXT]
<line: 9> Because this Court finds that ALJ Krappa’s factual findings are supported by substantial 
<line: 10> credible evidence in the record and that her legal conclusions are correct, the Commissioner’s 
<line: 11> determination is AFFIRMED.
