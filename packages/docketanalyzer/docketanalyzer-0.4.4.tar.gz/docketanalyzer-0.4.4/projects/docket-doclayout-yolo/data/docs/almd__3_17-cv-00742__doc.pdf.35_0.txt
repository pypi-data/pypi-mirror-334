<line: 30> MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 32> Before the court is the Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge that the court 
<line: 33> deny Petitioner Kenneth Allen Ballard’s 28 U.S.C. § 2255 motion as untimely under 
<line: 34> 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(1) or, alternatively, on the merits.  (Doc. # 33.)  Mr.  Ballard 
<line: 35> timely filed objections.  (Doc. #34.)  Based upon a de novo review of those portions 
<line: 36> of the Recommendation to which objection is made, 28 U.S.C. § 636, the court finds 
<line: 37> that the Recommendation addresses and properly rejects the arguments underlying 
<line: 38> Mr. Ballard’s objections and that the objections lack merit.   

[TITLE]
<line: 40> I.  BACKGROUND 

[TEXT]
<line: 42> In January 2011, Mr. Ballard was sentenced to 210 months on his convictions, 
<line: 43> after a trial by jury, on two counts of knowingly distributing child pornography and 
<line: 44> on one count of knowingly receiving child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
<line: 45> § 2252A(a)(2).  At the sentencing hearing, over his objection, Mr. Ballard received 1231231

[TEXT]
<line: 4> a five-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) based on a finding that 
<line: 5> his offense involved distribution of child pornography “for the receipt, or 
<line: 6> expectation of receipt, of a thing of value, but not for pecuniary gain.”  
<line: 7> § 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) (2010); see United States v. Kenneth Allen Ballard, 3:09cr159-
<line: 8> WKW (M.D. Ala. Jan. 24, 2011) (Judgment).1 

[TEXT]
<line: 10> Mr. Ballard appealed.  The three issues he raised on appeal did not include a 
<line: 11> challenge to the application of the five-level enhancement under § 2G2.2(b)(3)(B).  
<line: 12> On December 15, 2011, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the judgment of conviction 
<line: 13> and sentence.  See United States v. Ballard, 448 F. App’x 987 (11th Cir. 2011).  Mr. 
<line: 14> Ballard did not seek certiorari review in the United States Supreme Court. 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> In his § 2255 motion, Mr. Ballard claims he is entitled to retroactive 
<line: 17> application of the Sentencing Commission’s November 2016 clarifying amendment 
<line: 18> to § 2G2.2(b)(3)(B), Amendment 801.  He argues that Amendment 801 solidifies 
<line: 19> that the facts of his case do not warrant the five-level enhancement.2  According to 
<line: 20> Mr. Ballard, the incorrect application of the § 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) enhancement amounts

<line: 25> 2 Amendment 801 to the Sentencing Guidelines, effective November 1, 2016, amended 
<line: 26> § 2G2.2(b)(3)(B).  It clarifies that the five-level increase is warranted where “the defendant agreed 
<line: 27> to an exchange with another person under which the defendant knowingly distributed to that other 
<line: 28> person for the specific purpose of obtaining something of valuable consideration from that other 
<line: 29> person, such as other child pornographic material.”  See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, app.

<line: 5> 801, Mr. Ballard objects to the Magistrate Judge’s Recommendation that his motion 
<line: 6> is untimely under 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(1) and, alternatively, lacks merit.  The 
<line: 7> objections are due to be overruled. 

[TITLE]
<line: 9> II.  DISCUSSION 

[TEXT]
<line: 11> Under § 2255(f), which establishes a one-year statute of limitations for § 2255 
<line: 12> motions, the “limitation period shall run from the latest of” the following: 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> (1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final; 
<line: 15> (2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by 
<line: 16> governmental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the 
<line: 17> United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from making a 
<line: 18> motion by such governmental action; 
<line: 19> (3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the 
<line: 20> Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme 
<line: 21> Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; 
<line: 22> or 
<line: 23> (4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented 
<line: 24> could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence. 

[TEXT]
<line: 26> § 2255(f)(1)–(4).  The one-year statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling 
<line: 27> if the movant shows “(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that 
<line: 28> some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.” 
<line: 29> Thomas v. Attorney Gen., Fla., 795 F.3d 1286, 1291 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting 
<line: 30> Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 649 (2010)).  However, “[e]quitable tolling is an 
<line: 31> extraordinary remedy and is applied sparingly.”  Outler v. United States, 485 F.3d 
<line: 32> 1273, 1280 (11th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted).

[TEXT]
<line: 4> Applying the foregoing principles, the Magistrate Judge finds that 
<line: 5> § 2255(f)(1) governs Mr. Ballard’s motion.  There is no dispute that Mr. Ballard’s 
<line: 6> conviction and sentence became final on March 14, 2012, for purposes of 
<line: 7> § 2255(f)(1).  Under subsection (f)(1), Mr. Ballard had until March 14, 2013, to file 
<line: 8> a § 2255 motion.  Because Mr. Ballard did not file his § 2255 motion until October 
<line: 9> 31, 2017, more than four years after the limitation period in had expired, the 
<line: 10> Magistrate Judge recommends that Mr. Ballard’s motion be denied as untimely.  The 
<line: 11> Magistrate Judge also finds that Mr. Ballard’s untimely motion does not qualify for 
<line: 12> equitable tolling.3  Alternatively, the Magistrate Judge finds that the motion lacks 
<line: 13> substantive merit.   

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Mr. Ballard’s objections essentially are the same as the arguments he made 
<line: 16> before the Magistrate Judge.  The court carefully has reviewed the Recommendation 
<line: 17> in light of Mr. Ballard’s objections and finds that they are without merit based on 
<line: 18> the reasons ably articulated by the Magistrate Judge.  Three points are illustrated.  

[TEXT]
<line: 20> First, Mr. Ballard argues that, contrary to the Recommendation’s finding, his 
<line: 21> motion “should be considered timely” because he filed it within one year of 
<line: 22> Amendment 801’s issuance, thus, suggesting that § 2255(f)(4) reset the statute-of-
<line: 23> limitations clock.  (Doc. # 34, at 3.)  The Recommendation, however, cites ample 

[ABANDON]
<line: 25> 3 Mr. Ballard does not contest that his § 2255 motion is time-barred if § 2255(f)(1) controls 
<line: 26> the clock and if equitable tolling does not apply.

<line: 4> authority that persuasively demonstrates that a clarifying amendment, like 
<line: 5> Amendment 801, is not a “fact” for purposes of § 2255(f)(4).  (See Doc. # 33, at 7–
<line: 6> 8 (collecting cases).)  To the extent that Mr. Ballard also argues for application of § 
<line: 7> 2255(f)(3), that objection likewise lacks merit.  See Doak v. United States, No. 
<line: 8> 611CR273ORL28GJK, 2018 WL 5633997, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 31, 2018) 
<line: 9> (“Amendment 801 . . . is an amendment to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, 
<line: 10> not a right recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States and made 
<line: 11> retroactive to cases on collateral review.  Consequently, § 2255(f)(3) is not 
<line: 12> applicable.”); (see also Doc. # 33, at 8 n.3.)  The Recommendation correctly finds 
<line: 13> that § 2255(f)(1) governs the statute of limitations for Mr. Ballard’s § 2255 motion 
<line: 14> and that his motion is untimely.  

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Second, the Magistrate Judge appropriately finds that equitable tolling cannot 
<line: 17> save Mr. Ballard’s untimely motion.  (Doc. # 33, at 8–9.)  If it is assumed that 
<line: 18> Amendment 801 effectuated a change in law, the Recommendation perceptively 
<line: 19> pens that “a purported change in law is not an extraordinary circumstance for 
<line: 20> equitable tolling purposes.”  (Doc. # 33, at 9 (citing, among other cases, Outler v. 
<line: 21> United States, 485 F.3d 1273 (11th Cir. 2007).)  Mr. Ballard contends, though, that 
<line: 22> Amendment 801 presents an extraordinary circumstance justifying equitable tolling 
<line: 23> because its clarification proves that the five-level enhancement was wrongly applied 
<line: 24> in his case.  This argument parallels the petitioner’s in Outler—i.e., that the “change

[TEXT]
<line: 4> of law demonstrates that long-closed previous litigation was decided against him 
<line: 5> incorrectly.”  Outler, 485 F.3d at 1281.  Even if Mr. Ballard were correct that the 
<line: 6> sentencing court erred in applying the five-level enhancement, he has not shown that 
<line: 7> the purported change in law is “any more extraordinary” than the change of law that 
<line: 8> the Outler court deemed insufficient to equitably toll § 2255(f)’s limitation period.  
<line: 9> Id. at 1282.   

[TEXT]
<line: 11> Moreover, as to equitable tolling’s element of due diligence, Mr. Ballard does 
<line: 12> not dispute that the three issues he raised on appeal did not encompass a challenge 
<line: 13> to the five-level enhancement under § 2G2.2(b)(3)(B).  Rather, he points out that, in 
<line: 14> his appellate brief, he noted generally the sentencing court’s overruling of his 
<line: 15> objections to the presentence report as part of his argument challenging the 
<line: 16> reasonableness of his sentence and that he alluded to § 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) when he 
<line: 17> “suggested” that the guidelines were “draconian” in light of “peer to peer programs” 
<line: 18> for exchanging child pornography  (Doc. # 34, at 1–2 (citing Doc. # 13-9, at 48, 54 
<line: 19> (Ballard’s Opening Appellate Br.)).)  Contrary to Mr. Ballard’s argument, these 
<line: 20> references on appeal to the § 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) enhancement show that he did not 
<line: 21> challenge the five-level enhancement “to the fullest extent,” Outler, 485 F.3d 
<line: 22> at 1282, if at all, and render dubious his due diligence in pursuing his claim.  Mr. 
<line: 23> Ballard has not met his burden of proving that he is entitled to the “extraordinary 
<line: 24> remedy” of equitable tolling.  Id. at 1280.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> Third, the Recommendation concludes that, even if Mr. Ballard’s claim is not 
<line: 5> barred by the statute of limitations, it fails on the merits.  This conclusion is sound.  
<line: 6> Mr. Ballard fails to show any alleged error that amounts to a “complete miscarriage 
<line: 7> of justice.”  Burke v. United States, 152 F.3d 1329, 1331 (11th Cir. 1998).  The 
<line: 8> sentencing record belies Mr. Ballard’s arguments that the § 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) 
<line: 9> enhancement was wrongly applied based solely on his file-sharing software’s default 
<line: 10> setting that automatically saves downloaded images into a shared folder or based on 
<line: 11> evidence short of proof that Mr. Ballard distributed child pornography for the 
<line: 12> specific purpose of receiving child pornography in return.  See Ballard, 3:09cr149 
<line: 13> (Sentencing Tr., at 9–14 (Doc. # 155).)  Furthermore, this court confirms what the 
<line: 14> Recommendation hinted, namely, that the sentencing court would have applied the 
<line: 15> § 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) enhancement even if Amendment 801 had been in effect on the 
<line: 16> date of Mr. Ballard’s sentencing.  (Doc. # 33, at 10.)   

[TEXT]
<line: 18> In sum, the Recommendation properly rejects Mr. Ballard’s § 2255 motion as 
<line: 19> untimely and on the merits.  Mr. Ballard’s objections, therefore, are due to be 
<line: 20> overruled. 

[TITLE]
<line: 22> III.  CONCLUSION 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Mr. Ballard’s § 2255 motion is time-barred under § 2255(f)(1) and is not saved 
<line: 25> by equitable tolling.  Alternatively, Mr. Ballard’s § 2255 motion fails on the merits.  
<line: 26> Accordingly, it is ORDERED as follows:

<line: 5> Mr. Ballard’s objections (Doc. # 34) are OVERRULED; 
<line: 6> (2) 
<line: 7> The Recommendation (Doc. # 33) is ADOPTED;

<line: 9> Mr. Ballard’s § 2255 motion (Doc. # 1) is DENIED; and

<line: 11> This action is DISMISSED with prejudice. 

[TEXT]
<line: 13> It is further ORDERED that a certificate of appealability is DENIED.  
<line: 14> Reasonable jurists would not debate that Mr. Ballard’s § 2255 motion was time-
<line: 15> barred under § 2255(f)(1) or whether Mr. Ballard was entitled to equitable tolling of 
<line: 16> § 2255(f)(1)’s limitations period.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2); Slack v. McDaniel, 
<line: 17> 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).  Reasonable jurists also would not debate whether on the 
<line: 18> merits “the petition should have been resolved in a different manner.”  Slack, 529
