[TITLE]
<line: 29> ORDER

[TEXT]
<line: 31> Each of the captioned cases is a B-3 medical case arising out of the Deepwater
<line: 32> Horizon oil spill. In each case, the Court excluded the plaintiff's general causation
<line: 33> expert and granted BP's motion for summary judgment. Before the Court now are
<line: 34> identical Motions for Reconsideration filed by Plaintiffs and identical oppositions to
<line: 35> each filed by Defendants. Having considered the motions and legal memoranda, the
<line: 36> record, and the applicable law, the Court finds that the motions should be denied

<line: 38> Motions to reconsider or amend a final or partial judgment are "not the proper

<line: 4> vehicle for rehashing evidence, legal theories, or arguments that could have been offered 
<line: 5> or raised before entry of judgment.” Templet v. HydroChem Inc., 367 F.3d 473, 478–79 
<line: 6> (5th Cir. 2004); Southern Snow Manufacturing Co, Inc. v. Snowizard Holdings, Inc., 921 
<line: 7> F. Supp. 2d 548, 565 (E.D. La. 2013). Also, such motions should not be used to “re-litigate 
<line: 8> prior matters that . . . simply have been resolved to the movant’s dissatisfaction.” See 
<line: 9> Voisin v. Tetra Techs., Inc., No. 08-1302, 2010 WL 3943522, at *2 (E.D. La. Oct. 6, 2010). 
<line: 10> Thus, to prevail on a motion under Rule 59(e), the movant must clearly establish at least 
<line: 11> one of four factors: (1) the motion is necessary to correct a manifest error of law, (2) the 
<line: 12> movant presents newly discovered or previously unavailable evidence, (3) the motion is 
<line: 13> necessary in order to prevent manifest injustice, or (4) the motion is justified by an 
<line: 14> intervening change in controlling law. Snowizard, 921 F. Supp. 2d at 565; Schiller v. 
<line: 15> Physicians Res. Grp. Inc., 342 F.3d 563, 567 (5th Cir. 2003); Ross v. Marshall, 426 F.3d 
<line: 16> 745, 763 (5th Cir. 2005). 

[TEXT]
<line: 18> In these B-3 cases, Plaintiffs simply rehash arguments previously made, and do 
<line: 19> not raise anything new that could not have been offered before entry of judgment. As 
<line: 20> Defendants correctly point out, the ongoing discovery dispute in a different B3 case 
<line: 21> regarding BP’s Rule 30(b)(6) witness is irrelevant to either the Motions in Limine to 
<line: 22> Exclude Dr. Jerald Cook or the Motions for Summary Judgment. Moreover, this Court 
<line: 23> is not alone in this conclusion, which is joined by at least five other judges of this Court. 

[TEXT]
<line: 25> As the Court previously stated, even assuming that BP had an affirmative duty 
<line: 26> to conduct dermal testing or biomonitoring after the oil spill, the lack of this information 
<line: 27> is not what renders Dr. Cook’s expert report unreliable, unhelpful, and inadmissible.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> The general causation inquiry in toxic tort cases is not limited to environmental 
<line: 5> sampling data taken as part of the incident at issue. Instead, an expert may consult all 
<line: 6> relevant scientific and medical literature on the harmful effects of the chemicals at issue 
<line: 7> to determine whether a relevant chemical has the capacity to cause the harm alleged by 
<line: 8> the plaintiff in the general population. Dr. Cook’s expert report failed to identify a single 
<line: 9> chemical which could cause the particular medical injuries alleged by each Plaintiff.  

[TEXT]
<line: 11> Accordingly, 

[TEXT]
<line: 13> IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Motions for Reconsideration are 
<line: 14> DENIED.
