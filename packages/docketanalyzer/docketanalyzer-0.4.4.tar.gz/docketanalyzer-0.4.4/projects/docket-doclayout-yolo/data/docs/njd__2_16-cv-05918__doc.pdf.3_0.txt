[TEXT]
<line: 24> THE PLAINTIFFS bring this action to recover damages linked to the.
<line: 25> repossession of an automobile that contained personal items. The plaintiffs name the
<line: 26> bank repossessing the automobile, the bank's service agent, and  of note here - the.
<line: 27> police department and its chief for the municipality where the automobile was located.
<line: 28> when it was repossessed. The plaintiffs assert that the police department and its chief.
<line: 29> violated their constitutional rights by allowing, and then failing to investigate, the seizure
<line: 30> of the automobile and the personal possessions in that automobile. See 28 U.S.C. Sec..
<line: 31> 1983; see also 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1331. In conjunction with the complaint, the plaintiffs
<line: 32> move for a temporary restraining order for the return of the automobile and the property.
<line: 33> within.

[TEXT]
<line: 35> THE gravamen of the complaint is actually a dispute between the plaintiffs and a

<line: 4> claim under Section 1983 that essentially seeks relief due to the conduct of private actors,
<line: 5> no matter how wrongful the conduct. See Dophin v. Bank of America Mortgage Co., 641
<line: 6> Fed.Appx. 131 (3d Cir. 2016); St. Croix v. Etenad, 183 Fed.Appx. 230 (3d Cir. 2006).

<line: 8> FURTHERMORE, to the extent that the plaintiffs assert that the police
<line: 9> department and the chief failed to investigate the circumstances of the repossession, they
<line: 10> have no cause of action. They are private citizens with no federal right to compel an
<line: 11> investigation, because initiating an investigation is a function of governmental discretion.
<line: 12> See Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973)

[TEXT]
<line: 14> THUs, the Court is without subject matter jurisdiction here. The Court will (1)
<line: 15> deny the motion for a temporary restraining order, and (2) dismiss the complaint without
<line: 16> prejudice to the plaintiffs to seek relief in the appropriate state court. The Court notes
<line: 17> that, in any event, there is no irreparable harm here that would mandate the entry of a
<line: 18> temporary restraining order, as any potential damages can be redressed through a
<line: 19> monetary award.

[TEXT]
<line: 21> THE COURT will enter an appropriate order and judgment.
