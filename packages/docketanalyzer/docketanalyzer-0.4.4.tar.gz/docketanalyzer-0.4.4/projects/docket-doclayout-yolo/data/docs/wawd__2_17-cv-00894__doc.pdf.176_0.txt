<line: 45> The following Minute Order is made by direction of the Court, the Honorable
<line: 46> Thomas S. Zilly, United States District Judge:.

[TEXT]
<line: 48> (1)
<line: 49> Plaintiff's motion for attorney fees, docket no. 154, is DENIED. Plaintiff's
<line: 50> request is brought under the Lanham Act, which authorizes the Court to award reasonable
<line: 51> attorney fees to the prevailing party in an "exceptional' case. 15 U.S.C. s 1117(a)..
<line: 52> Plaintiff bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that this case is
<line: 53> "exceptional"' within the meaning of the Lanham Act. See SunEarth, Inc. v. Sun Earth.
<line: 54> Solar Power Co., 839 F.3d 1179, 1181 (9th Cir. 2016) (en banc). An "exceptional"' case
<line: 55> is one that "stands out from others'' with respect to either the "substantive strength of a
<line: 56> party's litigating position' or the "unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.'
<line: 57> Id. at 1180 (quoting Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 572 U.S. 545,
<line: 58> 554 (2014)). The Supreme Court has not adopted any "precise rule or formula for
<line: 59> making these determinations," and has instructed that "equitable discretion"' should be
<line: 60> exercised "in light of the considerations [it has] identified." Octane Fitness, 572 U.S. at
<line: 61> 554. Those considerations, which must be viewed in the "totality of the circumstances,
<line: 62> include the following, nonexclusive factors: frivolousness, motivation, objective
<line: 63> unreasonableness in the factual and/or legal components of the case, and the need to
<line: 64> advance considerations of compensation and deterrence. SunEarth, 839 F.3d at 1180-81.
<line: 65> Given the relative weakness of plaintiff's marks, plaintiff's abandonment after trial began

<line: 22> of its claim for actual damages, plaintiff's lack of success with respect to the two largest
<line: 23> components of damages that it sought (i.e., the disgorgement of defendants' profits
<line: 24> associated with ECO FILL 2.0 and ECO CARAFE), and the fairly narrow injunctive
<line: 25> relief awarded to plaintiff, the Court cannot find that plaintiff's claims stand out from
<line: 26> others as exceptionally strong. The Court also cannot conclude that defendants litigated
<line: 27> this matter in a manner that was unreasonable. If anything, this case stands out for the
<line: 28> cordiality that trial counsel displayed toward each other and for the absence of any
<line: 29> discovery motion. Moreover, on the first day of trial, plaintiff, not defendants, was the
<line: 30> subject of a Minute Order, docket no. 119, requiring a showing of cause why it should
<line: 31> not be sanctioned for failing to make certain mandatory disclosures, and in response,
<line: 32> plaintiff withdrew its claim for actual damages, see Pla.'s Resp. (docket no. 120)
<line: 33> Notably, in its motion for attorney fees, plaintiff does not contend that its position in this
<line: 34> case was particularly strong or that defendants' litigation behavior was unreasonable in
<line: 35> any regard. Rather, in seeking attorney fees, plaintiff relies primarily on the fact that
<line: 36> defendants' infringement was deemed willful. Although willfulness can be a
<line: 37> compelling' indicator that a case is exceptional, such conclusion is not automatic. See
<line: 38> Microsoft Corp. v. Corel Corp., 2018 WL 2183268 at *8-*9 (N.D. Cal. May 11, 2018)
<line: 39> (concluding that willful patent infringement was "not sufficient to render this an
<line: 40> exceptional case" and that "[slomething more is needed"); see also SunEarth, 839 F.3d at.
<line: 41> 1180 (the fee-shifting provisions of the Patent Act and the Lanham Act are interpreted "in.
<line: 42> tandem''). In this matter, the Court found that, when defendants adopted their ECO FILL
<line: 43> mark in 2012, they were aware of plaintiff's EKOBREW marks, which were associated
<line: 44>  with award-winning products, and that defendants chose the ECO FILL mark and
<line: 45> designed their logo in an effort to exploit plaintiff's success. See Findings of Fact and
<line: 46> Conclusions of Law at 9 18 & 33-41 (docket no. 149). These findings support the
<line: 47> conclusion that defendants' infringement was willful, see id. at J 32 & 42, but the
<line: 48> context in which such willful infringement occurred weighs against finding this case
<line: 49> exceptional. When defendants first began using ECO FILL, and when they extended the
<line: 50> "ECO' line of marks to include ECO CARAFE and ECO-FLOW, plaintiff had not yet
<line: 51> registered its EKOBREW marks. Indeed, the bulk of defendants' profits associated with
<line: 52> the "ECO" line of marks was generated before the Certificates of Registration for
<line: 53> EKOBREW and the ekobrew design were issued in November 2016. See id. at J[ 3; see
<line: 54> also Minute Order at 3 n.1 & Table 3 (docket no. 174). In seeking attorney fees, plaintiff
<line: 55> also argues that defendants' adoption of additional infringing marks (i.e., ECO-PURE,
<line: 56> ECO FILTER, and ECOSAVE) while this action was pending and defendants' proffer of
<line: 57> non-credible testimony at trial in both this matter and the prior patent litigation establish a
<line: 58> need for deterrence that renders this case exceptional. The Court is not convinced. The
<line: 59> jury in the earlier proceedings found that defendants' patent infringement was not willful,
<line: 60> the presiding judge refused plaintiff's invitation to disturb the jury's verdict and declined
<line: 61> plaintiff's request to find the case "exceptional' in its entirety, and the Federal Circuit
<line: 62> affirmed the judgment. See Eko Brands, LLC v. Adrian Rivera Maynez Enterprises, Inc.,.
<line: 63> W.D. Wash. Case No. C15-522 JPD (docket nos. 242, 271, & 341). The result in the
<line: 64> patent infringement matter, which reflects that the jury "credited" Adrian Rivera's

<line: 21> testimony, see Order at 8 (C15-522 JPD, docket no. 271), does not support a conclusion
<line: 22> that defendants are serial liars or that this case stands out from others in which the parties
<line: 23> disagree about the underlying facts and the inferences to be drawn. The previous
<line: 24> litigation also undermines plaintiff's accusation that defendants "adopted additional
<line: 25> marks calculated to build on [their] ill-gotten gain,"' Pla.'s Mot. at 5 (docket no. 154),
<line: 26> because plaintiff had the opportunity, before defendants further expanded their "ECO"
<line: 27> line of marks, to pursue its trademark infringement claims in the earlier case, but opted
<line: 28> not to do so. Indeed, in presenting their laches defense, which was rendered moot by the
<line: 29> finding of willfulness, defendants pointed to plaintiff's failure to raise the trademark
<line: 30> infringement claim in the prior patent-related litigation. See Defs.' Trial Brief at 18
<line: 31> (docket no. 96). Given the status of plaintiff's marks between 2012 and 2016, and the
<line: 32> course of the parties' patent dispute, the Court concludes that plaintiff has been.
<line: 33> adequately compensated by the disgorgement of net profits attributable to the use of
<line: 34> certain "ECO" marks, and that the permanent injunction entered by the Court will serve
<line: 35> to deter defendants from further infringing on plaintiff's EKOBREW marks. Attorney
<line: 36> fees would be unnecessarily punitive, and based on the "totality of the circumstances,'
<line: 37> the Court, exercising its "significant [equitable] discretion," finds that this case is not
<line: 38> "exceptional"' within the meaning of the Lanham Act. See SunEarth, Inc. v. Sun Earth
<line: 39> Solar Power Co., 2017 WL 9471951 at *1 (N.D. Cal. July 19, 2017) (denying motion to
<line: 40> amend Order on Attorneys' Fees After Remand (Feb. 22, 2017) (ruling that the Lanham
<line: 41> Act case was not exceptional because the non-prevailing defendants' litigating position
<line: 42> was "not objectively unreasonable," their two "major missteps" in the action were not the
<line: 43> product of "wrongful' motives, and the plaintiffs had been separately compensated by an
<line: 44> award of attorneys' fees and costs incurred in bringing their motion for contempt))
