[TITLE]
<line: 17> FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 

[TEXT]
<line: 19> 14. 
<line: 20> Plaintiff incurred an alleged debt for goods and services used for personal, family 
<line: 21> or household purposes, originally for a defaulted HSBC Bank Nevada (“HSBC”) consumer 
<line: 22> credit card account (“alleged debt”). The alleged debt is thus a “debt” as that term is defined at § 
<line: 23> 1692a(5) of the FDCPA. 

[TEXT]
<line: 25> 15. 
<line: 26> Due to his financial circumstances, Plaintiff could not pay the alleged debt, and it 
<line: 27> went into default. 

[TEXT]
<line: 29> 16. 
<line: 30> HSBC subsequently charged off the account. 

[TEXT]
<line: 32> 17. 
<line: 33> Cavalry purchased the alleged debt sometime thereafter. 

[TEXT]
<line: 35> 18. 
<line: 36> Cavalry assigned the debt to CPS for collection. 

[TEXT]
<line: 38> 19. 
<line: 39> In May, 2012, CPS communicated, inter alia, an account balance, an account 
<line: 40> number and an original creditor to the Experian consumer reporting agency. (Exhibit E, Excerpt 
<line: 41> of Plaintiff’s Experian credit report). 

[TEXT]
<line: 43> 20. 
<line: 44> Credit reporting by a debt collector constitutes an attempt to collect a debt. See 
<line: 45> e.g., Rivera v. Bank One, 145 F.R.D. 614, 623 (D.P.R. 1993) (a creditor’s report of a debt to a

[TEXT]
<line: 4> consumer reporting agency is a “powerful tool, designed in part to wrench compliance with 
<line: 5> payment terms from its cardholder”). 

[TEXT]
<line: 7> 21. 
<line: 8> CPS communicated an original balance on the alleged debt of $608. (Ex. E, 
<line: 9> Experian). 
<line: 10> 22. 
<line: 11> Plaintiff purchased his Experian credit report. 
<line: 12> 23. 
<line: 13> In May, 2016, CPS communicated a balance of $636 to Experian.  
<line: 14> 24. 
<line: 15> In May, 2016, Cavalry attempted to collect an additional $28 on the alleged debt, 
<line: 16> over and above the original amount of $608.  

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 25. 
<line: 19> Cavalry had no statutory or contractual right to collect additional amounts on the 
<line: 20> alleged debt, as it had no right to assess interest or other charges on the alleged debt. 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 26. 
<line: 23> Despite the fact that Cavalry had no right to charge interest or other charges on 
<line: 24> the alleged debt, CPS reported an inflated balance to Experian. 

[TEXT]
<line: 26> 27. 
<line: 27> 15 U.S.C. § 1692e of the FDCPA provides as follows: 

[TITLE]
<line: 29> False or misleading representations 

[TEXT]
<line: 31> A debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading 
<line: 32> representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt. 

[TEXT]
<line: 34> Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the 
<line: 35> following conduct is a violation of this section:  

[TEXT]
<line: 37> . . . (2) The false representation of— 

[TEXT]
<line: 39> (A) the character, amount, or legal status of any debt. . . 

[TEXT]
<line: 41> . . . (8) Communicating or threatening to communicate to any person 
<line: 42> credit information which is known or which should be known to be 
<line: 43> false, including the failure to communicate that a disputed debt is 
<line: 44> disputed. . . .

<line: 5> Defendants misrepresented the amount of the alleged debt, in violation of 15 
<line: 6> U.S.C. §§ 1692e, 1692e(2)(A) and 1692e(8) when they communicated to Experian a balance 
<line: 7> including unlawful interest, which it knew or should have known to be false. 

[TEXT]
<line: 9> 29. 
<line: 10> 15 U.S.C. § 1692f of the FDCPA provides as follows: 

[TITLE]
<line: 12> Unfair practices 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> A debt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to 
<line: 15> collect or attempt to collect any debt. Without limiting the general 
<line: 16> application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this 
<line: 17> section: 

[TEXT]
<line: 19> . . . (1) The collection of any amount (including any interest, fee, 
<line: 20> charge, or expense incidental to the principal obligation) unless such 
<line: 21> amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or 
<line: 22> permitted by law. . . . 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> 30. 
<line: 25> Defendants attempted to collect an amount not authorized by the agreement 
<line: 26> creating the debt or permitted by law when they attempted to collect an additional $28 in interest 
<line: 27> and fees from Plaintiff, in violation of 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692f and 1692f(1). 

[TEXT]
<line: 29> 31. 
<line: 30> 225 ILCS 425/9 of the ICAA prohibits the following: 

[TEXT]
<line: 32> . . . (33) Collecting or attempting to collect any interest or other 
<line: 33> charge or fee in excess of the actual debt unless such interest or other 
<line: 34> charge or fee is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the 
<line: 35> debt unless expressly authorized by law or unless in a commercial 
<line: 36> transaction such interest or other charge or fee is expressly authorized 
<line: 37> in a subsequent agreement. . . . 

[TEXT]
<line: 39> 32. 
<line: 40> Defendants attempted to collect interest or other charges in excess of the actual 
<line: 41> debt when no such charges were authorized by the agreement creating the debt or by law, in 
<line: 42> violation of 225 ILCS 425/9(33) of the ICAA. 

[TEXT]
<line: 44> 33. 
<line: 45> A private right of action exists for violation of the ICAA. Sherman v. Field Clinic, 
<line: 46> 74 Ill. App. 3d 21, 392 N.E.2d 154 (1st Dist. 1979).

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 34. 
<line: 5> In fact, statutes providing for administrative remedies (e.g. the revocation of a 
<line: 6> license, etc.) imply civil rights of action in Illinois. Trull v. GC Servs. Ltd. P'ship, 961 F. Supp. 
<line: 7> 1199, 1206 (N.D. Ill. 1997). 

[TEXT]
<line: 9> 35. 
<line: 10> Cavalry authorized, directed, and ratified every action taken by CPS on its behalf, 
<line: 11> and is liable for the acts and omissions of CPS, committed in connection with efforts to collect 
<line: 12> the alleged debt from Plaintiff.  See Fox v. Citicorp Credit Services, Inc., 15 F.3d 1507 (9th Cir. 
<line: 13> 1994); Pollice v. National Tax Funding, L.P., 225 F.3d 379 (3rd Cir. 2000). 

[TEXT]
<line: 15> 36. 
<line: 16> Defendants’ collection communications are to be interpreted under the 
<line: 17> “unsophisticated consumer” standard. See, Gammon v. GC Services, Ltd. Partnership, 27 F.3d 
<line: 18> 1254, 1257 (7th Cir. 1994).
