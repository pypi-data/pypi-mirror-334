[TITLE]
<line: 29> MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

[TEXT]
<line: 31> After a dispute at a wedding reception, plaintiffs Andrew Terrell (“Andrew”), the groom,
<line: 32> and George Terrell (“George”), the groom’s brother, filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County a
<line: 33> suit against defendants Peter Diangi (“Diangi”), Silver Lake Country Club, Inc. (the “Club”) and
<line: 34> the Village of Orland Park (“Orland Park”).  Defendants removed the case to this court, because
<line: 35> plaintiffs assert claims arising under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  In their first amended complaint,
<line: 36> plaintiffs assert 22 counts against defendants.  In Counts XI and XXII, Andrew Terrell and
<line: 37> George Terrell, respectively, seek to hold defendants Diangi and Orland Park liable under 42
<line: 38> U.S.C. § 1983.  

[TEXT]
<line: 40> Before the Court are: (1) defendant Diangi’s motion for summary judgment on the § 1983
<line: 41> claims; and (2) Diangi’s motions to strike.  For the reasons set out below, the Court grants the
<line: 42> motion for summary judgment and denies the motions to strike.

[TITLE]
<line: 2> I.
<line: 3> Background

[TITLE]
<line: 5> A. 
<line: 6> Motions to strike and evidentiary objections

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Local Rule 56.1 outlines the requirements for the introduction of facts parties would like
<line: 9> considered in connection with a motion for summary judgment.  As the Court notes on its
<line: 10> website (and has mentioned in multiple opinions), the Court enforces Local Rule 56.1 strictly.
<line: 11> Facts that are argued but do not conform with the rule are not considered by the Court.  For
<line: 12> example, facts included in a party’s brief but not in its statement of facts are not considered by
<line: 13> the Court because to do so would rob the other party of the opportunity to show that such facts
<line: 14> are disputed.  Where one party supports a fact with admissible evidence and the other party fails
<line: 15> to controvert the fact with citation to admissible evidence, the Court deems the fact admitted. 
<line: 16> See Ammons v. Aramark Uniform Services, Inc., 368 F.3d 809, 817-818 (7th Cir. 2004).  Thus,
<line: 17> for example, the Court deems admitted Diangi’s fact ¶¶ 39, 40, 45 and 47.  It is not enough at the
<line: 18> summary judgment stage for either party to say a fact is disputed.  The Court considers a fact
<line: 19> disputed only if both parties put forth admissible evidence of his or its version of the fact. 
<line: 20> Asserted “facts” not supported by deposition testimony, documents, affidavits or other evidence
<line: 21> admissible for summary judgment purposes are not considered by the Court.  The Court enforces
<line: 22> Local Rule 56.1 with respect to all parties regardless of whether either party moves to strike non-
<line: 23> complying portions, because the purpose of the rule is to make the Court’s job manageable, not
<line: 24> to give litigants additional ammunition to use against one another.

[TEXT]
<line: 26> Diangi has filed two motions to strike.  Diangi wants to strike plaintiffs’ response to
<line: 27> Diangi’s statement of undisputed facts and plaintiffs’ statement of undisputed facts.  This the
<line: 28> Court will not do.  The Court need not take the time to strike that which it can simply ignore. 
<line: 29> Plaintiffs’ motions to strike are denied.  The Court will, however, rule on the evidentiary
<line: 30> objections contained within the motions to strike.

[ABANDON]
<line: 32> -2-

[TEXT]
<line: 2> First, Diangi object to portions of Andrew Terrell’s affidavit on the grounds that some of
<line: 3> the statements contained therein lack foundation.  The Federal Rules of Evidence require
<line: 4> foundation for testimony.  Rule 602 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that a “witness
<line: 5> may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the
<line: 6> witness has personal knowledge of the matter.”  See Fed. R. Evid. 602.  Thus, in an affidavit, a
<line: 7> statement that a witness knows something, without statements about how the witness knows that
<line: 8> something, is not admissible.  See Ward v. First Federal Savings Bank, 173 F.3d 611, 618 (7th
<line: 9> Cir. 1999); Drake v. 3M, 134 F.3d 878, 887 (7th Cir. 1998).  The Court has ignored the portions
<line: 10> of Andrew Terrell’s affidavit that lack foundation.

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Next, Diangi objects to the admissibility of several documents plaintiffs submitted. 
<line: 13> Specifically, plaintiffs supported some of their factual assertions with written statements
<line: 14> witnesses provided to the police.  As Diangi points out, these documents are offered to prove the
<line: 15> truth of the matter asserted and are hearsay.  Plaintiffs do not include an affidavit authenticating
<line: 16> the documents and establishing how they come within an exception (such as the business record
<line: 17> exception) to the hearsay rule.  Accordingly, the Court sustains Diangi’s objections as to the
<line: 18> admissibility of exhibits 2, 3, 4 and 5.  See Woods v. City of Chi, 234 F.3d 979, 988 (7th Cir.
<line: 19> 2001) (“Normally, . . . at the summary judgment stage, a party seeking to offer the business
<line: 20> record must attach an affidavit sworn to by a person who would be qualified to introduce the
<line: 21> record as evidence at trial.”). 

[TEXT]
<line: 23> Finally, Diangi objects to an exhibit proffered by plaintiffs.  The heading on the exhibit is
<line: 24> “ORLAND PARK POLICE DEPARTMENT GENERAL ORDER” and the subject is, “OFF
<line: 25> DUTY AND EXTRA DUTY EMPLOYMENT.”  Diangi objects to the exhibit on the grounds
<line: 26> that it was not produced by plaintiffs in discovery.  Plaintiffs concede that they failed to produce
<line: 27> the document in discovery.  Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure says, “[i]f a party

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> -3-

[TEXT]
<line: 2> fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not
<line: 3> allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a
<line: 4> trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.”  Plaintiffs argue that their
<line: 5> failure to produce the document is harmless because it must have been in the custody of
<line: 6> defendant Orland Park and defendant Diangi worked for Orland Park.  Even if the failure were
<line: 7> harmless as to Orland Park, the Court does not think the failure is harmless as to Diangi. 
<line: 8> Plaintiffs have not shown that Diangi actually had the document before plaintiffs attempted to
<line: 9> use it as evidence.  Diangi, thus, had no opportunity during discovery to determine the
<line: 10> authenticity or admissibility of the document.  Accordingly, the Court will not consider the
<line: 11> document with respect to this motion for summary judgment.  

[TITLE]
<line: 13> B. 
<line: 14> Facts relevant to the motion

[TEXT]
<line: 16> The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted.  

[TEXT]
<line: 18> In March 2006, Andrew Terrell and Melissa Schultz (“Melissa”) were married.  They
<line: 19> held their wedding reception at the Silver Lake Country Club.  Although Andrew Terrell and
<line: 20> Melissa Schultz had several members of their families (including Andrew’s brother George,
<line: 21> Andrew’s cousin Jason Terrell (“Jason”) and Melissa Schultz’s mother Pamela Schultz
<line: 22> (“Pamela”)) in attendance at their reception, not every part of the occasion was joyous.

[TEXT]
<line: 24> The Club hired a security guard for the reception, as it did for other events.  On the
<line: 25> evening of Andrew and Melissa’s wedding reception, defendant Diangi was working as the
<line: 26> security guard at the Club.  Diangi had worked part-time as a security guard at the Club since
<line: 27> 2003.  Working as a security guard at the Club was not Diangi’s full-time job.  

[TEXT]
<line: 29> Diangi’s full-time job was as a police officer for the Village of Orland Park.  In fact, it
<line: 30> was a fellow police officer at Orland Park who told Diangi about the security guard position at

[ABANDON]
<line: 32> -4-

[TEXT]
<line: 2> the Club.  Before he could accept the job at the Club, Diangi had to get permission from his
<line: 3> police chief.

[TEXT]
<line: 5> When Diangi arrived at the Club on the evening of Andrew and Melissa’s wedding
<line: 6> reception, Diangi punched in and checked in with the bartender.  Diangi was wearing black pants
<line: 7> and a sport coat.  Diangi was not wearing his police uniform or any other insignia that would
<line: 8> identify him as a police officer.  Diangi’s duties as a security guard at the Club were to secure
<line: 9> the property by checking all areas of the Club’s interior, handle problems as they arose, prevent
<line: 10> fights and check for illegal drug use and underaged drinking. 

[TEXT]
<line: 12> At some point during the reception, a waitress alerted Diangi to the possibility of
<line: 13> underaged drinking at a particular table.  Diangi observed what he thought was underaged
<line: 14> drinking by two individuals.  Without identifying himself as a police officer, Diangi asked the
<line: 15> two for identification and informed them that they could not drink unless they were 21 years of
<line: 16> age.  Next, Diangi told the bartender not to serve alcohol to the two underaged individuals.

[TEXT]
<line: 18> Soon, Diangi saw Jason Terrell provide the two underaged individuals with alcoholic
<line: 19> beverages.  Diangi approached the two underaged individuals, took their drinks and returned the
<line: 20> drinks to the bar.  Diangi then went to look for Jason Terrell.

[TEXT]
<line: 22> While Diangi was looking for Jason, the bartender told Diangi that men were urinating in
<line: 23> the women’s bathroom.  Diangi headed for the women’s bathroom and saw Jason stumble out of
<line: 24> the women’s bathroom.  Diangi walked toward Jason and told him he worked for the Club. 
<line: 25> Diangi did not identify himself as a police officer.  Diangi grasped Jason by the elbow and told
<line: 26> Jason he needed to speak to him.  Jason pushed Diangi.  Diangi, who still did not identify
<line: 27> himself as a police officer, told Jason he needed to speak with him at some other location
<line: 28> because it was loud where they were.  Jason again pushed Diangi, who fell back against a wall.

[ABANDON]
<line: 30> -5-

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Facts about the remainder of the evening are sparse, because no party supported all of his
<line: 3> version of the facts with admissible evidence.  At some point, George Terrell saw Diangi and
<line: 4> Jason’s interaction and attempted to break it up.  At some point, Diangi released pepper spray. 
<line: 5> At some point, on-duty Orland Park police officers arrived and arrested George and Jason
<line: 6> Terrell.  Andrew Terrell was arrested later when he turned himself in.

[TEXT]
<line: 8> There is one disputed fact (i.e., a fact on which each side put forth admissible evidence
<line: 9> and on which the admissible evidence conflicts).  Diangi says that after Jason threw him against
<line: 10> a wall, Diangi identified himself as a police officer.  Plaintiffs put forth admissible evidence that
<line: 11> Diangi never identified himself as a police officer.

[TEXT]
<line: 13> The Club paid Diangi for his work at the wedding reception.  After the reception, Diangi
<line: 14> filed a workers’ compensation claim against the Club for the injuries he sustained at the wedding
<line: 15> reception.

[TEXT]
<line: 17> Defendant Diangi has moved for summary judgment on plaintiffs’ § 1983 claims.

[TITLE]
<line: 19> II.
<line: 20> Summary Judgment Standard

[TEXT]
<line: 22> Summary judgment should be granted when “the pleadings, depositions, answers to
<line: 23> interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, show that there is no
<line: 24> genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter
<line: 25> of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  When making such a determination, the Court must construe the
<line: 26> evidence and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.  See Anderson v.
<line: 27> Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986).  Summary judgment is appropriate, however,
<line: 28> when the non-moving party “fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an
<line: 29> element essential to the party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at
<line: 30> trial.”  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).  “A genuine issue of material fact
<line: 31> arises only if sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party exists to permit a jury to return a

[ABANDON]
<line: 33> -6-

[TEXT]
<line: 2> verdict for that party.”  Brummett v. Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc., 414 F.3d 686, 692 (7th Cir.
<line: 3> 2005).

[TITLE]
<line: 5> III.
<line: 6> Discussion

[TEXT]
<line: 8> In Counts XI and XXII, respectively, plaintiffs Andrew Terrell and George Terrell pursue
<line: 9> their private right of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and assert that Diangi interfered with their
<line: 10> constitutional rights at the wedding reception.  That statute states, in relevant part, “[e]very
<line: 11> person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any State . . .
<line: 12> subjects . . . any citizen of the United States . . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or
<line: 13> immunities secured by the Constitution . . . shall be liable to the party injured in an action at
<line: 14> law.”  42 U.S.C. § 1983 (emphasis added).  Diangi moves for summary judgment on the claims
<line: 15> on the ground that he was not acting under color of law at the wedding reception.

[TEXT]
<line: 17> Diangi’s “mere status as a policeman does not render all of his acts under color of state
<line: 18> law.”  Gibson v. City of Chi., 910 F.2d 1510, 1516 (7th Cir. 1990).  Still, a police officer may act
<line: 19> under color of law even if he is off-duty.  United States v. Christian, 342 F.3d 744, 751 (7th Cir.
<line: 20> 2003).  “Deciding whether a police officer acted under color of state law should turn largely on
<line: 21> the nature of the specific acts the police officer performed, rather than on merely whether he was
<line: 22> actively assigned at the moment to the performance of police duties.”  Pickrel v. City of
<line: 23> Springfield, 45 F.3d 1115, 1118 (7th Cir. 1995).  “To convert off-duty status to one where the
<line: 24> officer was acting under color of law, the off-duty officer must purport to exercise police
<line: 25> authority in some manner, such as flashing a badge, identifying himself as a police officer,
<line: 26> placing an individual under arrest, or performing a duty imposed by police department
<line: 27> regulations.”  Mendez v. Village of Tinley Park, Case No. 07 C 6498, 2008 WL 427791 at *2

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> -7-

[TEXT]
<line: 2> (N.D. Ill. Feb. 14, 2008).  A factor in determining whether an off-duty officer is acting under
<line: 3> color of law is whether he is displaying items of authority, such as a badge or a gun.  See Pickrel,
<line: 4> 45 F.3d at 1118 (concluding that a plaintiff had stated a § 1983 claim against an off-duty police
<line: 5> officer where the plaintiff alleged defendant “was wearing his police uniform and displaying his
<line: 6> badge, both signs of state authority.  He was wearing his gun, enabling him to enforce his
<line: 7> authority.  His marked squad car was parked just outside, advertising the presence of a police
<line: 8> officer to patrons of the restaurant. [Defendant] arrested [plaintiff] and charged her with, among
<line: 9> other things, resisting a peace officer.”); Lyons v. Adams, 257 F. Supp.2d 1125, 1133 (N.D. Ill.
<line: 10> 2003) (concluding that the off-duty officer’s actions were “indistinguishable from those of
<line: 11> private actors” where the off-duty officers did not wear their police uniforms or display their
<line: 12> badges, did not identify themselves as police officers and did not inform plaintiffs that they were
<line: 13> under arrest).

[TEXT]
<line: 15> In this case, the plaintiffs have failed to put forth admissible evidence sufficient to allow
<line: 16> a jury to conclude that Diangi was acting under color of law.  It is undisputed that Diangi was
<line: 17> wearing black pants and a sports jacket, not his police uniform.  Diangi never flashed his badge. 
<line: 18> The tasks Diangi was engaged in that evening are standard duties of security guards.  When the
<line: 19> Club’s waitress informed Diangi about underaged drinking, he informed the underaged drinkers
<line: 20> they could not drink alcohol.  When the Club’s bartender informed Diangi that men were
<line: 21> urinating in the women’s bathroom, Diangi investigated and found Jason Terrell stumbling out
<line: 22> of the women’s bathroom.  Plaintiffs insist Diangi never told them he was a police officer. 
<line: 23> Plaintiffs put forth no evidence that Diangi arrested them.  To the contrary, they put forth
<line: 24> evidence that on-duty officers arrested George and Jason.  Plaintiffs have not put forth evidence

[ABANDON]
<line: 26> -8-

[TEXT]
<line: 2> that would distinguish Diangi’s conduct from the conduct of a private security guard.  It is
<line: 3> undisputed that Diangi told Jason that Diangi worked for the Club.  Finally, it is undisputed that
<line: 4> Diangi was employed by the Club as a security guard and was paid by the Club for his work that
<line: 5> night.  The Court is not aware of any case that stands for the proposition that every off-duty
<line: 6> police officer working as a security guard is necessarily acting under color of law.  

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Plaintiffs have the burden on summary judgment to put forth admissible evidence that
<line: 9> would allow a jury to conclude that Diangi was acting under color of state law.  Summary
<line: 10> judgment is the “put up or shut up” moment of the lawsuit.  Eberts v. Goderstad, 569 F.3d 757, 
<line: 11> 767 (7th Cir. 2009).  Plaintiffs could have submitted affidavits from plaintiff George Terrell and
<line: 12> other witnesses.  If witnesses did not wish to sign affidavits, plaintiffs could have deposed them
<line: 13> and submitted the transcripts.  If they needed more time, plaintiffs could have moved for
<line: 14> additional time.  Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden on summary judgment, and Diangi is
<line: 15> entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Counts XI and XXII against him.

[TEXT]
<line: 17> The Court grants Diangi’s motion for summary judgment and grants him summary
<line: 18> judgment on Counts XI and XXII.
