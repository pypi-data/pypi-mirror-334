[TITLE]
<line: 30> MEMORANDUM OPINION AND DISMISSAL ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 32> This civil action proceeds before the court on Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant 
<line: 33> National Fire & Martine Insurance Company’s (“National Fire”) Motion for Summary 
<line: 34> Judgment 1  (Docs. 18, 19, and 21) and National Fire’s Motion to Strike 
<line: 35> Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff’s Untimely Responses to Requests for Admission & 
<line: 36> Untimely Filed Supplemental Response with Affidavits. (Doc. 36). In lockstep with his 
<line: 37> prosecution of this case, Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff Calvin D. Wells, Jr., 
<line: 38> (“Wells”) tendered an untimely and brief argument and a request for an extension of 
<line: 39> time to respond more fully to the summary judgment motion, followed by even more 
<line: 40> sparse filings that the undersigned will discuss. (Doc. 26).  

[ABANDON]
<line: 42> 1 Plaintiff also requested oral argument in this action, and Defendant opposes the request. However, 
<line: 43> the court can decide the issues presented with the aid of the parties’ written submissions alone, and 
<line: 44> thus, oral argument is unnecessary in this case. Accordingly, to the extent that it may be construed as a 
<line: 45> motion, the court DENIES the request for oral argument. 1231231

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Based upon the following discussion, the court GRANTS National Fire’s 
<line: 3> Motion to Strike, DENIES Wells’s request for more time to respond to National Fire’s 
<line: 4> Motion for Summary Judgment, GRANTS National Fire’s request for the court to 
<line: 5> strike Wells’s untimely response to National Fire’s Motion for Summary Judgment 
<line: 6> (Doc. 29), and GRANTS National Fire’s Motion for Summary Judgment. 

[TITLE]
<line: 8> BACKGROUND 

[TEXT]
<line: 10> The undersigned sets forth the following facts for the summary judgment 
<line: 11> determination, drawn from the evidence taken in the light most favorable to Wells.2 

[TEXT]
<line: 13> Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff Calvin D. Wells, Jr. d/b/a Wells Poultry 
<line: 14> Farm (“Wells”) owns and operates eleven (11) poultry houses in Cullman County, 
<line: 15> Alabama. Wells purchased the houses from his father, C.D. Wells, in 2007. On or about 
<line: 16> July 6, 2014, Wells purchased a Commercial Lines Policy of Insurance (“Policy”) from 
<line: 17> Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant National Fire & Marine Insurance Company 
<line: 18> (“National Fire”). Defendant timely paid premiums on the Policy, and the Policy 
<line: 19> remained in effect until July 6, 2015.  

[TEXT]
<line: 21> On or about March 3, 2015, Wells filed a claim with National Fire alleging that 
<line: 22> ice and snow from a February 25, 2015, snowstorm damaged his poultry houses. Wells 

[ABANDON]
<line: 24> 2 
<line: 25> 2 In considering a motion for summary judgment, the court views the facts in a light most favorable to 
<line: 26> the non-moving party. However, the court gathers the facts largely from Plaintiff’s motion because 
<line: 27> Wells failed to provide timely responses to support his factual assertions, and unsupported factual 
<line: 28> assertions cannot defeat or establish entitlement to summary judgment. See Ellis v. England, 432 F.3d 
<line: 29> 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 2005); Pace v. Capobianco, 283 F.3d 1275, 1276-78 (11th Cir. 2002).  

[ABANDON]1231231

[TEXT]
<line: 2> stated that the storm’s effects caused the buildings to lean, which purportedly 
<line: 3> constituted a covered casualty loss under his Policy with National Fire. Upon receiving 
<line: 4> Wells’s claim, National Fire retained Rimkus Consulting Group, Inc. (“Rimkus”) to 
<line: 5> inspect Wells’s poultry houses.  

[TEXT]
<line: 7> On March 12, 2015, engineer Kyle E. Parker, P.E. performed the inspection on 
<line: 8> Wells’s property. During his inspection, Parker also interviewed Wells, reviewed 
<line: 9> County Property Appraiser records, reviewed applicable portions of the 1999 Accepted 
<line: 10> Practices for Post-Frame Building Construction, reviewed historical weather data from 
<line: 11> the National Weather Service and Weather Underground at their respective websites, 
<line: 12> and reviewed aerial photographs of the poultry houses dated March 5, 1997. 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> On March 26, 2015, Parker issued his findings in a report for National Fire. 
<line: 15> (Doc. 21-4). His report concluded that: (1) the poultry houses leaned up to 
<line: 16> approximately 1.75 inches in 4 feet; (2) there existed no evidence that the leaning 
<line: 17> condition of the chicken houses occurred recently; (3) he did not determine the degree 
<line: 18> that the weight of snow and ice accumulation on February 26, 2015, exacerbated the 
<line: 19> pre-existing leaning condition of the chicken houses; (4) no evidence indicated that 
<line: 20> wind forces on February 26, 2015, caused or contributed to the leaning condition of the 
<line: 21> chicken houses; (5) the lack of a foundation and inadequate anchoring of the posts into 
<line: 22> the ground contributed to the lean; and (6) there existed prior, wind-related lifting of 
<line: 23> purlins from the roof trusses along the eaves of the poultry houses. (Doc. 21-4 at 14). 

[ABANDON]
<line: 25> 3 1231231

[TEXT]
<line: 2> The Policy specifically excludes damage caused by or resulting from “earth shifting 
<line: 3> including soil conditions which cause settlings, cracking or other disarrangement of 
<line: 4> foundations or other parts of reality.” (Doc. 21-6 at 3). The Policy also excluded damage 
<line: 5> caused by or resulting from wear and tear, deterioration, decay or hidden or latent 
<line: 6> defect or any quality in property that causes it to damage or destroy itself. (Id.)  
<line: 7> Utilizing Mr. Parker’s report, along with its own investigative findings, National Fire 
<line: 8> denied Wells’s claim on May 1, 2015. (Doc. 1-2).  

[TEXT]
<line: 10> As additional bases for the denial, National Fire determined that the poultry 
<line: 11> houses were constructed as of March 5, 1997, as verified by a satellite photo from the 
<line: 12> U.S. Geological Survey. National Fire informed Wells that its policy excludes loss or 
<line: 13> damage caused by, or resulting from, the weight of snow, ice, or sleet for buildings 
<line: 14> whose age exceeds fifteen (15) years.  

[TEXT]
<line: 16> After Wells requested a review of the decision, National Fire reopened the 
<line: 17> investigation on July 15, 2015. On July 22, 2015, Parker revisited Wells’s property to 
<line: 18> inspect the poultry houses. Parker utilized the same resources when inspecting the 
<line: 19> property, and he reached the same conclusions.  

[TEXT]
<line: 21> Pursuant to the Policy’s terms and conditions, National Fire conducted an 
<line: 22> examination under oath of Wells on October 14, 2015. During the examination, Wells 
<line: 23> clarified that his claim only involved five of the poultry houses (“5B houses”) and 
<line: 24> provided documentation of the deed to the houses, the property taxes he filed on the 

[ABANDON]
<line: 26> 4 1231231

[TEXT]
<line: 2> houses, and an estimate from Addison Agri Builders regarding the replacement costs of 
<line: 3> the houses. National Fire requested in the notice scheduling the examination provision 
<line: 4> of any documents regarding the original construction of the poultry houses, as well as 
<line: 5> any repairs, remodeling, additions, or changes to any of the poultry houses, yet Wells 
<line: 6> failed to provide any documentation.  In addition, Wells contested Parker’s analysis 
<line: 7> regarding the installation of the posts.  

[TITLE]
<line: 9> PROCEDURAL HISTORY 

[TEXT]
<line: 11> On March 18, 2016, National Fire filed a complaint for declaratory judgment 
<line: 12> against Wells, requesting that the court find no coverage exists for Wells’s claims under 
<line: 13> the insurance policy. (Doc. 1). On April 14, 2016, Wells filed an Answer and a 
<line: 14> Counterclaim, alleging that National Fire wrongfully denied his claims, and thus, 
<line: 15> breached the insurance contract. (Doc. 5). After the parties convened a Rule 26(f) 
<line: 16> Planning Meeting, they released a report to the court on May 31, 2016. (Doc. 11).  

[TEXT]
<line: 18> The court issued a Rule 16 Scheduling Order on June 8, 2016. (Doc. 12). The 
<line: 19> scheduling order contained crucial deadlines that the parties stipulated, including: 

[TEXT]
<line: 21> • Unless modified by stipulation of the parties, disclosure 
<line: 22> of expert witnesses—including a complete report under 
<line: 23> Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B) from any expert—are due: (1) 
<line: 24> from plaintiff by February 28, 2017, and made available 
<line: 25> for deposition by April 14, 2017; (2) from defendant by 
<line: 26> December 15, 2016, and made available for deposition 
<line: 27> by January 30, 2017. 

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> 5 1231231

[TEXT]
<line: 2> • Unless modified by court order for good cause shown, all 
<line: 3> discovery must be commenced in time to be completed 
<line: 4> by May 31, 2017. 
<line: 5> • All potentially dispositive motions must be filed by June 
<line: 6> 30, 2017. 
<line: 7> • Unless modified by stipulation of the parties, responses 
<line: 8> to Requests for Production and Requests for Admission 
<line: 9> are due 30 days after service. 
<line: 10> • Unless modified by court order for good cause shown, 
<line: 11> supplementation of disclosures and discovery under 
<line: 12> Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(e) are due within 30 days of party 
<line: 13> having obtained knowledge of the discoverable 
<line: 14> information, but not later than 30 days prior to close of 
<line: 15> discovery.  

[TEXT]
<line: 17> (emphasis added).  Furthermore, the parties agreed to exchange initial disclosures, as 
<line: 18> required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1)3, by June 30, 2016, and in its efforts 

[ABANDON]
<line: 20> 3 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1) states, in pertinent part:  

[TEXT]
<line: 22> (a) REQUIRED DISCLOSURES. 

[TEXT]
<line: 24>  (1) Initial Disclosure. 

[TEXT]
<line: 26> (A) In General. Except as exempted by Rule 26(a)(1)(B) or as otherwise stipulated or ordered by 
<line: 27> the court, a party must, without awaiting a discovery request, provide to the other parties: 

[TEXT]
<line: 29> (i) the name and, if known, the address and telephone number of each individual likely to 
<line: 30> have discoverable information—along with the subjects of that information—that the 
<line: 31> disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for 
<line: 32> impeachment; 

[TEXT]
<line: 34> (ii) a copy—or a description by category and location—of all documents, electronically 
<line: 35> stored information, and tangible things that the disclosing party has in its possession, custody, 
<line: 36> or control and may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for 
<line: 37> impeachment; 

[ABANDON]
<line: 39> 6 1231231

[TEXT]
<line: 2> to prosecute its claims and defenses, National Fire served Requests for Production of 
<line: 3> Documents on October 31, 2016. (Doc. 14).  

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Importantly, National Fire served Requests for Admission on April 28, 2017. 

[TEXT]
<line: 7> (Doc. 16). The discovery consisted of the following requests: 

[TEXT]
<line: 9> 1. Admit that damage, if any, to any of the 5B poultry 
<line: 10> houses was not caused by direct physical loss or damage 
<line: 11> occurring during the National Fire & Marine Insurance 
<line: 12> Company policy period of July 6, 2014 through July 6, 
<line: 13> 2015. 
<line: 14> 2. Admit that to the extent there is any damage to any of the 
<line: 15> 5B poultry houses, said damage is a result of wear and 
<line: 16> tear, deterioration, settling, cracking, shrinking, lack of a 
<line: 17> proper foundation or inadequate anchoring. 
<line: 18> 3. Admit that all of the 5B poultry houses were built prior to 
<line: 19> March 5, 1997. 
<line: 20> 4. Admit that Calvin Wells has no evidence any of the 5B 
<line: 21> poultry houses were built after March 5, 1997. 
<line: 22> 5. Admit that there was snow in the area of the 5B poultry 
<line: 23> houses on February 25, 2015. 
<line: 24> 6. Admit that Calvin Wells has no evidence to rebut the fact 
<line: 25> that all of the 5B poultry houses were in existence and 
<line: 26> referenced in the property appraisal performed by Ray 
<line: 27> Brannum on November 3, 2000, referenced in the Initial 
<line: 28> Disclosures served by National Fire & Marine Insurance 
<line: 29> Company in this case. 

[ABANDON]
<line: 31> 7 1231231

[TEXT]
<line: 2> 7. Admit that the 5B poultry houses are still in use as of the 
<line: 3> date of service of this document upon Calvin Wells’s 
<line: 4> attorney. 

[TEXT]
<line: 6> (Id.).  

[TEXT]
<line: 8> On June 30, 2017, National Fire filed its Motion for Summary Judgment. In its 
<line: 9> motion, National Fire stated that Wells had not (1) filed initial disclosures, (2) produced 
<line: 10> responses to its Requests for Production, (3) disclosed expert witnesses, and (4) 
<line: 11> objected and/or responded to the Requests for Admission. On August 4, 2017, 
<line: 12> National Fire filed a reply, arguing the court should grant its summary judgment motion 
<line: 13> because Wells failed to file a response .  

[TEXT]
<line: 15> On August 7, 2017, Wells filed an untimely response to National Fire’s summary 
<line: 16> judgment motion, stating that Wells’s counsel had only “in the last days” received the 
<line: 17> motion, and, counsel did not see the motion on his computer. (Doc. 26). In addition to 
<line: 18> a “request” to more fully respond to the motion, Wells submitted: (1) the transcript and 
<line: 19> additional exhibits from the examination under oath that National Fire took of Wells 
<line: 20> (National Fire already submitted most of the material as “Exhibit A” to its summary 
<line: 21> judgment motion); and (2) a depreciation detail listing of CD Wells’s 2003 tax return. In 
<line: 22> his response, Wells further alleges that aerial photographs and his testimony reveal that 
<line: 23> the poultry houses were rebuilt in approximately 2002, as the depreciation detail 
<line: 24> allegedly portrays an update and equipment expenses for 2003. Wells also argues that he 
<line: 25> installed cement around the posts in his poultry houses.  

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 8 1231231

[TEXT]
<line: 2> On August 9, 2017, National Fire filed a reply in opposition to Wells’s response. 
<line: 3> (Doc. 29). In its reply, National Fire argues that Wells failed to altogether provide any 
<line: 4> initial disclosures. In addition, Wells never provided C.D. Wells’s 2003 depreciation 
<line: 5> record during his examination under oath, in initial disclosures, or in responses to the 
<line: 6> Requests for Production.  

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Furthermore, National Fire highlights that Wells failed to meet all discovery 
<line: 9> deadlines set forth in the parties’ Rule 16 Scheduling Order. At the time National Fire 
<line: 10> filed this reply, Wells had provided no expert report, no written discovery, no requests 
<line: 11> for depositions, no responses to National Fire’s Requests for Production, and no 
<line: 12> responses to National Fire’s Requests for Admissions. National Fire concluded that the 
<line: 13> court should deny Wells’s “request” for an extension of time to respond to the 
<line: 14> summary judgment motion. 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> On October 2, 2017, Wells filed responses to National Fire’s April 28, 2017, 
<line: 17> Requests for Admission. (Doc. 30). In his responses, Wells stated a general objection to 
<line: 18> the Requests for Admission on the grounds that the requests were “vague, ambiguous, 
<line: 19> overly broad, unduly burdensome or oppressive” and that they were not sufficiently 
<line: 20> descriptive so as to allow Wells the opportunity to lodge a meaningful response. 
<line: 21> Furthermore, Wells included this additional paragraph in his response: 

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 1-7. Wells objects to these requests in that they are not 
<line: 24> sufficiently descriptive so as to allow Wells to make a 
<line: 25> meaningful response. Without waiving said objection, Wells 

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 9 1231231

[TEXT]
<line: 2> denies paragraphs 1 through 7, that is all of the Request for 
<line: 3> Admissions. Wells has testified and states that the poultry 
<line: 4> houses were rebuilt after 1997 and even logic would state 
<line: 5> that the houses did not deteriorate at the same time and lean 
<line: 6> in the same direction. 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> On October 20, 2017, Wells filed a supplemental response to National Fire’s 
<line: 9> motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 31). The response consisted of an affidavit from 
<line: 10> Barry Willingham, the Revenue Commissioner for Cullman County, and an affidavit 
<line: 11> from Faye Cobbs, a purported IRS Enrolled Agent who also served as C.D. Wells’s tax 
<line: 12> preparer. (Docs. 32-1 and 32-2). 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> On November 1, 2017, National Fire filed a Motion to Strike Wells’s untimely 
<line: 15> responses to the Requests for Admission and his untimely filed supplemental response 
<line: 16> with affidavits. (Doc. 36). On November 2, 2017, the court issued a briefing schedule 
<line: 17> for National Fire’s Motion to Strike, ordering Wells to file a response within fourteen 
<line: 18> days and National Fire to file any reply within seven days thereafter. (Doc. 36). Wells 
<line: 19> never filed a response.

<line: 21> ANALYSIS  

[TITLE]
<line: 23> A.  
<line: 24> National Fire’s Motion to Strike 

[TEXT]
<line: 26> Before adjudicating the Motion for Summary Judgment, the court addresses 
<line: 27> National Fire’s Motion to Strike to determine whether Wells may rely upon specific 
<line: 28> evidence presented in his filings opposing summary judgment.  

[ABANDON]
<line: 30> 10 1231231

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Specifically, National Fire argues that the court should strike (1) Wells’s untimely 
<line: 3> responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission and (2) Wells’s untimely filed 
<line: 4> supplemental response with affidavits. Based upon the following discussion, the court 
<line: 5> GRANTS National Fire’s motion on both grounds. 

[TEXT]
<line: 7> 1.  
<line: 8> The Court Deems National Fire’s Requests for Admission as Admissions by Wells 
<line: 9> Dues to Wells Failure to Timely Respond to Them. 

[TEXT]
<line: 11> Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36(a) enables any party to “serve on any other 
<line: 12> party a written request to admit, for purposes of the pending action only, the truth of 
<line: 13> any matters within the scope of Rule 26(b)(1) relating to: (A) facts, the application of law 
<line: 14> to fact, or opinions about either; and (B) the genuineness of any described documents.” 
<line: 15> The Rule automatically deems unanswered or belatedly-answered responses to Rule 36 
<line: 16> requests as admissions: 

[TEXT]
<line: 18> A matter [of which an admission is requested] is admitted 
<line: 19> unless, within 30 days after being served, the party to whom 
<line: 20> the request is directed serves on the requesting party a 
<line: 21> written answer or objection addressed to the matter and 
<line: 22> signed by the party or its attorney. A shorter or longer time 
<line: 23> for responding may be stipulated to under Rule 29 or be 
<line: 24> ordered by the court.  

[TEXT]
<line: 26> Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a)(3).  

[TEXT]
<line: 28> Courts in this circuit routinely treat unanswered or belatedly-answered requests 
<line: 29> as legally-conclusive admissions. See, e.g., Garmely v. Cochran, 651 Fed. Appx. 933, 936 
<line: 30> (11th Cir. 2016)(citing Perez v. Miami-Dade Cnty., 297 F.3d 1255, 1263 (11th Cir. 2002)). 
<line: 31> Because Wells failed to respond to National Fire’s requests for admission within 30 days 

[ABANDON]
<line: 33> 11 1231231

[TEXT]
<line: 2> (indeed, more than five months after service of the requests), and did so without 
<line: 3> permission from the court or stipulations by National Fire, Rule 36(a)(3) automatically 
<line: 4> deems National Fire’s requests as admissions.  

[TEXT]
<line: 6> Rule 36(b) provides that “[a] matter admitted under this rule is conclusively 
<line: 7> established unless the court, on motion, permits the admission to be withdrawn or 
<line: 8> amended.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(b). The court allows withdrawal or amendment “if it 
<line: 9> would promote the presentation of the merits of the action and if the court is not 
<line: 10> persuaded that it would prejudice the requesting party in maintaining or defending the 
<line: 11> action on the merits.” Id; see also Smith v. First Nat’l Bank of Atlanta, 837 F.2d 1575, 
<line: 12> 1577(11th Cir. 1988). Here, Wells filed no motion to withdraw or to amend his 
<line: 13> automatically deemed admissions, but instead filed his responses months after the 
<line: 14> deadline set in the parties’ Scheduling Order. Furthermore, Wells has not addressed the 
<line: 15> issue in any of his responses and even failed to respond, pursuant to the court’s order, to 
<line: 16> National Fire’s Motion to Strike. As Rule 36(b) expressly provides for withdrawal only 
<line: 17> “on motion,” the court cannot sua sponte withdraw Wells’s admissions. See Jacobs v. 
<line: 18> Electronics Data Systems Corp., No. 2:05-CV-925-MHT, 2006 WL 3742202, *2 (M.D. Ala. 
<line: 19> Dec. 18, 2006)(citing Am. Auto. Ass’n v. AAA Legal Clinic, 930 F.2d 1117, 1120 (5th Cir. 
<line: 20> 1991)).  

[TEXT]
<line: 22> However, even if the court construed Wells’s untimely responses as a motion to 
<line: 23> withdraw his admissions, he fails the two-part test that governs this type of entreaty. 

[ABANDON]
<line: 25> 12 1231231

[TEXT]
<line: 2> This test focuses on the effect upon the litigation and prejudice to the resisting party, 
<line: 3> rather than the moving party’s justifications or lack thereof. Burch v. P.J. Cheese, Inc., No. 
<line: 4> 2:09-CV-1640-SLB, 2011 WL 13233278, *2 (N.D. Ala. Aug. 17, 2011). “First, the court 
<line: 5> considers whether the withdrawal will subserve the presentation of the merits, and 
<line: 6> second, it must determine whether the withdrawal will prejudice the party who obtained 
<line: 7> the admissions in its presentation of the case.” Perez v. Miami-Dada County, 297 F.3d 
<line: 8> 1255, 1264 (11th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1193 (2003). This two-part test specifies 
<line: 9> the limits of the district court’s discretion in permitting the withdrawal of admissions. 
<line: 10> Id. at 1265-66. A withdrawal subserves the presentation of the merits “when it aids in

<line: 15> Here, Wells fails to meet the two-part test for withdrawing his admissions. The 
<line: 16> first part of the test “emphasizes the importance of having the action resolved on the 
<line: 17> merits.” Perez, 297 F.3d at 1266 (quoting Smith, 837 F.2d at 1577). The moving party 
<line: 18> satisfies this part of the test “when upholding the admissions would practically eliminate 
<line: 19> any presentation of the merits of the case.” Id. at 1266 (quoting Hadley v. United States, 45 
<line: 20> F.3d 1345, 1348 (9th Cir. 1995)). For example, in Perez, the Eleventh Circuit found that 
<line: 21> the party satisfied the first part of the test because the items the district court deemed 
<line: 22> admitted “took the wind out of the defendants’ sails” and “conclusively established the

<line: 2> liability of both defendants under 42 U.S.C. §1983.” Id. In Hadley, the Ninth Circuit 
<line: 3> found that the moving party satisfied the first part of the test because the admissions 
<line: 4> “essentially admitted the necessary elements” of the plaintiff’s claims. 45 F.3d at 1348. 
<line: 5> Additionally, in Harden v. Target Corp., No. 09-60010-CIV, 2009 WL 1456349 (S.D. Fla. 
<line: 6> May 22, 2009), the court found that the first part was satisfied because the admissions

[TEXT]
<line: 9> National Fire’s Requests for Admission asked Wells to admit, inter alia, that any 
<line: 10> damage that occurred to the 5B houses was not caused by direct physical loss or damage 
<line: 11> during his insurance policy period, that any damage that did occur was a result of wear 
<line: 12> and tear, that the 5B houses were built prior to March 5, 1997, that Wells has no 
<line: 13> evidence that the 5B houses were built after March 5, 1997, that there was snow in the 
<line: 14> area of the houses on February 25, 2015, that he has no evidence to rebut the fact that 
<line: 15> the 5B houses were in existence as of November 3, 2000, and that the 5B houses are still 
<line: 16> in use as of today. These requests ask Wells to admit all essential elements regarding 
<line: 17> National Fire’s declaratory judgment claim, and, by incorporation, Wells’s 
<line: 18> breach-of-contract claim. Furthermore, as in Harden, those requests for admission that 
<line: 19> do not seek admission of essential elements do relate to matters that are “highly 
<line: 20> significant, if not central, to this litigation.” 2009 WL 1456349 at *2.

<line: 22> These requests, if deemed admitted, strongly bolster National Fire’s position on

<line: 4> admissions to plaintiff’s requests that asked defendant to admit several essential 
<line: 5> elements of plaintiff’s claims brought pursuant to Title VII, FMLA, EPA, and 42 U.S.C. 
<line: 6> §1981 satisfied the first part of the test).  

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Nevertheless, Wells falters miserably on the second part of the test. National Fire 
<line: 9> demonstrated that it would be prejudiced by allowing Wells to amend his deemed 
<line: 10> admissions to the requests after discovery. The Eleventh Circuit explained the nature of 
<line: 11> prejudice that the test contemplates: 

[TEXT]
<line: 13> The prejudice contemplated by the Rule is not simply that 
<line: 14> the party who initially obtained the admission will now have 
<line: 15> to convince the fact finder of its truth. Rather, it relates to 
<line: 16> the difficulty a party may face in proving its case, e.g., caused 
<line: 17> by the unavailability of key witnesses, because of the sudden 
<line: 18> need to obtain evidence with respect to questions previously 
<line: 19> answered by the admissions.

<line: 23> evidentiary burdens stemming from the process of possessing and then losing the 
<line: 24> admissions. See ADM Agri-Industries, Ltd. v. Harvey, 200 F.R.D. 467, 471 (M.D. Ala. 
<line: 25> 2001). Significantly, Wells served his responses after the end of the discovery period on 
<line: 26> May 31, 2017, and after National Fire filed a motion for summary judgment on June 30, 
<line: 27> 2017, utilizing Wells’s deemed admissions. Not only did Wells fail to file any type of

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Wells’s conduct has also caused uncertainty and delay for National Fire. In his 
<line: 6> examination under oath, Wells refused to answer certain questions pertaining to the 
<line: 7> matters at issue in this case. He served no initial disclosures or responses to National 
<line: 8> Fire’s Request for Production of Documents, essentially prejudicing National Fire as to 
<line: 9> disclosure of Wells’s witnesses and potential trial exhibits. Over five months after its 
<line: 10> due date, Wells simply files his responses to National Fire’s Requests for Admission 
<line: 11> with no explanation for the untimeliness and delay.  

[TEXT]
<line: 13> Applying the reasoning that the Middle District of Alabama elaborated in ADM

<line: 16> come to an end, the court might be more inclined to find that [National Fire] has not 
<line: 17> carried its burden to show prejudice from the withdrawal or amendment of the 
<line: 18> admissions.” 200 F.R.D. at 472. However, because Wells never gave the court a viable 
<line: 19> explanation for his past discovery noncompliance, and because Wells failed to respond 
<line: 20> to a court order that directed him to respond to National Fire’s Motion to Strike, the 
<line: 21> court sees no reason  to grant Wells the benefit of the doubt regarding his late 
<line: 22> discovery response.

<line: 12> As discussed previously, Rule 26(a)’s mandatory, initial disclosures provision 
<line: 13> requires parties to disclose the witnesses and documents they intend to use at trial in

<line: 17> Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c) (emphasis added). The court considers four factors under Rule

<line: 19> unfair prejudice or surprise of the opposing party; (2) the opposing party’s ability to cure

<line: 5> Wells has not complied with Rule 26(a)’s requirement for mandatory, initial

<line: 11> Furthermore, this court cannot classify Wells’s failure to timely file these 
<line: 12> affidavits as harmless. Cobbs’s affidavit purportedly contained important information 
<line: 13> regarding Wells’s father’s tax filings for the eleven poultry houses. Willingham’s 
<line: 14> affidavit purportedly contained relevant opinion evidence regarding the overhead 
<line: 15> photos of Wells’s poultry houses.4 Had National Fire known about this information in 
<line: 16> a timely manner, it would have possessed the opportunity to depose both individuals. 
<line: 17> Both affidavits are dated October 17, 2017, well after the deadline for discovery and 
<line: 18> nearly four months after National Fire filed its motion for summary judgment without 
<line: 19> any knowledge of Willingham or Cobbs.

<line: 21> National Fire properly filed a motion to strike these affidavits, and Wells chose to

<line: 6> The Court Grants National’s Fire’s Motion to Strike Wells’s

[TEXT]
<line: 9> The court must also determine whether it should grant Wells’s “request” to 
<line: 10> permit an untimely response to the summary judgment motion (Doc. 26), or deny 
<line: 11> Wells’s “request” by granting National Fire’s motion to strike Wells’s late response 
<line: 12> (Doc. 29).  As an initial matter, the court notes that Wells not only filed an initial 
<line: 13> untimely response containing its “request” (Doc. 26), it did not await any adjudication 
<line: 14> by the court as to the “request” and filed another response containing the affidavits the 
<line: 15> court struck in the previous section (Doc. 31).  Therefore, the court discerns the 
<line: 16> parties’ entreaties as whether it should permit or strike Wells’s responses, even though 
<line: 17> the later response constitutes a nullity because the court struck the affidavits at its heart.  
<line: 18> In any event, the court cannot excuse Wells’s abject failure to prosecute this action, and 
<line: 19> thus, strikes its summary judgment responses.

<line: 21> Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b) governs extensions of time in which to file

<line: 4> affirmative showing by the non-moving party of excusable neglect according to Rule 
<line: 5> 6(b), a court does not abuse its discretion when it refuses to accept out-of-time

<line: 11> See Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Associates Ltd. P’ship, 507 U.S. 380 (1993). Four 
<line: 12> factors inform the “excusable neglect” standard: (1) the danger of prejudice to the 
<line: 13> opposing party; (2) the length of the delay and its potential impact on the judicial 
<line: 14> proceedings; (3) the reason for the delay, including whether the movant had reasonable

<line: 19> Courts consistently hold that attorney oversight does not amount to excusable

<line: 21> district court adopted the defendant’s statement of facts as unopposed and granted

<line: 5> (11th Cir. 1986), the court emphasized that attorney oversight does not amount to a 
<line: 6> “good reason” for Rule 60(b)(1) relief “even though such a result appear[ed] to penalize 
<line: 7> innocent clients for the forgetfulness of their attorneys.” Revere, 362 Fed. Appx. at 999 
<line: 8> (quoting Solaroll, 803 F.2d at 1132).  

[TEXT]
<line: 10> Turning to the first factor under Pioneer Investments, National Fire argues that it 
<line: 11> will suffer serious prejudice if the court excuses Wells’s untimely submission of his 
<line: 12> response to the summary judgment motion. The circumstances in this case tilt the 
<line: 13> merits against Wells. National Fire heavily relied on Wells’s deemed admissions in its 
<line: 14> summary judgment motion. It submitted this motion fifteen months after filing the 
<line: 15> complaint and a year after the court released the Rule 16 Scheduling Order. At the time 
<line: 16> of the filing, Wells had provided no disclosures or responses required by the Scheduling 
<line: 17> Order and procedural rules. National Fire would suffer unfair prejudice if the court 
<line: 18> sustains Wells’s responses to the summary judgment motion, although the court notes 
<line: 19> again the sparse, probative value of the responses.  Notwithstanding the lack of 
<line: 20> probative value, the risk of prejudice for National Fire weighs in its favor on this factor. 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> As for the second factor regarding the delay’s duration and its potential impact 
<line: 23> on efficient judicial administration, if Wells had timely opposed National Fire’s Motion 

[ABANDON]
<line: 25> 21 1231231

[TEXT]
<line: 2> for Summary Judgment on June 30, 2017, he would have completed that filing on or 
<line: 3> before July 21, 2017. Instead, Wells filed his response on August 7, 2017, three days 
<line: 4> after National Fire timely filed a reply indicating that Wells had not filed a response and 
<line: 5> missed the deadline. Although this lapse in time between the due date of Wells’s 
<line: 6> opposition to National Fire’s motion for summary judgment and the filing date of 
<line: 7> Wells’s truncated response only spans two weeks, Wells merely asked for the court to 
<line: 8> grant “an extension of time to more fully respond to the Motion for Summary 
<line: 9> Judgment.” (Doc. 26 at 1). This lack of proactive conduct on the part of Wells and 
<line: 10> continued delay tilts the second factor in favor of denying Wells’s “request.”  

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Most importantly, the reason for the delay and lack of good faith weigh heavily 
<line: 13> against Wells. The reason for delay remains critical to the inquiry regarding whether an 
<line: 14> attorney’s failures constitute excusable neglect. See Travelers Cas. and Sur. Co. of America v. 
<line: 15> Thorington Elec. & Const. Co., No. 2:09-CV-37-WKW, *3 (M.D. Ala. Mar. 1, 2010); see also 
<line: 16> Demint v. Nationsbank Corp., 208 F.R.D. 639, 642 (M.D. Fla. 2002)(“[T]he starting point 
<line: 17> and common denominator (indeed, the sine qua non) in every case employing an analysis 
<line: 18> of excusable neglect is an explanation of the reason for the delay.”) Here, Wells’s 
<line: 19> attorney contends that his failure to respond to the motion for summary judgment 
<line: 20> stemmed from him receiving the motion “only in the last days” and that the motion 
<line: 21> “failed to be viewed” on his computer. (Doc. 26 at 1). He presents no evidence 
<line: 22> substantiating these reasons.  

[ABANDON]
<line: 24> 22 1231231

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Further, Wells missed every single discovery deadline at the time National Fire 
<line: 3> filed its Motion for Summary Judgment. Combined with the fact Wells later submitted 
<line: 4> affidavits from two witnesses three months after the deadline for his response, these 
<line: 5> actions demonstrate a lack of good faith. This is not a case where an “innocent 
<line: 6> oversight” or “slight mistake” caused the failure to respond. Compare Cheney v. Anchor 
<line: 7> Glass Container Corp., 71 F.3d 848, 850 (11th Cir. 1996)(finding that a miscommunication 
<line: 8> between lawyers resulting in a six-day late filing, where there was no indication of bad 
<line: 9> faith or prejudice, constituted “excusable neglect”); Walter v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield 
<line: 10> United of Wis., 181 F.3d 1198, 1201-02 (11th Cir. 1999)(finding that a secretary’s filing 
<line: 11> mistake resulting in a late response, where there was no indication of bad faith or 
<line: 12> prejudice, constituted “excusable neglect”). Thus, on balance, the court finds that Wells 
<line: 13> failed to demonstrate that his failure to respond to the motion for summary judgment 
<line: 14> constituted “excusable neglect.” Therefore, the court DENIES Wells’s “request” 
<line: 15> permit untimely responses to National Fire’s Motion for Summary Judgment and 
<line: 16> GRANTS National Fire’s request to strike Wells’s response.

<line: 3> judgment as a matter of law on the exclusion. See Fitzpatrick, 2 F.3d 1112, 1115 (11th Cir. 
<line: 4> 1993)(“The movant must show . . . on all the essential elements of its case on which it

<line: 8> Before examining National Fire’s contentions, one need delineate the burden on 
<line: 9> the substantive claims at issue.  Although National Fires seeks a declaratory judgment 
<line: 10> pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, et seq., the substantive burdens on the underlying, 
<line: 11> coercive claim – the breach-of-contract dispute – does not shift.  Medtronic, Inc. v. 
<line: 12> Mirowski Family Ventures, LLC, __U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 843, 850 (2014) (“We have long 
<line: 13> considered ‘the operation of the Declaratory Judgment Act’ to be only ‘procedural,’ 
<line: 14> leaving ‘substantive rights unchanged.’  . . .  And we have held that ‘the burden of 
<line: 15> proof’ is a ‘substantive’ aspect of a claim.”) (citations omitted).  Therefore, the coercive 
<line: 16> claim underlying National Fire’s declaratory judgment action constitutes Wells’s 
<line: 17> breach-of-contract claim, which comprises Wells’s counterclaim in this case.  As a 
<line: 18> result, the summary judgment analysis proceeds identically as to National Fire’s 
<line: 19> declaratory judgment claim and Wells’s breach-of-contract counterclaim because of the 
<line: 20> nature of declaratory judgment actions.

<line: 21> Wells’s claim states that his poultry houses leaned about six inches due to the 
<line: 22> weight of ice and snow from a February 25, 2015, snowstorm. (Doc. 21-3).  National 
<line: 23> Fire argues that Wells cannot prove that any direct physical loss or damage commencing

<line: 2> In addition to this deemed admission, as the Background illustrates Parker’s reports

<line: 4> Therefore, the court finds no genuine dispute of material fact and that no coverage

<line: 8> wild-eyed hope that the other side will fail to answer and therefore 
<line: 9> admit essential elements (that the party has already denied in its

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Admittedly, Wells attempted to oppose summary judgment with other evidence that tends to 
<line: 17> contradict the admissions. The Willingham and Cobbs affidavits seek to oppose National Fire’s 
<line: 18> argument that the 5B houses are more than fifteen years old. Wells uses his father’s tax return to 
<line: 19> disprove the same argument from National Fire.  

[TEXT]
<line: 21> However, “a party cannot rebut its own admissions by introducing evidence that contradicts 
<line: 22> it.” Jacobs v. Electronics Data Systems Corp., No. 2:05-CV-925-MHT, 2006 WL 3742202, *3 (M.D. Ala. 
<line: 23> Dec. 18, 2006) (citing In re Carney, 258 F.3d 415, 420 (5th Cir. 2001))(“Since Rule 36 admissions, 
<line: 24> whether express or by default, are conclusive as to the matters admitted, they cannot be overcome at 
<line: 25> the summary judgment stage by contradictory affidavit testimony or other evidence in the summary 
<line: 26> judgment record.”). A district court commits reversible error if it discounts facts that have been 
<line: 27> “conclusively established” through Rule 36 admissions, “even if it ‘[finds] more credible evidence of 
<line: 28> the party against whom the admissions operate.’” Hicks v. Mercedes-Benz U.S. International, Inc., No. 
<line: 29> 7:08-CV-0536-LSC, 2012 WL 13024371, *2 (N.D. Ala. Jul. 2, 2012)(quoting Williams v. City of Dothan,

<line: 34> Because this court has deemed National Fire’s Requests for Admission as admitted, and there 
<line: 35> exists no indication that National Fire utilized Rule 36 requests to “harass” Wells or as “a weapon” 
<line: 36> “with the wild-eyed hope” that it would “fail to answer and . . . admit essential elements,” the court will

<line: 3> The Policy Excludes Any Alleged Damage to Wells’s 5B Houses. 

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Although the insured assumes the burden of persuasion regarding coverage 
<line: 6> issues, any question involving the application of an exclusion or an assertion that the 
<line: 7> policy does not apply for some reason other than the scope of coverage shifts the 
<line: 8> burden to the insurer. See Taylor, 513 Fed. Appx. at 813 (listing Alabama Supreme Court 
<line: 9> cases that held the same). The Alabama Supreme Court provides: 

[TEXT]
<line: 11> Exceptions to coverage must be interpreted as narrowly as 
<line: 12> possible in order to provide maximum coverage to the 
<line: 13> insured. However, courts are not at liberty to rewrite policies 
<line: 14> to provide coverage not intended by the parties. In the 
<line: 15> absence of statutory provisions to the contrary, insurance 
<line: 16> companies have the right to limit their liability and write 
<line: 17> policies with narrow coverage. If there is no ambiguity, 
<line: 18> courts must enforce insurance contracts as written and 
<line: 19> cannot defeat express provisions in a policy, including 
<line: 20> exclusions from coverage, by making a new contract for the 
<line: 21> parties.

[TEXT]
<line: 26> The insurance policy more fully describes the exclusions applicable in this case, 
<line: 27> in particular excluding any loss or damage resulting from “wear and tear”; decay and 
<line: 28> deterioration; and faulty, inadequate, or defective construction, repair, renovation, or 
<line: 29> remodeling.  (Doc. 13 at 57, 59-60.)  There exists no ambiguity in the above exclusion. 
<line: 30> Therefore, the court must enforce the exclusion as written, and exclude coverage if

[TEXT]
<line: 2> National Fire demonstrates that there is no genuine issue of material fact that its policy 
<line: 3> exclusions cover any alleged damage to Wells’s 5B houses. 

[TEXT]
<line: 5> National Fire successfully meets this burden. National Fire refers to Parker’s 
<line: 6> report, where he concludes that the “lack of a proper foundation, inadequate anchoring, 
<line: 7> and age-related factors would be a cause of any leaning condition of the poultry 
<line: 8> houses.” (Doc. 21-4 at 5). These findings comport with the court’s reading of this 
<line: 9> exclusion, as these faults correspond to “wear and tear” of the structures and “faulty or 
<line: 10> inadequate construction.” Wells’s sole rejoinder to the policy-exclusion manifests as an 
<line: 11> assertion there existed cement around the posts of his 5B houses, a finding contrary to 
<line: 12> Parker’s report.  

[TEXT]
<line: 14> In any event, National Fire’s second Request for Admission conclusively 
<line: 15> established that the exclusion bars Wells’s claim: 

[TEXT]
<line: 17> 2. Admit that to the extent there is any damage to any of the 
<line: 18> 5B poultry houses, said damage is a result of wear and 
<line: 19> tear, deterioration, settling, cracking, shrinking, lack of a 
<line: 20> proper foundation or inadequate anchoring.  

[TEXT]
<line: 22> Wells’s deemed admission and lack of evidence, along with National Fire’s evidentiary 
<line: 23> support, confirm that this Policy exclusion applies to Wells’s claim.  

[TEXT]
<line: 25> 4.  
<line: 26> The “Animal Confinement Coverage Limitations Based on Actual Building 
<line: 27> Age” Policy Endorsement Prohibits Coverage for Wells’s Claim 

[TEXT]
<line: 29> In addition, National Fire states that the Animal Confinement Endorsement in 
<line: 30> Wells’s policy independently prohibits coverage of his claim. In particular, this 

[ABANDON]
<line: 32> 31 1231231

[TEXT]
<line: 2> endorsement explicitly provides no coverage for loss or damage caused by weight of 
<line: 3> snow, ice, or sleet for animal confinement buildings that are aged more than fifteen (15) 
<line: 4> years. (Doc. 13 at 79). In Parker’s report and in National Fire’s denial letter to Wells, 
<line: 5> National Fire states that the aerial photos they reviewed from March 5, 1997, shows that 
<line: 6> the 5B houses existed on that particular date.7 Even if the court reviewed the affidavits 
<line: 7> from Willingham and Cobbs on their merits, they raise no genuine issue of material fact. 
<line: 8> Neither affidavit provides evidence that disputes National Fire’s finding that the 
<line: 9> original construction of the 5B homes occurred on or before March 5, 1997.8  

[TEXT]
<line: 11> Furthermore, National Fire’s third Request for Admission, which this court has 
<line: 12> deemed admitted, states: 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> 1. Admit that all of the 5B poultry houses were built prior to 
<line: 15> March 5, 1997. 

[TEXT]
<line: 17> Absent any additional evidence, the court finds that National Fire’s Animal 
<line: 18> Confinement endorsement explicitly prohibits coverage for Wells’s claims. Therefore, 
<line: 19> the court GRANTS summary judgment for National Fire on this basis as well.  

[ABANDON]
<line: 21> 7 Not only does National Fire provide its own evidence to support this claim, but National Fire argues 
<line: 22> the 2003 depreciation tables Wells sought to include in its responses admitted the actual age of the 5B 
<line: 23> houses. (Doc. 29 at 2, n.1). 

[ABANDON]
<line: 25> 32 
<line: 26> 8 Willingham’s affidavit purportedly demonstrated that the poultry houses depicted in 1997 differ 
<line: 27> from the houses depicted in later photographs contained in county records and Google Earth results.  
<line: 28> This submissions starkly portray the shortcomings in Wells’s evidence:  not only did the undersigned 
<line: 29> fail to discern any appreciable distinction among the photographs, the items did not traverse the 
<line: 30> gauntlet of adversarial litigation to test their probative value.
