<line: 46> IN PART DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS

[TEXT]
<line: 48> On September 13, 2017, Defendants Deutsche Bank
<line: 49> National Trust Company, as Trustee for American Home Mortgage
<line: 50> Assets Trust 2007-3, Mortgage-Backed Pass-Through Certificates
<line: 51> Series 2007 (“Deutsche Bank as Trustee”); Ocwen Loan Servicing,
<line: 52> LLC (“Ocwen”); and Homeward Residential, Inc., formerly known as
<line: 53> American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc. (“AHMSI,” collectively,
<line: 54> “Defendants”), filed their Motion to Dismiss (“Motion”).  [Dkt.
<line: 55> no. 5.]  Pro se Plaintiff Luis C. Chavez, Individually and as
<line: 56> Special Administrator of the Estate of Marcario Araujo Chavez
<line: 57> (“Plaintiff”), filed his memorandum in opposition on January 29,

[TEXT]
<line: 2> 2018, and Defendants filed their reply on February 5, 2018. 
<line: 3> [Dkt. nos. 17, 20.]  The Court finds this matter suitable for
<line: 4> disposition without a hearing pursuant to Rule LR7.2(d) of the
<line: 5> Local Rules of Practice of the United States District Court for
<line: 6> the District of Hawai`i (“Local Rules”).  Defendants’ Motion is
<line: 7> hereby granted in part and denied in part for the reasons set
<line: 8> forth below.  The Motion is granted insofar as Plaintiff’s First
<line: 9> Amended Complaint is dismissed without prejudice, with the
<line: 10> exception of his claim for punitive damages, which is dismissed
<line: 11> with prejudice.

[TITLE]
<line: 13> BACKGROUND

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Plaintiff alleges he is the owner of certain real
<line: 16> property in Makawao, Hawai`i (“the Property”), and Defendants
<line: 17> wrongfully attempted to foreclose upon the Property in a state
<line: 18> court action, Deutsche Bank v. Chavez, Civil No. 11-1-0849
<line: 19> (“Foreclosure Action”).  [Notice of Removal of Civil Action
<line: 20> (“Notice of Removal”), filed 9/6/17 (dkt. no. 1), Decl. of
<line: 21> J. Blaine Rogers (“Rogers Removal Decl.”), Exh. C at 5-21 (First
<line: 22> Amended Complaint, filed 7/6/17 in state court),1 at ¶¶ 1, 7.] 

[ABANDON]

<line: 25> consecutively paginated.  All citations to Exhibit C refer to the
<line: 26> page numbers assigned in the district court’s electronic case
<line: 27> filing system.
<line: 28> Plaintiff filed his original complaint on April 6, 2016, in
<line: 29> state court.  There is no indication in the state court docket
<line: 30> that Plaintiff served his original complaint.  See Rogers Removal
<line: 31> Decl., Exh. A (state court docket sheet).  Plaintiff also filed a

[ABANDON]
<line: 34> 2

[TEXT]
<line: 2> On April 8, 2015, the state court dismissed the Foreclosure
<line: 3> Action, without prejudice, for lack of prosecution.  [Id. at
<line: 4> ¶ 7.]  According to the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff’s
<line: 5> mortgage loan on the Property was not in default at the time the
<line: 6> Foreclosure Action commenced, but appeared that way because
<line: 7> Defendants had misdirected Plaintiff’s funds.  Plaintiff alleges
<line: 8> that, as of October 4, 2010, the loan was current.  [Id. at
<line: 9> ¶¶ 8-10.]

[TEXT]
<line: 11> Macario Araujo Chavez (“M.A. Chavez”) was Plaintiff’s
<line: 12> father, and Plaintiff became the administrator of the estate
<line: 13> after M.A. Chavez’s death on November 30, 2010.  Until
<line: 14> M.A. Chavez’s death, he and Plaintiff worked with AHMSI to make
<line: 15> sure that payments were being credited to the proper account. 
<line: 16> After M.A. Chavez’s death, Plaintiff continued to work with
<line: 17> AHMSI.  According to Plaintiff, beginning in March 2010,
<line: 18> Plaintiff began receiving significant payments on insurance
<line: 19> claims, and these payments were made through AHMSI and
<line: 20> M.A. Chavez.  However, in spite of repeated instructions from
<line: 21> Plaintiff, AHMSI did not properly credit the insurance payments
<line: 22> to the mortgage loan on the Property.  [Id. at ¶¶ 11-13.]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> According to Plaintiff, the November 2013 accounting
<line: 3> for the mortgage loan was not correct and, by January 2014, Ocwen
<line: 4> still had $1,656.84 from a September 2010 insurance claim that it
<line: 5> had been holding in a different loan account instead of applying
<line: 6> it to the mortgage loan account.  [Id. at ¶ 14.]  In addition,
<line: 7> Plaintiff alleges that, in 2010 and 2011, the escrow account “was
<line: 8> consistently over-funded by $4,000.00 or more (over $280 per
<line: 9> month)” because of AHMSI’s repeated failure to collect the
<line: 10> correct property tax amounts.  [Id. at ¶ 15.]  Plaintiff
<line: 11> repeatedly contacted AHMSI to address the over-collection
<line: 12> problem, but the overages persisted for a two-year period.  [Id.
<line: 13> at ¶ 19.]  Plaintiff alleges he “received promises that were
<line: 14> broken as to payment amounts and applications of funds.”  [Id. at
<line: 15> ¶ 32.]  Further, although Defendants asserted Plaintiff defaulted
<line: 16> on the January 2011 payment for the mortgage loan, there was
<line: 17> almost a $900 surplus in the escrow account at that time.  [Id.
<line: 18> at ¶ 16.]  The First Amended Complaint includes various other
<line: 19> examples of alleged over-collection and misapplication of funds. 
<line: 20> [Id. at ¶¶ 16-18, 20-22, 24-28.]

[TEXT]
<line: 22> Plaintiff alleges Ocwen “fabricated a misrepresentation
<line: 23> to intentional [sic] hide funds that should have been applied to
<line: 24> Plaintiffs [sic] loan, prior to bringing a foreclosure,” while
<line: 25> “AHMSI engaged in a pattern of negligent actions upon Plaintiff
<line: 26> on how the funds would be applied.”  [Id. at ¶ 14.]  He also

[ABANDON]
<line: 28> 4

[TEXT]
<line: 2> alleges “Defendants continually engaged in a willful
<line: 3> misapplication and non-application of funds and improper time of
<line: 4> when funds were applied, or not even applied.”  [Id. at ¶ 20.]
<line: 5> Plaintiff believes AHMSI held sufficient funds that
<line: 6> should have been credited to the mortgage loan and that
<line: 7> foreclosure was not warranted.  [Id. at ¶ 29.]  Further, a
<line: 8> $4,400.00 payment was sent to AHMSI on April 21, 2011, which
<line: 9> should have covered the amounts that were due on April 1, 2011,
<line: 10> but AHMSI refused the payment, which Plaintiff alleges “made it
<line: 11> impossible to perform from that point forward.”  [Id. at ¶ 30.] 
<line: 12> Plaintiff believes his mortgage loan was reinstated on August 7,
<line: 13> 2013, but the payments still were not properly credited (assuming
<line: 14> they were accepted at all), and he was still faced with
<line: 15> improperly imposed interest and fees.  [Id. at ¶ 38.]

[TEXT]
<line: 17> According to Plaintiff, in October and December 2013,
<line: 18> Ocwen’s counsel sent Plaintiff letters, even though the
<line: 19> foreclosure case was still active and Plaintiff was represented
<line: 20> by counsel.  Further, Plaintiff alleges Defendants acted in bad
<line: 21> faith and with malicious intent so that they could foreclose on
<line: 22> the Property.  [Id. at ¶¶ 39-40.]

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Plaintiff alleges the following claims: unfair and
<line: 25> deceptive acts and practices (“UDAP”), under Haw. Rev. Stat.
<line: 26> Chapters 480 and 481A (“Count I”); [id. at ¶¶ 41-53;] breach of
<line: 27> the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (“Count II”);

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> 5

[TEXT]
<line: 2> [id. at ¶¶ 54-56;] promissory estoppel (“Count III”); [id. at
<line: 3> ¶¶ 57-62;] and a claim for punitive damages (“Count IV”), [id. at
<line: 4> ¶¶ 63-64].  Plaintiff prays for: actual, treble, and punitive
<line: 5> damages; a ruling that, if Defendants hold a valid mortgage, they
<line: 6> must properly apply Plaintiff’s funds; an order eliminating all
<line: 7> of Plaintiff’s interest, late fees, and other changes that
<line: 8> resulted from Defendants’ failure to determine the correct loan
<line: 9> balance, if any; reasonable attorney’s fees and costs; and any
<line: 10> other appropriate relief.  [Id. at pg. 15.]

[TEXT]
<line: 12> The Errata adds allegations that Ocwen has violated the
<line: 13> Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”), 15 U.S.C. § 1692,
<line: 14> et seq., in particular, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692(e) and 1692(f). 
<line: 15> [Rogers Removal Decl., Exh. C at 2-3.]  The Errata also adds a
<line: 16> prayer for relief stating that, if the Court concludes Deutsche
<line: 17> Bank as Trustee held a valid assignment, this Court should
<line: 18> either: issue an order requiring Deutsche Bank as Trustee to
<line: 19> properly apply his funds and to eliminate his interest, late
<line: 20> fees, and other charges caused by the wrongful assessments; or
<line: 21> enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor for wrongful foreclosure.

[TEXT]
<line: 25> Defendants were served with and/or received a copy of
<line: 26> the First Amended Complaint on or around August 7, 2017.  [Notice
<line: 27> of Removal at ¶ 6 (citing Rogers Removal Decl. at ¶ 10).]  The
<line: 28> case was removed based on diversity jurisdiction and federal

<line: 3> at ¶¶ 7, 24-26.]

[TEXT]
<line: 5> While Plaintiff’s original complaint was pending in the
<line: 6> state court, Plaintiff, through counsel, filed Chavez v. Deutsche
<line: 7> Bank National Trust Co., et al., CV 17-00141 DKW-RLP, in this
<line: 8> district court (“First Federal Action”).  The Complaint in the
<line: 9> First Federal Action was based upon substantially the same
<line: 10> factual allegations and theories as in the instant case.  See
<line: 11> Rogers Removal Decl., Exh. B (Complaint in First Federal Action). 
<line: 12> The First Federal Action alleged the following claims: UDAP
<line: 13> violations; a claim for declaratory judgment; wrongful
<line: 14> foreclosure; FDCPA violations; and promissory estoppel.  [Id. at
<line: 15> ¶¶ 40-56.]  Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the First Federal
<line: 16> Action.  [CV 17-141, Notice of Dismissal Without Prejudice
<line: 17> Pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i), filed 8/4/17 (dkt. no. 10).]

[TEXT]
<line: 19> In the instant Motion, Defendants ask this Court to
<line: 20> dismiss all of Plaintiff’s claims in the First Amended Complaint
<line: 21> and the Errata with prejudice because they fail to state a claim
<line: 22> upon which relief can be granted.  [Motion at 2.]

<line: 24> DISCUSSION

<line: 26> I.
<line: 27> Standing

[TEXT]
<line: 29> Defendants state that, on March 7, 2007, M.A. Chavez
<line: 30> executed a promissory note for a $650,000 loan from American Home
<line: 31> Mortgage (“AHM” and “the Note”).  [Mem. in Supp. of Motion at 2

[ABANDON]
<line: 33> 7

[TEXT]
<line: 2> (citing First Amended Complaint, Exh. 38, ¶ 7).2]  The Note was
<line: 3> secured by a Mortgage between M.A. Chavez, as borrower, and AHM
<line: 4> as the lender, and the Mortgage encumbered the Property.  The
<line: 5> Mortgage was recorded with the State of Hawai`i Bureau of
<line: 6> Conveyances as document number 2007-046460.  [Motion, Decl. of
<line: 7> J. Blaine Rogers (“Rogers Motion Decl.”), Exh. A (Mortgage).3] 
<line: 8> The Mortgage does not list Plaintiff as a borrower, and it does
<line: 9> not reflect that Plaintiff signed the Note.  [Id. at Page 1 of 15
<line: 10> and Page 2 of 15.]  Defendants state the Note was transferred,
<line: 11> and the Mortgage was assigned, to Deutsche Bank as Trustee. 
<line: 12> [Mem. in Supp. of Motion at 3 (citing First Amended Complaint,
<line: 13> Exh. 38 at ¶ 9).]  Although Plaintiff is neither a party to nor a
<line: 14> beneficiary of the Mortgage, his claims are premised upon the
<line: 15> position that he was improperly deemed to be in default on the
<line: 16> Mortgage.  [Id. at 3-4.]  Defendants argue Plaintiff lacks
<line: 17> standing to pursue the instant case because: he cannot represent

[ABANDON]
<line: 19> 2 Defendants argue this Court may consider the fifty
<line: 20> exhibits to the First Amended Complaint in ruling on the Motion.

<line: 22> v. Arizona Mall of Tempe, Inc., 583 F.2d 426, 429-30 (9th Cir.
<line: 23> 1978)).]  The version of the First Amended Complaint attached to
<line: 24> the Notice of Removal does not include the attachments.  However,
<line: 25> Plaintiff filed a version of the First Amended Complaint with the
<line: 26> exhibits.  [Notice of Case Assignment, filed 6/7/18 (dkt. no.

<line: 29> 3 Defendants ask this Court to take judicial notice of the
<line: 30> Mortgage pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 201.  That request is granted
<line: 31> because the Mortgage is a public record and its recording and
<line: 32> contents “can be accurately and readily determined from sources

<line: 6> A.
<line: 7> Plaintiff as Special Administrator

[TEXT]
<line: 9> There is no indication that Plaintiff is an attorney
<line: 10> licensed to practice in this district.  He therefore is limited
<line: 11> to represent himself, in his individual capacity, pro se.  See
<line: 12> Simon v. Hartford Life, Inc., 546 F.3d 661, 664 (9th Cir. 2008)
<line: 13> (stating “the privilege to represent oneself pro se provided by
<line: 14> [28 U.S.C.] § 1654 is personal to the litigant and does not
<line: 15> extend to other parties or entities”); C.E. Pope Equity Tr. v.
<line: 16> United States, 818 F.2d 696 (9th Cir. 1987) (holding that a
<line: 17> non-attorney cannot appear pro se on behalf of a trust). 
<line: 18> Defendants’ Motion must be granted as to the claims Plaintiff
<line: 19> attempts to assert on behalf of M.A. Chavez’s estate because this
<line: 20> Court cannot grant Plaintiff the relief he seeks in those claims. 
<line: 21> See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (stating that the defense of
<line: 22> “failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted” can
<line: 23> be asserted by motion).  All of Plaintiff’s claims alleged on
<line: 24> behalf of M.A. Chavez’s estate are dismissed.

<line: 26> B.
<line: 27> Plaintiff’s Individual Capacity

[TEXT]
<line: 29> In order to establish constitutional standing to pursue
<line: 30> claims in his individual capacity, Plaintiff
<line: 31> must show (1) [he] has suffered an “injury in
<line: 32> fact” that is (a) concrete and particularized and

[ABANDON]
<line: 34> 9

[TEXT]
<line: 2> (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or
<line: 3> hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable
<line: 4> to the challenged action of the defendant; and
<line: 5> (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely
<line: 6> speculative, that the injury will be redressed by
<line: 7> a favorable decision. . . .

<line: 9> See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envt’l Servs. (TOC),
<line: 10> Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81 (2000).

[TEXT]
<line: 12> In ruling on Defendants’ Motion, this Court must assume
<line: 13> all of the factual allegations in the First Amended Complaint are
<line: 14> true.  See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (stating
<line: 15> for “the purposes of a motion to dismiss we must take all of the
<line: 16> factual allegations in the complaint as true”).  Even with that
<line: 17> assumption, Plaintiff has not alleged that he, in his individual
<line: 18> capacity, has suffered a concrete, particularized, actual injury
<line: 19> or that he is imminently facing such an injury.  The Foreclosure
<line: 20> Action was dismissed and, moreover, Plaintiff is not a party to
<line: 21> either the Note or the Mortgage.  Because the First Amended
<line: 22> Complaint and Errata fail to plead a plausible basis for
<line: 23> Plaintiff’s standing to pursue the claims in this case, the
<line: 24> Motion must be granted as to Plaintiff’s claims brought in his
<line: 25> individual capacity.  See id. (“To survive a motion to dismiss, a
<line: 26> complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as
<line: 27> true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its
<line: 28> face.’” (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,
<line: 29> 570 (2007))).  All of Plaintiff’s claims brought on his own
<line: 30> behalf are dismissed.

<line: 2> C.
<line: 3> With or Without Prejudice

[TEXT]
<line: 5> “Unless it is absolutely clear that no amendment can
<line: 6> cure the defect” – in other words, unless amendment would be
<line: 7> futile – “a pro se litigant is entitled to notice of the
<line: 8> complaint’s deficiencies and an opportunity to amend prior to
<line: 9> dismissal of the action.”  Lucas v. Dep’t of Corr., 66 F.3d 245,
<line: 10> 248 (9th Cir. 1995).  Plaintiff can pursue claims on behalf of
<line: 11> M.A. Chavez’s estate if he retains counsel.  Further, it is
<line: 12> arguably possible for Plaintiff to amend his claims to allege a
<line: 13> plausible basis for standing by adding allegations showing that
<line: 14> he has personally been injured, or is imminently facing injury,
<line: 15> because of the alleged problems with M.A. Chavez’s mortgage loan
<line: 16> account.  The dismissal of the First Amended Complaint must
<line: 17> therefore be without prejudice.  To the extent Defendants ask
<line: 18> this Court to dismiss all of Plaintiff’s claims with prejudice,
<line: 19> the Motion is denied.

<line: 21> II.
<line: 22> Defendants’ Other Arguments

[TEXT]
<line: 24> This Court declines to rule upon the majority of the
<line: 25> other arguments in the Motion at this time because the amendments
<line: 26> Plaintiff may make to address his standing may affect the
<line: 27> analysis of these arguments.  However, this Court does caution
<line: 28> Plaintiff that, insofar as he alleges “the applicable period” for
<line: 29> his claims is 2010 to 2011, [First Amended Complaint at ¶ 17,]
<line: 30> his UDAP claim and his FDCPA claim may be time-barred.  See Haw.

<line: 5> § 1692k(d) (“An action to enforce any liability created by this

<line: 7> district court without regard to the amount in controversy, or in
<line: 8> any other court of competent jurisdiction, within one year from
<line: 9> the date on which the violation occurs.”).  Plaintiff may be able
<line: 10> to address the time-bar issue by pleading facts that would
<line: 11> support rulings that, for example, there was a continuing
<line: 12> violation or the applicable limitations period was tolled.

[TEXT]
<line: 14> The only claim that must be dismissed with prejudice is
<line: 15> Count IV, Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages.  Counts I, II,
<line: 16> and III are Hawai`i state law claims, and

<line: 15> F 08-117 LJO TAG, 2008 WL 4158432, at *5 (E.D.
<line: 16> Cal. Sept. 4, 2008)).  Based on the language of
<line: 17> the statute, the Court finds these opinions
<line: 18> persuasive and finds that Plaintiff is not
<line: 19> entitled to punitive damages.

<line: 22> 5269400, at *7 (D. Hawai`i Sept. 21, 2012), report and
<line: 23> recommendation adopted, 2012 WL 5269390 (Oct. 22, 2012).  This
<line: 24> Court also finds the above caselaw to be persuasive and concludes
<line: 25> that Plaintiff cannot recover punitive damages for his FDCPA
<line: 26> claim.

[TEXT]
<line: 28> The dismissal of Count IV is therefore with prejudice. 
<line: 29> This dismissal, however, does not preclude Plaintiff from
<line: 30> including a request for punitive damages in his prayer for relief
<line: 31> for his state law claims, if such relief is appropriate based on
<line: 32> the factual allegations of this case.

[TITLE]
<line: 34> III. Summary and Leave to Amend

[TEXT]
<line: 36> All of Plaintiff’s claims are dismissed without
<line: 37> prejudice, except Count IV, which is dismissed with prejudice. 

[ABANDON]
<line: 39> 13

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Plaintiff will therefore be allowed to file a second amended
<line: 3> complaint that alleges all of the claims in the First Amended
<line: 4> Complaint and the Errata, except for Count IV.  This Court
<line: 5> reminds Plaintiff that his second amended complaint must address
<line: 6> the defects discussed in this Order, including the retention of
<line: 7> counsel to represent him if he wishes to pursue claims on behalf
<line: 8> of M.A. Chavez’s estate.  The Court orders Plaintiff to file his
<line: 9> second amended complaint by September 21, 2018.

[TEXT]
<line: 11> The Court cautions Plaintiff that his second amended
<line: 12> complaint must state all of his remaining claims – i.e., his UDAP
<line: 13> claim, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair
<line: 14> dealing claim, his promissory estoppel claim, and his FDCPA claim
<line: 15> – as well as all of the factual allegations, exhibits, and legal
<line: 16> theories that these claims rely upon.  Plaintiff cannot rely upon
<line: 17> or incorporate by reference any portion of his original Complaint
<line: 18> or his First Amended Complaint.  This Court will not consider
<line: 19> Plaintiff’s second amended complaint collectively with his prior
<line: 20> filings in this case.  Further, Plaintiff is not allowed to add
<line: 21> any new claims, parties, or theories of liability in the second
<line: 22> amended complaint.  If he wishes to do, he must file a motion for
<line: 23> leave to amend, and that motion will be considered by the
<line: 24> magistrate judge.4

[ABANDON]
<line: 26> 4 If Plaintiff wishes to file a motion for leave to amend,
<line: 27> he must also move for an amendment of the scheduling order
<line: 28> (continued...)

<line: 30> 14

[TEXT]
<line: 2> This Court also cautions Plaintiff that, if he fails to
<line: 3> file his second amended complaint by September 21, 2018, his
<line: 4> claims will be dismissed with prejudice.  In other words,
<line: 5> Plaintiff will no longer have any claims remaining in this case,
<line: 6> and the case will be closed.  Further, if any claim in
<line: 7> Plaintiff’s second amended complaint fails to address the defects
<line: 8> identified in this Order, that claim may be dismissed with
<line: 9> prejudice.

[TITLE]
<line: 11> CONCLUSION

[TEXT]
<line: 13> On the basis of the foregoing, Defendants’ Motion to
<line: 14> Dismiss, filed September 13, 2017, is HEREBY GRANTED IN PART AND
<line: 15> DENIED IN PART.  The Motion is GRANTED insofar as: Plaintiff’s
<line: 16> First Amended Complaint, filed on July 6, 2017 in state court, is
<line: 17> DISMISSED, in its entirety; and the dismissal of Count IV –
<line: 18> Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages – is WITH PREJUDICE.  The
<line: 19> Motion is DENIED insofar as the dismissal of all of Plaintiff’s
<line: 20> other claims is WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

[TEXT]
<line: 22> Plaintiff must file his second amended complaint by
<line: 23> September 21, 2018, and it must comply with the rulings in this
<line: 24> Order.  This Court EMPHASIZES that the filing of any motion for

[ABANDON]
<line: 26> 4 (...continued)
<line: 27> because the deadline to add parties and amend pleadings passed on
<line: 28> June 15, 2018.  [Amended Rule 16 Scheduling Order, filed 5/18/18
<line: 29> (dkt. no. 28), at ¶ 5.]

[ABANDON]
<line: 31> 15

[TEXT]
<line: 2> reconsideration of this Order does not affect the deadline for
<line: 3> Plaintiff to file his second amended complaint.

[TEXT]
<line: 5> IT IS SO ORDERED.
