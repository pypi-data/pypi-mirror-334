<line: 34> MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 36> William Deiker has brought a proposed class action suit against TrueAccord 
<line: 37> Corporation alleging violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 
<line: 38> U.S.C. § 1692 et seq. R. 1, Compl.1 Deiker alleges that TrueAccord sent him emails 
<line: 39> containing false and misleading statements in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1692e. Id. 
<line: 40> ¶¶ 46–47. Deiker also alleges that the emails amount to “unfair and unconscionable 
<line: 41> means” to collect a debt in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1692f. Id. ¶¶ 49–50. Pending now 
<line: 42> is TrueAccord’s motion for judgment on the pleadings, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), in which 
<line: 43> the defense argues that the emails did not, as a matter of law, violated the FDCPA. 
<line: 44> R. 36, Mot. J. Pleadings. But before evaluating whether the emails may form the ba-
<line: 45> sis of valid claims under Sections 1692e and 1692f, the Court must address a sub-
<line: 46> stantial question on Article III standing given recent Seventh Circuit case law.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> Because the Court has an independent obligation to address Article III standing, and 
<line: 5> because it is a threshold issue, the motion for judgment on the pleadings is termi-
<line: 6> nated without prejudice for now. Instead, the Court explains why the current allega-
<line: 7> tions almost surely are insufficient to assert Article III standing. Before dismissing 
<line: 8> this suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, however, the Court will allow the par-
<line: 9> ties to file position papers addressing whether Deiker has established an injury-in-
<line: 10> fact in his pleadings and has standing to bring this suit. 

[TITLE]
<line: 12> I. Background 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> In 2018, William Deiker defaulted on a credit card issued to him by Credit One 
<line: 15> Bank, N.A. Compl. ¶¶ 9, 11. In 2019, Credit One sold Deiker’s debt to LVNV Funding, 
<line: 16> LLC. Id. ¶¶ 12–13. LVNV then placed the debt with TrueAccord for collection. Id. 
<line: 17> ¶ 14. During TrueAccord’s collection efforts in 2019, TrueAccord sent Deiker emails 
<line: 18> that included the following paragraph: 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> The remaining balance owed to LVNV Funding LLC is $1,013.63. The balance 
<line: 21> breakdown is as follows: $1,013.63 in principal (which may include interest 
<line: 22> and fees accrued prior to purchase), $0.00 in fees since purchase, $0.00 in 
<line: 23> interest since purchase, and $0.00 in administrative costs since pur-
<line: 24> chase.   

[TEXT]
<line: 26> Id. ¶ 16 (emphasis in original). Deiker filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against 
<line: 27> TrueAccord alleging that the text of the email violated Sections 1692e and 1692f of 
<line: 28> the FDCPA. Id. ¶¶ 46–47, 49–50. First, Deiker alleges this paragraph is false and 
<line: 29> misleading because it implies—by listing fees and administrative costs as catego-
<line: 30> ries—that TrueAccord can charge Deiker fees and administrative costs when in real-
<line: 31> ity those charges cannot “be legally or contractually assessed.” Id. ¶¶ 46–47. Second, 
<line: 32> Deiker alleges that the language created a “false sense of urgency” for Deiker to repay

<line: 4> the debt lest he incur fees and administrative costs, thus amounting to "unfair and
<line: 5> unconscionable means' of collecting debt. Id.  49-50.

[TEXT]
<line: 7> TrueAccord now moves for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the emails
<line: 8> do not violate Sections 1692e and 1692f of the FDCPA because they are neither mis-
<line: 9> leading nor unconscionable. Mot. J. Pleadings at 4. As forecast in the introduction,
<line: 10> however, the threshold issue is Article III standing.

[TITLE]
<line: 12> II. Legal Standard

[TEXT]
<line: 14> "Subject-matter jurisdiction is the first issue in any case." Miller v. Southwest
<line: 15> Airlines Co., 926 F.3d 898, 902 (7th Cir. 2019). The plaintiff bears the burden of es-
<line: 16> tablishing subject matter jurisdiction, which includes Article III's requirement of
<line: 17> standing. Apex Digital, Inc. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 572 F.3d 440, 443 (7th Cir. 2009).
<line: 18> To satisfy Article III's standing requirement at the pleading stage, a plaintiff must
<line: 19> allege facts that plausibly suggest that the plaintiff suffered an injury-in-fact that is
<line: 20> fairly traceable to the conduct of the defendant and can be redressed by a favorable
<line: 21> decision. Larkin v. Finance Sys. of Green Bay, Inc., 982 F.3d 1060, 1064 (7th Cir.
<line: 22> 2020) (citing Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016)); Bazile v. Finance
<line: 23> Sys. of Green Bay, Inc., 983 F.3d 274, 278 (7th Cir. 2020). An injury-in-fact must be
<line: 24> both concrete and particularized. Spokeo, 136 S.Ct at 1548. A "bare procedural viola-
<line: 25> tion, divorced from any concrete harm' does not satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement

<line: 7> III. Analysis 

[TITLE]
<line: 9> A. Confusion is Inadequate as Injury-in-Fact 

[TEXT]
<line: 11> The parties do not address whether Deiker has sufficiently alleged Article III 
<line: 12> standing. But “standing is jurisdictional and cannot be waived.” Nettles v. Midland 
<line: 13> Funding LLC, 983 F.3d 896, 899 (7th Cir. 2020). And recent Seventh Circuit case law 
<line: 14> calls into grave doubt whether the Complaint adequately alleges standing. It appears 
<line: 15> that the sole injury that Deiker alleges in his pleadings is that TrueAccord’s emails 
<line: 16> led him “to believe that fees and administrative costs would begin accruing if he did 
<line: 17> not promptly pay the subject debt.” Compl. ¶ 21. The problem with this allegation is 
<line: 18> that, given recent Seventh Circuit case law, the allegation does not link Deiker’s be-
<line: 19> liefs and confusion to the type of concrete injury needed for an injury-in-fact.  

[TEXT]
<line: 21> In Markakos v. Medicredit, Inc., a debt collector sent the debtor a letter mis-
<line: 22> representing the amount of the debt that was owed. 997 F.3d 778, 779 (7th Cir. 2021). 
<line: 23> The debtor alleged that this letter “confused and aggravated” her and violated Section 
<line: 24> 1692g of the FDCPA, which requires debt collectors to notify debtors of their debt 
<line: 25> amounts. Id. at 780–81. The Seventh Circuit held that the plaintiff did not sufficiently 
<line: 26> allege Article III standing because “grievances are not injuries in fact in this context” 
<line: 27> and a “state of confusion is not itself an injury.” Id. at 781 (cleaned up); see also

[TEXT]
<line: 4> Larkin, 982 F.3d at 1066 (emphasis added) (holding that injury-in-fact requires the 
<line: 5> plaintiff to allege that they were “confused or misled to their detriment … or other-
<line: 6> wise relied to their detriment on the contents of the letters”) (emphases added). 
<line: 7> Markakos also explained that, in order to establish standing, the plaintiff would have 
<line: 8> needed to allege that the FDCPA violation led to a concrete injury, such as “pay[ing] 
<line: 9> extra money, affect[ing] a plaintiff’s credit, or otherwise alter[ing] a plaintiff’s re-
<line: 10> sponse to a debt.” Id. at 780. Similarly, in Gunn v. Thrasher, Buschmann & Voelkel, 
<line: 11> P.C., the plaintiffs alleged that a collection letter issued by a law firm was false and 
<line: 12> misleading because the law firm “would have found it too costly to pursue foreclosure 
<line: 13> to collect a $2,000 debt.” 982 F.3d 1069, 1070 (7th Cir. 2020). The Seventh Circuit 
<line: 14> held that the plaintiffs did not establish Article III standing because they only as-
<line: 15> serted that they were “annoyed or intimidated by the letter,” and alleged no concrete 
<line: 16> harm. Id. at 1071–72. 

[TEXT]
<line: 18> Like the plaintiffs in Markakos and Gunn, Deiker only alleges that he “be-
<line: 19> lieve[d]” fees and costs would accrue if he did not pay his debt promptly. Compl. ¶ 21. 
<line: 20> The Complaint is devoid of any allegation that Deiker actually did anything different 
<line: 21> in response to the emails, such as made a payment sooner than he otherwise would 
<line: 22> have had he not received the emails. Rather, Deiker only alleges that the emails cre-
<line: 23> ated a feeling of confusion and intimidation, which does not amount to a concrete 
<line: 24> injury in FDCPA actions. See Markakos, 997 F.3d at 781; Gunn, 982 F.3d at 1071; see 
<line: 25> also Nettles, 983 F.3d at 900 (holding that a plaintiff who becomes annoyed does not 
<line: 26> “establish injury for standing purposes”). Because Deiker does not allege a concrete

<line: 4> harm particular to him in his pleadings, there is serious doubt that the current Com-
<line: 5> plaint sufficiently alleges Article III standing. 

[TEXT]
<line: 7> Having said that, the Court will allow the parties to file position papers ad-
<line: 8> dressing whether Deiker’s current allegations sufficiently allege an injury-in-fact be-
<line: 9> fore. If the position papers reveal that the current Complaint is sufficient in estab-
<line: 10> lishing standing (which would be surprising), then TrueAccord may refile its motion 
<line: 11> for judgment on the pleadings. But if the position papers fail to demonstrate that 
<line: 12> Deiker has standing to sue (or the parties concede it), then Deiker can ask for leave 
<line: 13> to amend the complaint. The position papers are due by October 18, 2021.  

[TITLE]
<line: 15> B. Guidance on Injury-in-Fact 

[TEXT]
<line: 17> The Court offers two preliminary thoughts on what allegations might be suffi-
<line: 18> cient to assert Article III standing in the wake of recent Seventh Circuit precedent 
<line: 19> addressing standing in FDCPA suits.  

[TEXT]
<line: 21> Consulting an Attorney. Consulting with an attorney in response to a debt col-
<line: 22> lection notice does not in itself establish Article III standing. See Nettles, 983 F.3d at 
<line: 23> 900. In Nettles, the plaintiff alleged that a debt collector violated Sections 1692e and 
<line: 24> 1692f of the FDCPA after receiving a collection letter that misrepresented her total 
<line: 25> debt owed. Id. at 898. But the only harm that the plaintiff alleged was “becoming 
<line: 26> annoyed and consulting a lawyer.” Id. at 900. The Seventh Circuit held that these 
<line: 27> allegations—including consulting the lawyer—were insufficient to meet the injury-
<line: 28> in-fact requirement of Article III standing. Id.; see also Brunett v. Convergent Out-
<line: 29> sourcing, Inc., 982 F.3d 1067, 1068–69 (7th Cir. 2020) (holding that a plaintiff who

[TEXT]
<line: 4> alleged a debt collector’s letter confused and intimidated her did not establish stand-
<line: 5> ing because the plaintiff failed to “tie” her feelings to a concrete injury—even though 
<line: 6> she hired an attorney). Thus, even if a debt-collector communication violates the 
<line: 7> FDCPA in some way, consulting an attorney does not in and of itself establish an 
<line: 8> injury-in-fact without further allegations of concrete harm. The Seventh Circuit has 
<line: 9> reasoned that if consulting an attorney were enough, then every represented plaintiff 
<line: 10> by definition would have standing to sue, which cannot be right. See Brunett, 982 
<line: 11> F.3d at 1069 (“Many people think that an advisory opinion will set their minds at 
<line: 12> ease, but hiring a lawyer in quest of a judicial answer does not permit a federal court, 
<line: 13> operating under Article III, to give that answer”). Suffering a “state of confusion is 
<line: 14> not itself an injury” and “[a] desire to obtain legal advice is not a reason for universal 
<line: 15> standing.” Brunett, 982 F.3d at 1068–69.  

[TEXT]
<line: 17> It might make a difference, however, if a plaintiff is reasonably confused by an 
<line: 18> actually false statement and pays a lawyer to address that statement.3 In this 

[ABANDON]
<line: 20> 3The Seventh Circuit has not explicitly commented on whether paying a lawyer to 
<line: 21> address an actually false and misleading letter that confused a debtor can establish Article 
<line: 22> III standing. In Brunett, the Seventh Circuit explained that the plaintiff’s “confusion led her 
<line: 23> to hire a lawyer does not change the evaluation [of Article III standing].” 982 F.3d at 1069 
<line: 24> (emphasis added). Similarly, in Nettles, the Seventh Circuit held that “becoming annoyed and 
<line: 25> consulting a lawyer” does not establish Article III standing. 983 F.3d at 900 (emphasis 
<line: 26> added). But it is not clear, however, that the plaintiffs in Brunett or Nettles actually paid 
<line: 27> their attorneys, as distinct from hiring the lawyer on a contingency-fee basis. The opinions 
<line: 28> do not mention the payment of attorney’s fees. Nor does a review of the oral arguments of 
<line: 29> these cases reveal an assertion of actual payment of fees. See Oral Argument, Brunett, 982 
<line: 30> F.3d 1067 (7th Cir. 2020) (No. 19-3256), http://media.ca7. uscourts.gov/sound/2020/cm.19-

<line: 4> scenario, a plaintiff might very well have suffered a concrete harm caused by a viola-
<line: 5> tion of the FDCPA and thus satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III stand-
<line: 6> ing. Consider, for example, a letter that falsely states that if a debtor does not pay the 
<line: 7> debt by a certain deadline, the debt collector will file a complaint with the local police 
<line: 8> and ask them to seek an arrest warrant. If the debtor is reasonably misled by this 
<line: 9> letter and pays $500 to a criminal defense attorney to address the situation, arguably 
<line: 10> the debtor suffered a concrete and particularized harm that satisfies the injury-in-
<line: 11> fact requirement of Article III standing. That type of retention of a lawyer, coupled 
<line: 12> with payment of a fee, is arguably different from hiring a lawyer on a contingency-fee 
<line: 13> basis to bring an FDCPA lawsuit. (Here, Deiker does not allege that he paid a lawyer 
<line: 14> to address his confusion. Compl. ¶¶ 18–19, 21–22.) 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> “Appreciable Risk of Harm.” To meet the injury-in-fact requirement of Article 
<line: 17> III standing, a statutory violation need not tangibly harm a plaintiff; a plaintiff can 
<line: 18> successfully assert Article III standing if a statutory violation “presented an appre-
<line: 19> ciable risk of harm to the underlying concrete interest that Congress sought to pro-
<line: 20> tect.” Casillas, 926 F.3d at 333 (cleaned up). In Evans v. Portfolio Recovery Associates, 
<line: 21> LLC, the plaintiffs alleged that a debt collector violated Section 1692e of the FDCPA 
<line: 22> by failing to notify credit-reporting agencies that the plaintiffs disputed their debts. 
<line: 23> 889 F.3d 337, 343 (7th Cir. 2018). The Seventh Circuit held that the plaintiffs suffi-
<line: 24> ciently alleged an injury-in-fact because the plaintiffs suffered a “real risk of financial 
<line: 25> harm caused by an inaccurate credit rating.” Id. at 345 (cleaned up). In contrast, in 
<line: 26> Larkin, the plaintiffs received collection letters that they alleged were in violation of

[TEXT]
<line: 4> Sections 1692e and 1692f of the FDCPA. 982 F.3d at 1062. The Seventh Circuit held 
<line: 5> that because the plaintiffs’ complaints did not contain “any allegation of harm … or 
<line: 6> even an appreciable risk of harm,” the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue. Id. at 1066–
<line: 7> 67 (emphasis in original). Larkin set out examples of allegations that the plaintiffs 
<line: 8> could have advanced to satisfy Article III standing, such as alleging that the debt 
<line: 9> collector’s communication created an appreciable risk that the plaintiffs would pay 
<line: 10> debts they did not owe. Id. at 1066. It is clear from Larkin and Evans that to satisfy 
<line: 11> the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III standing, an appreciable risk of harm 
<line: 12> must be alleged rather than an appreciable risk of confusion. Again, here, Deiker does 
<line: 13> not allege that he suffered an appreciable risk of harm, such as the possibility that a 
<line: 14> credit-reporting agency might act against him.   

[TITLE]
<line: 16> IV. Conclusion 

[TEXT]
<line: 18> The parties shall file position papers addressing whether Deiker has estab-
<line: 19> lished an injury-in-fact under Article III standing. If the position papers reveal that 
<line: 20> the current Complaint is sufficient in establishing standing (which would be surpris-
<line: 21> ing), then TrueAccord may refile its motion for judgment on the pleadings. The mo-
<line: 22> tion is terminated without prejudice. But if the position papers fail to demonstrate 
<line: 23> that Deiker has standing to sue (or the parties concede it), then Deiker can ask for 
<line: 24> leave to amend the complaint. The position papers are due by October 18, 2021.
