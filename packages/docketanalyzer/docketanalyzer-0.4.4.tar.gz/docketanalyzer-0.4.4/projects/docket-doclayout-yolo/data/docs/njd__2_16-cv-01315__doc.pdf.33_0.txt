<line: 8> Mr. Rodriguez and nine co-defendants were members of a local New Jersey chapter of a
<line: 9> national organization called the Latin Kings. The Orange Crush was an elite enforcement group
<line: 10> of the Latin Kings, appointed by defendant Luis Manso. a Latin Kings regional officer. Orange
<line: 11> Crush handled special problems of Latin Kings members. Rodrigues, 2015 WL 5038103, at *1.
<line: 12> (DE 10-2 at 9.)

[TEXT]
<line: 14> According to defendant David Martinez. defendant Michael Romero held a Latin Kings
<line: 15> member meeting at his Jersey City home on June 29. 1998. He explained that. the day before.
<line: 16> Omar D. Morante (Omar D") and Jimmy Cabrera had conducted a drive-by shooting at his
<line: 17> apartment complex. Mr. Romero believed that he had been the shooting's intended target. He
<line: 18> wanted the Latin Kings to retaliate on his behalf. Defendant Charles Byrd. who attended the
<line: 19> meeting. agreed. He ordered Orange Crush to kidnap Omar D and Jimmy Cabrera that night
<line: 20> break their shooting arms, and then kill them. Rodriguez. 2015 WL 5038103, at *1.

<line: 7> phones at the interchange to call Charles Byrd and confirm that their orders were to carry out the
<line: 8> punishment without a *trial." According to David Martinez, while Luis Manso was speaking to
<line: 9> Charles Byrd, Jesus Rodriguez asked to speak to Charles Byrd to persuade him that a *trial" was
<line: 10> necessary, but Luis Manso told him that Charles Byrd refused to reconsider the issue. According
<line: 11> to Juan DeJesus, when Luis Manso hung up the phone, he said: *[Byrd] said we got to do this."

<line: 5> B. Procedural History

[TEXT]
<line: 7> In November 1998, Mr. Rodriguez and his nine co-defendants were indicted and charged
<line: 8> in eighteen counts with six different crimes against four victims, two of whom were killed. They
<line: 9> were all charged with four counts of second-degree conspiracy to commit kidnapping: four
<line: 10> counts of first-degree kidnapping; four counts of second-degree conspiracy to commit murder;
<line: 11> two counts of murder; two counts of felony murder; and two counts of attempted murder. Edwin
<line: 12> Diaz, who was also charged with additional counts, Ricardo Diaz, David Martinez, Sfand
<line: 13> Rajabzaden, Edwin Rivera, and Miguel Torres pled guilty. The trial judge denied motions for
<line: 14> separate trials. Id. at * I.

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Mr. Rodriguez and co-defendants Luis Manso, Michael Romero. Jose Antonio Perez, and!
<line: 17> Charles Byrd were tried jointly between January 24 and March 17. 2000. Idl. Mr. Rodriguez was
<line: 18> sentenced on April 26, 2000 and received two consecutive life sentences for the murder
<line: 19> convictions, eighty-five percent without parole; four concurrent life sentences for the kidnapping.
<line: 20> convictions, eighty-five percent without parole; and concurrent fifty-year sentences for the
<line: 21> attempted murder convictions. The remaining convictions merged. (DE 10-2 at 7.) Mr.
<line: 22> Rodriguez and the co-defendants who were tried with him appealed. In an unpublished opinion,
<line: 23> the Appellate Division affirmed the convictions.State r. Romero, Nos. A-4974 99, A--6593-99.

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Mr. Rodriguez filed his PCR petition in March 2005. He raised issues primarily related to
<line: 3> allegations of constitutionally ineffective assistance of trial, appellate. and PCR counsel. as well
<line: 4> as trial errors not raised on direct appeal. See Rodriguez, 2015 wL 5038103. at *2..

[TEXT]
<line: 6> The PCR judge held an evidentiary hearing on Mr. Rodriguez's PCR petition, as well as
<line: 7> those filed by Mr. Manso, Mr. Romero, and Mr. Perez. Rodriguez, 2015 WL 5038103, at *3. In a
<line: 8> written decision and order dated January 7, 2013, the PCR judge denied relief and dismissed Mr.
<line: 9> Rodriguez's petition. (DE 10-6.) He reached the same result with respect to the petitions filed by
<line: 10> the other three defendants. (Id.) Rodriguez, 2015 WL 5038103, at *3..

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Mr. Rodriguez appealed the denial of PCR, raising seven issues, including his trial
<line: 13> attorney's IAC for "fail[ure] to attend or procure replacement counsel for all jury selection.
<line: 14> proceedings." (DE 10-5 at 3.) In his pro se supplemental brief. Mr. Rodriguez argued that trial
<line: 15> counse! rendered lAC by "fail[ing] to advise [Petitioner] on whether or not to testify, to inform
<line: 16> him that the choice whether to testify was ultimately his to make, and to honor [Petitioner's]
<line: 17> wish to testify." (DE 10-6 at 3.) In a second pro se supplemental brief. Mr. Rodriguez again
<line: 18> argued IAC by trial counsel's failure to inform him of his right to testify, which prejudiced him.

<line: 22> denial of PCR. Rodrigues, 2015 WL 5038103, at *5-10.

[TEXT]
<line: 24> On March 3, 2016, Mr. Rodriguez filed his $ 2254 Petition with this Court. (DE 1 at 17.)

<line: 26> He raises four grounds-for relief: (1) ineffective assistance of counsel ("IAC) by his trial.

[ABANDON]
<line: 28> 2
<line: 29> With respect to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel (*lAC") by his trial counsel, Paul.
<line: 30> Feinberg, Esquire, Mr. Rodriguez argued that Feinberg: failed to request severance of Mr. Rodriguez's
<line: 31> case from those of his co-defendants; failed to object to the State's systematic elimination of Hispanics
<line: 32> from the jury; failed to be present at all times during jury selection; failed to adequately investigate the
<line: 33> case; failed to request a hearing on Mr. Rodriguez's minor status; and made "serious omissions and.
<line: 34> derelictions of duty."(DE 10-6 a1 77-78.).

<line: 2> attorney in failing to advise Mr. Rodriguez of his right to testify at trial (DE I at 23): (2) IAC by
<line: 3> trial counsel in failing to be present for three days during jury selection (id. at 25): (3) violation
<line: 4> of Mr. Rodriguez's due process rights when *a juror who had been intimidated by outsiders was
<line: 5> allowed to remain on the jury" (id. at 26); and (4) unconstitutional exclusion of Hispanics from
<line: 6> the venire or the jury as seated. (Id. at 27.)

<line: 12> LEGAL STANDARDS

[TEXT]
<line: 14> Under 28 U.S.C.  2254(a), the district court *shall entertain an application for a writ of
<line: 15> habeas corpus [o]n behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court only
<line: 16> on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the
<line: 17> United States." A habeas petitioner has the burden of establishing his entitlement to relief for
<line: 18> each claim presented in his petition based upon the record that was before the state court. See
<line: 19> Eley r. Erickson, 712 F.3d 837, 846 (3d Cir. 2013): see also Parker r. Mutthews, 567 U.S. 37.
<line: 20> 40-41 (2012). District courts are required to give great deference to the determinations of the
<line: 21> state trial and appellate courts. See Renico r. Lelt. 559 U.S. 766. 773 (2010).

[TEXT]
<line: 23> In general, a federal court may not grant a writ of habeas corpus under $ 2254 unless the
<line: 24> petitioner has "exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State." 28 U.S.C. $
<line: 25> 2254(b)(l)(A). To do so, a petitioner must * fairly present' all federal clains to the highest state
<line: 26> court before bringing them in federal court." Leyva v. Iilliams, 504 F.3d 357, 365 (3d Cir. 2007)
<line: 27> (citing Stevens v. Delavare Corr. Ctr., 295 F.3d 361, 369 (3d Cir. 2002)). This requirement
<line: 28> ensures that state courts *have *an initial opportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations
<line: 29> of prisoners' federal rights.'" Id. (citing United States v. Bendolph. 409 F.3d 155, 173 (3d Cir.

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> 2005) (quoting Duckvorth . Serrano, 454 U.S. 1, 3 (1981)). Even if a petitioner's constitutional
<line: 3> claims are unexhausted, however, a habeas court has the discretion to deny them on the merits
<line: 4> under 28 U.S.C. $ 2254(b)(2). See Taylor r. Horn, 504 F.3d 416. 427 (3d Cir. 2007); Bronshtein
<line: 5> v. Horn, 404 F.3d 700, 728 (3d Cir. 2005).

[TEXT]
<line: 7> Where a claim has been adjudicated on the merits by the state courts, the district court
<line: 8> shall not grant an application for a writ of habeas corpus unless that state court adjudication

[TEXT]
<line: 10> (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an
<line: 11> unreasonable application of. clearly established Federal law, as.
<line: 12> determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or

[TEXT]
<line: 14> (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable

<line: 16> State court proceeding.

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 28 U.S.C. $ 2254(d)(1)-(2). Federal law is clearly established for these purposes where it is
<line: 19> clearly expressed in **only the holdings, as opposed to the dicta" of the opinions of the United
<line: 20> States Supreme Court. See Iloods r. Donald. 135 S. Ct. 1372. 1376 (2015). "When reviewing
<line: 21> state criminal convictions on collateral review, federal judges are required to afford state courts
<line: 22> due respect by overturning their decisions only when there could be no reasonable dispute that
<line: 23> they were wrong.' Id. Where a petitioner challenges an allegedly erroneous factual determination
<line: 24> of the state courts, *"a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to
<line: 25> be correct [and the] applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness
<line: 26> by clear and convincing evidence." 28 U.S.C. $ 2254(e)(1).

[TEXT]
<line: 28>  For any particular issue, the relevant state court decision for purposes of federal habeas
<line: 29> review is the last reasoned state court decision. See Bondd r. Beard, 539 F.3d 256, 289-90 (3d Cir
<line: 30> 2008). These deferentia! standards apply, however, *even where there has been a summary.
<line: 31> denial" by the state court. Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 187 (2011). "In these.

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> circumstances, [petitioner] can satisfy the *unreasonable application* prong of $ 2254(d)(1) only
<line: 3> by showing that 'there was no reasonable basis' for the [state court's] decision." Id. at 187-88
<line: 4> (quoting Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 98 (2011)). Furthermore, "when the relevant state-
<line: 5> court decision on the merits ...does not come accompanied with .. reasons... [w]e hold that the
<line: 6> federal court should -look through' the unexplained decision to the last related state-court
<line: 7> decision that does provide a relevant rationale." 1/ilson v. Sellers, 138 S. Ct. 1188. 1192 (2018).

[TEXT]
<line: 9> Because many of the claims sound in IAC, I review the governing standards briefly. In
<line: 10> Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 688 (1984). the U.S. Supreme Court held that a claim of
<line: 11>  ineffective assistance of counsel claim has two essential elements.

[TEXT]
<line: 13> First, the petitioner must show that counsel's performance fell below an objective
<line: 14> standard of reasonableness. See 466 U.S. at 688; see also Ross r. Iarano, 712 F.3d 784, 798 (3d
<line: 15> Cir. 2013). To do so, the petitioner must identify particular acts or omissions that were not the
<line: 16> result of reasonable professional judgment. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690. The federal court
<line: 17> must determine whether, in light of all of the circumstances. the identified acts or omissions fell
<line: 18> outside the wide range of professional competent assistance. See id.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Second, the petitioner must affirmatively demonstrate prejudice. "Prejudice" means that
<line: 21> "there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional crrors. the result of the
<line: 22> proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to
<line: 23> undermine confidence in the outcome." See id. at 694; see also McBride r. Superintendent, SCI
<line: 24> Houzdale, 687 F.3d 92, 102 n. 11 (3d Cir. 2012). *With respect to the sequence of the two
<line: 25> prongs, the Strickland Court held that 'a court need not determine whether counsel's
<line: 26> performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result
<line: 27> of the alleged deficiencies .. If it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will ofien be so, that course should be followed."
<line: 3> Rainey v. V/arner, 603 F.3d 189. 201 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Stricklund, 466 U.S. at 697).

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Finally, on habeas review, it is not enough that a federal judge would have found counse!
<line: 6> ineffective. The judge must find that the state court's resolution of the IAC issue itself was
<line: 7>  unreasonable, a higher standard:

[TEXT]
<line: 9> The pivotal question is whether the state court's application of the
<line: 10> Strickland standard was unreasonable. This is different from asking
<line: 11> whether defense counsel's performance fell below Stricklad's
<line: 12> standard. Were that the inquiry, the analysis would be no different
<line: 13> than if, for example. this Court were adjudicating a Strickland claim
<line: 14> on direct review of a criminal conviction in a United States district
<line: 15> court. Under AEDPA, though, it is a necessary premise that the two
<line: 16> questions are different. For purposes of s 2254(d)(t). an
<line: 17> wreasonable application of federal law is different from an
<line: 18> incorrecl application of federal law. A state court must be granted a
<line: 19> deference and latitude that are not in operation when the case
<line: 20> involves review under the Strickladd standard itself.

[TEXT]
<line: 28> A. Ground One: Ineffective Assistance of Counsel By Failing To Advise Petitioner
<line: 29> Of His Right To Testify At Trial

[TEXT]
<line: 31> Mr. Rodriguez alleges that his trial counsel. Mr. Feinberg. rendered IAC by "not
<line: 32> advis[ing] Petitioner of his right to testify, nor that the choice whether to testify was ultimately
<line: 33> his to make." (DE 1 at 23 ("IAC-Testify Claim").) In light of the record before me and
<line: 34> governing federal law, for the reasons stated below, I lind that (1) the state court rejection of the
<line: 35> IAC-Testify Claim was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of Strickland; and (2)
<line: 36> that Mr. Rodriguez has made no showing of prejudice, i.e., a specific profler of genuinely
<line: 37> exculpatory testimony that would have enhanced his chances of acquittal.

<line: 2> (1) State court ruling on IAC-Testify claim.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> The last reasoned decision on Mr. Rodriguez's IAC-Testify Claim was that of the
<line: 5> Appellate Division on appeal from the denial of PCR. See Rodrigues, 2015 WL 5038103, at *1.
<line: 6> The Appellate Division *reach[ed] the merits" of, and rejected, the IAC-Testify Claim on Mr.
<line: 7> Rodriguez's appeal from the denial of PCR. Rodriguez. 2015 WL 5038103, at *8.

[TEXT]
<line: 9> The Appellate Division's decision correctly set forth the governing law, including (1) a
<line: 10> criminal defendant's constitutional right to testify and (2) defense counsel's responsibility to
<line: 11> advise his client on whether or not to testify, with explanation of"the tactical advantages and
<line: 12> disadvantages of doing so or of not doing so." Rodrigues, 2015 WL 5038103, at *8 (internal
<line: 13> citations omitted).

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Next, the Appellate Division considered pertinent parts of the record, summarizing them.
<line: 16> as foilows:

[TEXT]
<line: 18> [Mr.] Feinberg testified at the hearing that he "always talk[ed] to
<line: 19> the defendant about the right to testify," and that his "standard
<line: 20> practice [was] to continue talking during the course of the case to
<line: 21> see whether they want to testify." He added that, at the end of the
<line: 22> State's case, he *typically [sat] down with the client and go over
<line: 23> that." However, he had no independent recollection of doing so

<line: 2> On the Strickland prejudice prong, the state courts considered Mr. Rodriguez's claims.
<line: 3> that (1) he would have testified at trial that his part in the crimes was minimal and due to duress.
<line: 4> (2) he played no part in the pre-murder meeting. (3) he thought the murder victims were being
<line: 5> taken to the park for only a light assault, and (4) he tried unsuccessfully to stop the murders. The

<line: 8> admission that he had some involvement with the Latin Kings and participated to some degree in
<line: 9> the events of June 29, 1998, would have "opened him up to considerable cross-examination and
<line: 10> would most likely have been counterproductive." Id. For these reasons, the Appellate Division

<line: 22> counsel called Mr. Rodriguez's trial counsel, Mr. Feinberg. as a witness. (DE 17-1 at 91). Mr.
<line: 23> Paul asked trial counsel whether he recalled discussing with Mr. Rodriguez his rightto testify at
<line: 24> trial. (DE 17-1 at 94-95.) Trial counsel replied that althougli he had "no independent recollection
<line: 25> of that, it was his "standard practicc to do it. (Id. at 95 ("I can't say that I have any memory in

<line: 8> time to put our case on, I typically sit down with the client to go.

<line: 19> (DE 17-1 at 104-05.) Mr. Rodriguez did not testify at the hearing.3

[TEXT]
<line: 21> The only evidence of record, then, that was before the Appellate Division at the time it
<line: 22> rejected the IAC-Testify Claim, was that Trial counsel believed he had informed Mr. Rodriguez.
<line: 23> of his right to testify at trial in accord with his invariable practice. The state court was entitled to
<line: 24> credit counsel's on-the-record representations. The state court's finding that the deficient-
<line: 25> performance prong was not satisfied by those facts was a reasonable application of Strickland.

[TITLE]
<line: 27> (3) Lack of prejudice

[TEXT]
<line: 29> Mr. Rodriguez also has failed to demonstrate prejudice from the alleged error. That is, he
<line: 30> does not specifically point to facts suggesting that he would have offered exculpatory testimony
<line: 31> that had a reasonable probability of altering the result.

[ABANDON]
<line: 33> Mr. Rodriguez, who was represented both at trial and in the PCR proceedings, did not testify to
<line: 34> the contrary, nor did he provide to the state courts any evidence that contradicted his Trial counsel's
<line: 35> sworn testimony. Factually, his claim that counsel failed to advise him rested solely on unsupported
<line: 36> contentions in his supplemental appellate pro se briefs in connection with PCR. (DE 10-6 at 13-14; DE
<line: 37> 10-7 at 15-16.) The lirst time that Mr. Rodriguez ever made these contentions in sworn form was in this
<line: 38> habeas matter, in his February 15, 2017 Declaration In Support Of His Motion For An Evidentiary
<line: 39> Hearing ("Declaration"). (DE 27-2 at 1 (*Trial counsel failed to advise me about my right to testify").)
<line: 40> Neither that Declaration nor anything equivalent was before the state courts. The presumption that this
<line: 41> Court, on habeas review, must defer to reasonable state court fact finding is not overcome.

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Of course, every defendant has a right to testily, and an equal and opposite right not to.
<line: 3> Iestify. He cannot do one without waiving the other. See generally United States v. Penycooke.
<line: 4> 65 F.3d 9, 11 (3d Cir. 1995). In any case, therefore, a convicted defendant who has opted for one.
<line: 5> alternative may base a claim on having foregone the other. It is perhaps for this reason that in
<line: 6> such cases, the courts have required a somewhat specific statement of how the delendant's.
<line: 7> testimony might have changed the result..

[TEXT]
<line: 9> Thus, for example, in Palmer r. Hendricks, 592 F.3d 386 (3d Cir. 2010), the Court of
<line: 10> Appeals considered a similar claim of IAC. but found no prejudice. That petitioner stated that he.
<line: 11> had wished to assert a theory of self-defense. one which would have relied on his testifying to his
<line: 12> version of the events. Still, said the court, Palmer had revealed nothing specific "about the facts
<line: 13> to which Palmer would have testified." Id. at 395 (the petition "containfed] no factual matter
<line: 14> regarding Stricklad's prejudice prong'). It was not cnough. said the Court of Appeals. that the
<line: 15> petitioner claimed to have acted in self-defense and wanted to *tell his side of the story." Id..
<line: 16> Without further specificity. the petitioner had not met his burden to demonstrate an enhanced
<line: 17> likelihood of acquittal, in the sense that the testimony would have been "genuinely exculpatory.'
<line: 18> Id. at 395-96. It upheld the denial of the habeas petition without a hearing..

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Mr. Rodriguez's IAC-Testify Clain suffers the same shortcomings. He expresses very
<line: 21> little beyond a generalized desire to tell his side of the story. He is not specific about what his
<line: 22> testimony would have consisted of, but posits that it would have "refuted' the State's case:

<line: 29> rejected the petitioner's argument that even in the absence of a factual showing of prejudice, counsel's

<line: 5> prior to trial. And also by the testimony of Juan DeJesus, a state witness. It cannot
<line: 6> be emphasized enough that Petitioner's testimony was crucial for his defense
<line: 7> because it refutes all evidence presented against him by the State.

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Mr. Rodriguez alleges that his trial counsel, Mr. Feinberg. rendered IAC by "fail[ing] to
<line: 6> attend sessions of jury selection for three days due to his hospitalization following a heart attack.
<line: 7> Trial counsel failed to arrange substitute counsel for [Pletitioner." (DE 1 at 25 (*IAC-Jury

<line: 9> objections to under-representation of Hispanics on the jury (id.). a claim that is discussed
<line: 10> substantively at Section IV.C, infra.

[TEXT]
<line: 12> The trial record confirms that Mr. Feinberg was indeed absent for three days at the outset
<line: 13> of the jury selection process: January 24, 26, and 27, 2000. See Rodrigues. 2015 WL 5038103, at
<line: 14> *6. What went on in those three days. however, was not "jury selection' in the sense of roir dire.

<line: 16> three days the trial judge accommodated trial counsel's absence by confining the proceedings to
<line: 17> the distribution and collection of questionnaires. and the grant or denial of hardship excuses. The
<line: 18> record reveals the following:

[TEXT]
<line: 20> On January 24. 2000, the trial judge instructed a group of potential jurors on the jury
<line: 21> selection process and gave a brief overview of the case. In explaining Mr. Feinberg's absence.
<line: 22> the judge told the jury panel:.

<line: 24> We have had a minor illness of one of our attorneys. and so I am.

<line: 23> that was solely designed to eliminate *hardship cases" through the
<line: 24> inspection of the submitted questionnaires. The testimony of Mr.

<line: 30> 121, 1004 S. Ct. 453, 457 (1983), a juror answered during voir dire that she had no prior knowledge of
<line: 31> facts relevant to the case. The evidence, however, jogged her memory; when an uncharged murder was
<line: 32> introduced in evidence, she realized that the victim had been a childhood friend. During trial, the juror
<line: 33> went to the judge's chambers and, ex parte, informed him that her voir dire answers had been inaccurate
<line: 34> She stated to the judge that her deliberations would not be biased by that knowledge. The encounter was

<line: 38> prejudice. The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed, and subjected this claim to the usual  2254(d) deference

<line: 9> precedents. In distinguishing McCombs, the state court did not unreasonably apply U.S. Supreme.
<line: 10> Court precedent. In McCombs, defense counsel had been excused before trial and was absent for
<line: 11> the entire voir dire process of jury selection. The New Jersey Supreme Court emphasized that
<line: 12> what is "critical" about the critical stage is the selection of an impartial jury, through the process.
<line: 13> of voir dire questioning (even if done by the judge). In distinguishing McCombs and finding that.
<line: 14> counsel's absence did not impair the selection of an impartial jury, the state court here did not
<line: 15> run afoul of Sixth Amendment standards or Supreme Court case law. And "[w]here the ' "precise.

<line: 9> in that selection was underway. But the judge discussed and rejected the challenge on the merits.
<line: 10> explaining that the Essex County's array selection process had previous!y withstood

<line: 15> On direct appeal, Mr. Rodriguez asserted the jury-array component of his claim, but the.

<line: 20> Hispanics." (DE 10-2 at 43.) The Appellate Division rejected Mr. Romero's claim, citing prior

[TEXT]
<line: 7> On direct appeal, Mr. Rodriguez argued that his trial counsel's "acceptance of the jury.
<line: 8> panel as satisfactory and [counsel's] failure to exhaust defendant's peremptory challenges
<line: 9> deprived him of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, because the issue was

<line: 17> failing to pursue a challenge. (Id. at 45-46.) The Appellate Division rejected his claim, lirst
<line: 18> correctly summarizing the governing law under Batson, suprar:.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> An impartial jury does not reguire the systematic inclusion of

<line: 30> exercised its peremplory challenges on permissible grounds. Once
<line: 31> defendant has made a timely challenge to the prosecution's use of

<line: 17> In so ruling, the Appellate Division referred favorably to the trial judge's finding that the

<line: 19> peremptory challenges -- i.e., a substantial likelihood that the peremptory challenges were based!
<line: 20> on assumptions of group bias rather than bias specific to that juror. (Idl. at 48.) This suggests that
<line: 21> counsel's failure to prevail on the Batson claim did not result from deficient performance, and in
<line: 22> any event was not prejudicial, because the claim had no reasonable probability of success. The

[TEXT]
<line: 19> Strickland's deficient-performance prong is not met. for several reasons. First. Mr.

<line: 22> to find that counsel failed to act in this regard. Third, the state courts' rulings wvere neither an
<line: 23> unreasonable application of clearly established federal law nor an unreasonable determination of
<line: 24> the facts. The trial court, faced by a challenge, followed Batson standards (citing Gilmore), and
<line: 25> made reasonable findings that no patiern of discrimination was established. See Miller-El v..
<line: 26> Dretke, 545 U.S. 231. 240 (2005) (applying presumption of correctness under s 2254(e)(1) to

<line: 10> decided it correctly. (DE 10-2 at 48.)

<line: 12> Consistent with the state court findings, and my review' of the record. I likewise conclude
<line: 13> that Mr. Rodriguez's Batson-related challenge, whether viewed substantively or as an IAC claim.
<line: 14> is meritless. The state courts applied the proper analyses. Mr. Rodriguez failed to demonstrate
<line: 15> that the peremptory challenges were exercised to exclude minority representation from the jury.
<line: 16> Nor has he now demonstrated, as required by $ 2254(d). that the actions of the state courts
<line: 17> "resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly
<line: 18> established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States," or "resulted
<line: 19> in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the

<line: 4> He stated that perhaps more juror security would be desirable. "only because I know that there
<line: 5> was a lactic that was executed upon me when I was alone." (Id.) He added: *Let's put it this way..
<line: 6> I don't like being out in that hall when we're waiting." (Id.) However, he vehemently denied that.
<line: 7> he experienced a level of discomfort or fear that would prevent him being a fair and impartial
<line: 8> juror. (Id. ("What's going on with the trial and what people are sitting here are two different
<line: 9> things, and the people that are sitting here. I don't know who they are. what their allegiance is. I
<line: 10> know nothing at all).) The judge asked again: *Do you feel you can be a fair and impartial.

<line: 21> Mr. Rodriguez and his co-defendant Mr. Romero raised the Impartial Jury Claim on.

<line: 23> governing Sixth Amendment federal law that *the accused has a constitutional right to a trial by
<line: 24> an impartial jury," which *means that a defendant is cntitled to a jury free of outside influences."
<line: 25> (DE 10-2 at 25 (internal citations omitted).) Citing state case law (which is consistent with

<line: 4> (internal citations omitted).) Applying those legal principles, the Appellate Division decided that.
<line: 5> the trial judge had "acted within her discretion' in denying the request to excuse juror thirleen.
<line: 6> The Appcllate Division explained that the record did not support the claim that juror thirteen was
<line: 7> placed in such fear that he would or had been influenced:

[TEXT]
<line: 9> [The defendant] speculates that the juror was influenced by fear to
<line: 10> find him guilty on all counts. However, influence cannot be
<line: 11> inferred merely because that was the verdict. As juror thirteen
<line: 12> made clear, he did not get any message which way the outsiders
<line: 13> might have wanted to influence him, if at all, or, as he said, what
<line: 14> their "allegiance was." The incident was without content, and was
<line: 15> related to the trial only because he recognized the people as
<line: 16> spectators. He was prompted to bring it to the attention of the
<line: 17> judge only to support additional protective measures for the jury.
<line: 18> [!]n this regard[,] no error "clearly capable of producing an unjust
<line: 19> result" occurred in this context. R. 2:10-2.

<line: 15> Here, the Appellate Division ruled that Mr. Rodriguez failed to establish any
<line: 16> unconstitutional influence on juror thirteen. That ruling was not contrary to or an unreasonable.
<line: 17> application of U.S. Supreme Court precedent, for two reasons:

[TEXT]
<line: 19> First, nothing was communicated to juror thirteen about Mr. Rodriguez's case- or so the
<line: 20> trial and appellate courts were entitled to find from the evidence. As the Appellate Division
<line: 21> correctly noted, the culprits, whoever they were, made no express statement or threat. As for any.
<line: 22> implied message, juror thirteen testified to the contrary: he *did not get auy message." he said,.
<line: 23> from the individuals who followed him on the street. (DE 10-2 at 27: emphasis added.) Those
<line: 24> individuals only *kind of laughed and joked as [if] to intimidate" him. (DE 10-2 at 23.) Juror
<line: 25> thirteen "made clear [that] he did not get any message which way the outsiders might have
<line: 26> wanted to influence him, if at all.* (Id.) The motivation, then, could have been purely
<line: 27> mischievous or malicious. (Id. at 24.) About the content of any intended or implicd message. the

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> 35

[TEXT]
<line: 2> juror expressly said he knew"nothing at all." (id. at 24) Nor could he say who the individuals
<line: 3>  were in relation to the trial, other than perhaps spectators.16

[TEXT]
<line: 5> So, as the Appellate Division succinctly concluded, *[t]he incident was without content."
<line: 6> (Id.) Mr. Rodriguez has not shown there was contact with juror thirteen about a matter pending
<line: 7> before the jury. It follows that federal precedent does not mandate a presumption of prejudice
<line: 8> with respect to the Impartial Jury Claim. The state courts' rulings were not contrary lo and did
<line: 9> not unreasonably apply United States Supreme Court precedent. At any rate, their fact finding
<line: 10> was reasonable in light of the record before them, consisting of the statements of the jurors
<line: 11> themselves.

[TEXT]
<line: 13> Second, even if there had been an error. my analysis would not be done. As the Supreme
<line: 14> Court has observed, "most" errors, even constitutiona! ones, "can be harmless." Arisona r..
<line: 15> Fulninante, 499 U.S. 279, 306 (1991). Federal courts may not grant habeas relief unless a
<line: 16> petitioner demonstrates that the alleged error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in
<line: 17> determining the jury's verdict. Brecht v. Abrahamson. 507 U.S. 619, 637 (1993). In the context
<line: 18> of this case, that means that Mr. Rodriguez would have to demonstrate that the allegedly
<line: 19> erroneous retention of juror thirteen "*actually prejudiced" him. (Id. (quoting United States r!
<line: 20> Lae. 474 U.S. 438, 449 (1986).) Based on the record before me, there is no basis for such a
<line: 21> finding.

[TEXT]
<line: 23> The trial court questioned juror thirteen individually. The juror stated that the Incident
<line: 24> would not prevent him from being fair and impartial, or affect his vote in this case. (See DE 10-2

[ABANDON]
<line: 26> 16
<line: 27> Under 28 U.S.C.  2254(d), the state court findings of fact are presumed to bc correct; and Mr.
<line: 28> Rodriguez has failed to rebut that presumption. Further, under 28 U.S.C. $ 2254(d) state court
<line: 29> conclusions of law are binding on a federal court in habeas corpus unless they resulted in a decision that
<line: 30> was "contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as
<line: 31> determined by the Supreme Courl of the United States.

<line: 2> at 23-24.) None of the surrounding circumstances compel a contrary conclusion or cast doubt on
<line: 3> the trial court's fact finding. The individuals who followed juror thirteen made no physical
<line: 4> contact or statement, regarding the trial or anything else. Juror thirteen did not even find the
<line: 5> Incident significant enough to reporl until another juror said she had been approached. (DE 10-2
<line: 6> at 23.) Juror thirteen's conduct thus conveys that his level of fear was mild, corroborating his
<line: 7> statement that he could remain impartial. The trial judge acted within his discretion in
<line: 8> concluding that juror thirteen had not been influenced and that any remaining concerns could be
<line: 9> addressed by some simple additional security measures. Mr. Rodriguez cites nothing beyond
<line: 10> "speculat[ion] that the juror was influenced by fear to find him guilty on all counts.* (DE 10-2 at
<line: 11> 27.) The state courts reasonably found otherwise. Neither untoward influence nor actual
<line: 12> prejudice can be inferred.

[TEXT]
<line: 14> Mr. Rodriguez's $ 2254 Petition expressly concedes that juror thirteen "said he could be
<line: 15> fair.* (DE 1 at 26.) Petitioner does not demonstrate with any evidence that the trial court was nol
<line: 16> entitled to credit that statement, or that the juror in fact deliberated and voted in an unfair or
<line: 17> biased manner. Petitioner thus fails to demonstrate: (1) that the state courts' decisions were
<line: 18> contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, federal precedent; or (2) actual prejudice.
