[TITLE]
<line: 15>    NOVEMBER 16, 2015 

[TEXT]
<line: 17> Plaintiff Wesley McCoy brings this civil rights action based on his conviction in state court 
<line: 18> and the suspension of his driver’s license.  For the following reasons, the Court will grant 
<line: 19> plaintiff leave to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss the complaint. 

[TITLE]
<line: 21> I. 
<line: 22> FACTS1 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Plaintiff’s license has been repeatedly suspended due to numerous traffic violations.2  
<line: 25> Plaintiff was recently convicted in state court of driving under the influence, which appears to 
<line: 26> have resulted in another term of supsension.  See Commonwealth v. McCoy, Docket No. CP-51-
<line: 27> CR-0007218-2013 (Phila. Court of Common Pleas).  The judge presiding over that case vacated 
<line: 28> her initial sentence and resentenced plaintiff to a new term of incarceration to be followed by 
<line: 29> probation.  Plaintiff alleges that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that there 
<line: 30> were other deficiencies in the proceedings.   

[TEXT]
<line: 32> Plaintiff initiated this action, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985 and 1988, against the 
<line: 33> Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Department of Motor Vehicles/PennDOT, and the PH111 

[ABANDON]
<line: 35> 1 The following facts are taken from the complaint and documents attached to the complaint. 

[ABANDON]
<line: 37> 2 Plaintiff’s history of traffic violations is recounted in a January 10, 2015 letter to plaintiff from 
<line: 38> the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, which explained to plaintiff how he could 
<line: 39> restore his driving privileges.  A copy of the letter is attached to the complaint.

<line: 4> Traffic Court.  He appears to be alleging that his constitutional rights were violated by his 
<line: 5> conviction and imprisonment, and the revocation of his license.  He also asserts negligence 
<line: 6> claims.  Plaintiff seeks $10 million in damages. 

[TITLE]
<line: 8> II. 
<line: 9> STANDARD OF REVIEW 

[TEXT]
<line: 11> The Court will grant plaintiff leave to proceed in forma pauperis because it appears that he is 
<line: 12> incapable of paying the fees necessary to commence this civil action.  Accordingly, 28 U.S.C. § 
<line: 13> 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) applies, which requires the Court to dismiss the complaint if it fails to state a 
<line: 14> claim.  Whether a complaint fails to state a claim under § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is governed by the 
<line: 15> same standard applicable to motions to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), 
<line: 16> see Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999), which requires the Court to 
<line: 17> determine whether the complaint contains “sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a 
<line: 18> claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) 
<line: 19> (quotations omitted).  As plaintiff is proceeding pro se, the Court construes his allegations 
<line: 20> liberally.  Higgs v. Att’y Gen., 655 F.3d 333, 339 (3d Cir. 2011).   

[TITLE]
<line: 22> III. 
<line: 23> DISCUSSION 

[TEXT]
<line: 25> The Eleventh Amendment precludes a private party from bringing claims against a state, or 
<line: 26> departments or agencies of a state, in federal court.  See MCI Telecomm. Corp. v. Bell Atl. Pa., 
<line: 27> 271 F.3d 491, 503 (3d Cir. 2001).  In this case, plaintiff has named as defendants the 
<line: 28> Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Department of Motor Vehicles/PennDOT, and the PH111 
<line: 29> Traffic Court.  All of those entities are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity from 
<line: 30> plaintiff’s claims.  See Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 66 (1989); Lynch v. 
<line: 31> City of Phila., 440 F. App’x 117, 119 (3d Cir. 2011); Nails v. Pa. Dep’t of Transportation, 414

<line: 4> F. App’x 452, 455 (3d Cir. 2011) (per curiam); Benn v. First Judicial Dist. of Pa., 426 F.3d 233, 
<line: 5> 241 (3d Cir. 2005).  Accordingly, plaintiff cannot state a claim against them.3 

[TITLE]
<line: 7> IV. 
<line: 8> CONCLUSION  

[TEXT]
<line: 10> For the foregoing reasons, the Court will dismiss the complaint.  Plaintiff will not be given 
<line: 11> leave to amend because amendment would be futile.  An appropriate order follows, which shall 
<line: 12> be docketed separately.  

[ABANDON]
<line: 14> 3 Furthermore, “to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or 
<line: 15> for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence 
<line: 16> invalid, a § 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct 
<line: 17> appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such 
<line: 18> determination, or called into question by a federal court’s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus[.]”  
<line: 19> Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 486-87 (1994) (footnote and citation omitted).  To the extent 
<line: 20> plaintiff is challenging convictions or imprisonment that has not been overturned or called into 
<line: 21> question, his claims are not cognizable in a civil rights action.
