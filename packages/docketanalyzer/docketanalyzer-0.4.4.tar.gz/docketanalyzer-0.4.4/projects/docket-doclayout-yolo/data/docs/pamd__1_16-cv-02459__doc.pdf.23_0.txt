<line: 26> petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (Doc. 1), wherein 
<line: 27> petitioner, Donnie Talley, alleged that the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and 
<line: 28> Parole impermissibly recalculated his maximum sentence date as March 12, 2018, 
<line: 29> and sought immediate release from custody, and this court, in an effort to ascertain 
<line: 30> the custodial status of petitioner, accessed the Vinelink online inmate locator, which 
<line: 31> revealed that petitioner has been released from custody1, and has served the 
<line: 32> maximum term of his sentence (see Doc. 22), which renders the petition moot, see 
<line: 33> DeFoy v. McCullough, 393 F.3d 439, 441 (3d Cir. 2005) (citing Lane v. Williams, 455
