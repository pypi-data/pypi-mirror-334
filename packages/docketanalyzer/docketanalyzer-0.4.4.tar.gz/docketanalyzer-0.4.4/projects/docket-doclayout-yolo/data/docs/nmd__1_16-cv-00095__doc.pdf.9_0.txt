<line: 21> ORDER FOR LIMITED MARTINEZ REPORT 

[TEXT]
<line: 23> This matter is before the Court on a letter from Plaintiff Frank Leroy Latham, in which he 
<line: 24> expresses his imminent intention to kill himself.  [Doc. 7].  Plaintiff is incarcerated, appears 
<line: 25> pro se, and is proceeding in forma pauperis.  In his letter, Plaintiff states that his “life is in 
<line: 26> danger,” he faces “death by true predators,” and rather than “get beaten to death,” he has chosen 
<line: 27> to “die by his own hands.”  Id. at 1–4.  The Court will liberally construe Plaintiff’s letter as a 
<line: 28> motion for emergency injunctive relief and order Defendants to file a Limited Martinez Report. 

[TEXT]
<line: 30> IT IS ORDERED that Defendants shall respond to Plaintiff’s letter [Doc. 7] by filing a 
<line: 31> Martinez report addressing the allegations raised therein.  See Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 
<line: 32> 1109 (10th Cir. 1991) (“When the pro se plaintiff is a prisoner, a court-authorized investigation 
<line: 33> and report by prison officials (referred to as a Martinez report) is not only proper, by may be 
<line: 34> necessary to develop a record sufficient to ascertain whether there are any factual or legal bases 
<line: 35> for the prisoner’s claims.”).  In particular, the report must include information regarding the steps 
<line: 36> taken by Defendants to secure Plaintiff’s physical safety, both from himself and other inmates,

<line: 12> allegations, any request for extension of time must be supported by a particularized
<line: 13> showing of good cause and due diligence.
