<line: 16> vs.

[TITLE]
<line: 18> LUIS ARMONDO RUIZ,

[TITLE]
<line: 20> Defendant.

[TITLE]
<line: 22> REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

[TEXT]
<line: 24> The United States of America and Luis Armondo Ruiz entered into a plea agreement
<line: 25> whereby Defendant agreed to enter a plea of guilty to the lesser included offense in Count One of
<line: 26> an Indictment charging him with being conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine
<line: 27> in violation of 28 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841 (b)(1)(C) and § 846.  On January 25, 2017, Defendant,
<line: 28> accompanied by his counsel, appeared at a hearing to change his plea from not guilty to guilty as
<line: 29> to Count One of the Indictment.  Defendant consented, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(3), to enter
<line: 30> a guilty plea before a Magistrate Judge.  See United States v. Cukaj, 2001 WL 1587410 at *1 (6th
<line: 31> Cir. 2001) (Magistrate Judge may accept a guilty plea with the express consent of the Defendant and
<line: 32> where no objection to the report and recommendation is filed). 

[TEXT]
<line: 34> During the plea proceeding, the undersigned observed the appearance and responsiveness
<line: 35> of Defendant in answering questions.  Based on that observation, the undersigned is satisfied that,
<line: 36> at the time he entered his guilty plea, Defendant was in full possession of his faculties, was not
<line: 37> suffering from any apparent physical or mental illness, and was not under the influence of narcotics
<line: 38> or alcohol.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> Prior to accepting Defendant’s plea, the undersigned addressed him personally and in open
<line: 5> court and determined his competence to plead.  Based on the observations of the undersigned, and
<line: 6> the statements made by Defendant and his counsel,  Defendant understands the nature and meaning
<line: 7> of the charges returned in the Indictment and the consequences of his plea.  Defendant was also
<line: 8> addressed personally and in open court and advised of each of the rights referred to in Rule 11 of
<line: 9> the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  

[TEXT]
<line: 11> Having engaged in the colloquy required by Rule 11, the Court concludes that Defendant’s
<line: 12> plea is voluntary.  Defendant acknowledged that the plea agreement signed by him, his attorney and
<line: 13> the attorney for the United States and filed on January 13, 2017, represents the only promises made
<line: 14> to him by anyone regarding the charges in the Indictment.  The undersigned specifically addressed
<line: 15> those provisions of the plea agreement regarding the agreed sentence under Federal Rule of Criminal
<line: 16> Procedure 11(c)(1)(C).  Defendant was advised that the District Judge may accept or reject the plea
<line: 17> agreement or any term therein, including the agreed sentence. 

[TEXT]
<line: 19> Defendant confirmed the accuracy of the material aspects of the statement of facts supporting
<line: 20> the charge.  He confirmed that he is pleading guilty to Count One of the Indictment because he is
<line: 21> in fact guilty of the offenses charged therein.  The Court concludes that there is a factual basis for
<line: 22> the plea.  

[TEXT]
<line: 24> The Court concludes that Defendant’s plea of guilty to Count One of the Indictment is
<line: 25> knowingly and voluntarily made with the understanding of the nature and meaning of the charge and
<line: 26> of the consequences of his plea.  

[TEXT]
<line: 28> It is therefore RECOMMENDED that Defendant Luis Armondo Ruiz's Hurtado's guilty plea
<line: 29> to Count One of the Indictment be accepted.  Decision on acceptance or rejection of the plea

[TEXT]
<line: 4> agreement was deferred for consideration by the District Judge after the preparation of a presentence
<line: 5> investigation report.    

[TEXT]
<line: 7> A written presentence investigation report will be prepared by the United States Probation
<line: 8> Office.  Defendant will be asked to provide information and his attorney may be present if
<line: 9> Defendant so wishes.  Objections to the presentence report must be made in accordance with the
<line: 10> rules of this Court.  

[TEXT]
<line: 12> If any party seeks review by the District Judge of this Report and Recommendation, that
<line: 13> party may, within fourteen (14) days, file and serve on all parties objections to the Report and
<line: 14> Recommendation, specifically designating this Report and Recommendation, and the part thereof
<line: 15> in question, as well as the basis for objection thereto.  28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1).  Response to objections
<line: 16> must be filed within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy thereof.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b). 

[TEXT]
<line: 18> The parties are specifically advised that the failure to object to the Report and
<line: 19> Recommendation will result in a waiver of the right to de novo review by the District Judge and
<line: 20> waiver of the right to appeal the judgment of the District Court.  See, e.g., Pfahler v. Nat’l Latex
<line: 21> Prod. Co., 517 F.3d 816, 829 (6th Cir. 2007) (holding that “failure to object to the magistrate judge’s
<line: 22> recommendations constituted a waiver of [the defendant’s] ability to appeal the district court’s
<line: 23> ruling”); United States v. Sullivan, 431 F.3d 976, 984 (6th Cir. 2005) (holding that defendant waived
<line: 24> appeal of district court’s denial of pretrial motion by failing to timely object to magistrate judge's
<line: 25> report and recommendation).  Even when timely objections are filed, appellate review of issues not
<line: 26> raised in those objections is waived.  Robert v. Tesson, 507 F.3d 981, 994 (6th Cir. 2007) (“[A]
<line: 27> general objection to a magistrate judge’s report, which fails to specify the issues of contention, does
<line: 28> not suffice to preserve an issue for appeal . . . .”) (citation omitted)).
