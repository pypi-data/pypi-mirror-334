[TEXT]
<line: 44> NOw COMES Plaintiff, Michael Todd, pro se, who brings this Complaint and states as follows:

[TEXT]
<line: 46> In 1991, Congress enacted the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA", 47 U.S.C.
<line: 47>  227 et seq., to regulate the explosive growth of the telemarketing industry. In doing so,
<line: 48> Congress recognized that *unrestricted telemarketing...can be an intrusive invasion of.
<line: 49> privacy..." 47 U.S.C.  227, Congressional Statement of Findings # 5. Specifically, in enacting
<line: 50> the TCPA, Congress outlawed telemarketing via unsolicited automated or pre-recorded
<line: 51> telephone calls, finding:

[TEXT]
<line: 53> Evidence compiled by the Congress indicates that residential telephone subscribers
<line: 54> consider automated or prerecorded telephone calls, regardless of the content or the
<line: 55> initiator of the message, to be a nuisance and an invasion of privacy..

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Case: 1:13-cv-04018 Document #: 2 Filed: 05/30/13 Page 2 of 21 PagelD #:3

[TEXT]
<line: 4> Banning such automated or prerecorded telephone calls to the home, except when the
<line: 5> receiving party consents to receiving the call...is the only effective means of protecting
<line: 6> telephone consumers from this nuisance and invasion of privacy.
<line: 7> 47 U.S.C.  227, Congressional Statement of Findings ## 10 and 12.

[TITLE]
<line: 16> Legal Basis of the Claims

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 13. The claims of Plaintiff, arise, in part, pursuant to the provisions of the TCPA, a federal
<line: 19> statute enacted to prohibit unreasonable invasions of privacy via certain telemarketing
<line: 20> practices.

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 14. The TCPA specifically prohibits the use of an unsolicited prerecorded phone message to
<line: 23> residential telephone subscribers to advertise the sale of goods and services.

[TEXT]
<line: 25> 15. Under the TCPA, as interpreted by the Federal Communications Commission, a person or.
<line: 26> entity can be liable for calls made on its behalf even if that person or entity did not directly.
<line: 27> place those calls.

[TEXT]
<line: 29> 16. The Federal Communications Commission has explained that its "rules generally establish.
<line: 30> that the party on whose behalf a solicitation is made bears ultimate responsibility for any
<line: 31> violations." See Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection
<line: 32> Act of 1991, Memorandum and Order, 10 FCC Rcd. 12391, 12397, Paragraph 13 (1995).

[ABANDON]
<line: 2> Case: 1:13-cv-04018 Document #: 2 Filed: 05/30/13 Page 4 of 21 PagelD #:5

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 17. In 2005, the FCC reiterated that "a company on whose behalf a telephone solicitation is made.
<line: 5> bears the responsibility for any violation of our telemarketing rules and calls placed by a
<line: 6> third party on behalf of that company are treated as if the company itself placed the call."
<line: 7> See Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991;
<line: 8> Request of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company for Clarification and.
<line: 9> Declaratory Ruling, Declaratory Ruling, 20 FCC Rc. 13664, 13667 Paragraph 7 (2005).

[TEXT]
<line: 11> 18. Accordingly, an entity can be liable under the TCPA for a call made on its behalf even if the.
<line: 12> entity did not directly place the call. Under those circumstances, the entity is properly.
<line: 13> deemed to have initiated the call through the person or entity that actually placed the call.

[TEXT]
<line: 15> 19. The phone calls at issue in this case were made by CAREONE, or DOE calling on behalf of.
<line: 16> CAREONE, for the benefit of SILVERSTEIN, CAREONE, HII, COLORADO BANKERS,
<line: 17> FREEDOM LIFE, COMPANION LIFE, MARKEL, STARR, and/or NATIONAL
<line: 18> CASUALTY.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> 20. 47 C.F.R.  64.1200(b) requires, in pertinent part:

[TEXT]
<line: 22> "(b) All artificial or prerecorded voice telephone message shall:.

[TEXT]
<line: 24> (1) At the beginning of the message, state clearly the identity of the business, individual, or
<line: 25> other entity that is responsible for initiating the call. If a business is responsible for
<line: 26> initiating the call, the name under which the entity is registered to conduct business with
<line: 27> the State Corporation Commission (or comparable regulatory authority) must be stated."
