<line: 34> STATEMENT-OPINION

[TEXT]
<line: 36> Reff Properties, LLC (“Reff”) has pending a third-party claim [62] against Bauer Group
<line: 37> Agency, Ltd. (“Bauer”), Michael Woodward, and Auto-Owners Insurance (“Auto-Owners”). 
<line: 38> The third-party complaint asserts a violation of Illinois law, 735 ILCS 5/2-2201(a), by Bauer
<line: 39> (Count I), Woodward (Count II) and Auto-Owners (Count III).  It also asserts claims against
<line: 40> Auto-Owners for negligence (Count IV) and breach of a contract in which Reff was a disclosed
<line: 41> third-party beneficiary.  This third-party action was initially filed as a third-party complaint in a
<line: 42> bankruptcy court adversary proceeding brought by the trustee of the bankruptcy estate of
<line: 43> Pinewood Buffet & Grill, Inc. (“Pinewood”).  On April 9, 2014, this court withdrew the reference
<line: 44> of the adversary proceeding, including the third-party action from the bankruptcy court [12].  The
<line: 45> parties agreed to wait for the court’s decision on summary judgment motions filed in the trustee’s
<line: 46> action before proceeding on the third-party action.  The summary judgment motions were
<line: 47> decided on July 22, 2015 [103].  Auto-Owners now moves [115] to dismiss the third-party

<line: 3> for judgment on the pleadings. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12©1. 

[TEXT]
<line: 5> In the adversary proceeding, the trustee had sought a declaration that the proceeds of
<line: 6> insurance being held in a trust account by Attorney Fishburn pursuant to the terms of a trust
<line: 7> agreement among Reff, Pinewood, and Jennifer Smith were property of the bankruptcy estate. 
<line: 8> Reff had counterclaimed that the bulk of the proceeds belonged to it not the bankruptcy estate. 
<line: 9> Reff and the trustee filed cross motions for summary judgment.  The court ruled the trustee was
<line: 10> entitled to $41,431.58 from the proceeds of insurance on the contents of the building in which
<line: 11> Pinewood operated and that Reff was entitled to the balance of the insurance proceeds
<line: 12> ($439,252.33 on the building and $550.00 on the contents.)  None of the parties (Reff, Smith, or
<line: 13> the third-party defendants) disputed the trustee was entitled to the $41,431.58 from the contents
<line: 14> proceeds.

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 14(a)(1) provides that a “defending party may, as third-
<line: 17> party plaintiff, serve a summons and complaint on a nonparty who is or may be liable to it for all
<line: 18> or part of the claim against it.”  Reff filed such a third-party complaint against the third-party
<line: 19> defendants asking for an order requiring the third-party defendants to indemnify Reff for any
<line: 20> amounts the court awarded to the trustee in the adversary proceeding.  

[TEXT]
<line: 22> The third-party complaint also asks the court to enter judgment in favor of Reff and
<line: 23> against the third-party defendants in a sum in excess of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). 
<line: 24> Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 18(a) provides, inter alia, that a party asserting a “third-party
<line: 25> claim may join, as independent or alternative claims, as many claims as it has against an
<line: 26> opposing party.”  The third-party complaint does not identify specifically what claim the sum in
<line: 27> excess of $50,000 is sought to compensate.  However, the third-party complaint alleges in
<line: 28> paragraph 35(b) that Woodward and Bauer’s actions caused Reff to be injured in that “Reff has
<line: 29> incurred and continues to incur substantial attorneys fees in litigating the claims of Pinewood’s
<line: 30> bankruptcy Trustee to the proceeds of the insurance checks.”  In paragraph 39(a) in a negligence
<line: 31> count against Auto-Owners, the third-party complaint alleges “Reff has incurred and continues to
<line: 32> incur substantial attorney’s fees in litigating the claims of both Smith and Pinewood’s bankruptcy
<line: 33> trustee to the proceeds of such insurance checks.”

<line: 38> Todd and Amy Reid were the sole shareholders of Pinewood.  Bauer was a disclosed

[TEXT]
<line: 2> In August 2009, Reff purchased a building in Freeport, Illinois along with certain
<line: 3> equipment paying $340,000.  $225,000 of the purchase price was allocated to the building and
<line: 4> $115,000 to the equipment.  One year later, in August 2010, Pinewood entered a lease with Reff
<line: 5> for the real property and equipment.  The lease required Pinewood to provide fire and casualty
<line: 6> insurance on the leased premises with Reff as the named insured and liability and dram shop
<line: 7> insurance with Reff named as an additional insured.  Pinewood worked with Woodward to obtain
<line: 8> insurance on the premises from Auto-Owners through its agent, Bauer.  At some point,
<line: 9> Woodward advised Amy that Reff could not be identified as the “named insured” on the
<line: 10> proposed policy because Pinewood would be the entity paying the premiums. 

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Smith lent Pinewood $100,000 to start its business evidenced by a promissory note. 
<line: 13> Smith’s loan to Pinewood was unsecured.  Prior to making the loan to Pinewood, Smith
<line: 14> indicated to Pinewood’s owners that she wanted to be secured in connection with her anticipated
<line: 15> loan and raised the topic of insurance.  Amy advised Smith that Amy had spoken with
<line: 16> Woodward who had told Amy that Smith could be added to the insurance policy.  Smith assumed
<line: 17> that if she was identified in the insurance policy, in the event of a casualty, Reff would receive
<line: 18> the fair market value of the building and then she would be paid the balance of her loan.  Todd
<line: 19> testified that approximately a week before the execution of the lease agreement with Reff, Todd
<line: 20> had a discussion with Woodward.  From this discussion, Todd understood Reff was to be the
<line: 21> beneficiary of the building and personal property portion of the contemplated insurance policy.

[TEXT]
<line: 23> An insurance binder, dated August 10, 2010, was issued by Bauer with an effective date
<line: 24> of August 11, 2010 and expiration date of September 10, 2010 listing Pinewood as the insured. 
<line: 25> The binder bound coverage for property insurance (with coverage forms for “Building, Business
<line: 26> Contents, Sign, Food Spoilage”.)  It also bound coverage for commercial general liability, excess
<line: 27> liability, and workers’ compensation and employer’s liability coverages.  Reff was listed on the
<line: 28> binder and its interest was indicated by check marks being placed in 3 separate boxes one each
<line: 29> labeled respectively “mortgagee”, “loss payee”, and “additional insured”.  An additional binder,
<line: 30> dated August 10, 2010, was also issued by Bauer with an effective date of August 11, 2010 and
<line: 31> expiration date of September 10, 2010 listing Pinewood as the insured.  It was identical to the
<line: 32> other binder except that Reff was not listed and, instead, Smith was listed as loss payee.  An
<line: 33> insurance application was made on behalf of Pinewood in which Pinewood is listed as the named
<line: 34> insured, Smith as an additional interest of “loss payee” and Reff as an additional interest of
<line: 35> “mortgagee”.  When the policy itself was issued by Auto-Owners, however, it did not list Reff as
<line: 36> the named insured (as called for by the lease) or as mortgagee, loss payee and additional insured
<line: 37> as provided in the binder.  The policy listed Pinewood as the insured and listed only Smith in the
<line: 38> section “secured interested parties and/or additional interested parties.”  Smith’s interest is
<line: 39> identified as “loss payable”.  The policy was for the period August 11, 2010 to August 11, 2011. 
<line: 40> Todd and Amy received a copy of this policy but did not read it. 

[TEXT]
<line: 42>  A fire occurred on June 2, 2011.  On June 3, 2011, Reff’s owner (Peter Reff) and
<line: 43> Pinewood’s owners were told by Peter Salm, the insurance adjuster for Auto-Owners, that Reff
<line: 44> was not named on the insurance policy as either the named insured or in any other capacity.

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Subsequently, on June 14, 2011, a change endorsement to the policy was made.  The change is
<line: 3> described on a policy declaration page as: “added the following mortgagee: Reff Properties.” 
<line: 4> The declaration page notes “Change Endorsement Effective 08-11-2010."  August 11, 2010 was
<line: 5> the original effective date of the policy and the binders mentioned above.  As set forth above, 
<line: 6> Reff did not hold a mortgage on the property.  Reff owned the property and leased it to
<line: 7> Pinewood.  At no time after June 2, 2011 but prior to June 14, 2011 did anyone have any
<line: 8> discussion with Smith about adding Reff to the insurance policy post-fire.

[TEXT]
<line: 10> On November 29, 2011 Auto-Owners issued a check (“Building Check”) in the sum of
<line: 11> $439,252.33 payable to Pinewood, Reff, and Smith for the “actual cash value of building less
<line: 12> deductible and mitigation.”  On that date, Auto-Owners also issued a check (“Contents Check”)
<line: 13> in the amount of $41,981.58 payable to Pinewood and Reff for the “actual cash value of contents
<line: 14> less mitigation.” 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> In February 2012, the parties deposited these checks into Fishburn’s trust account
<line: 17> pursuant to an attorneys trust account agreement (“Trust Agreement”) dated “February __, 2012.” 
<line: 18> The Trust Agreement provides in relevant part that the Building Check is “to be disbursed as
<line: 19> directed pursuant to a written agreement executed by Pinewood Buffet & Grill, Inc., Reff
<line: 20> Properties, LLC and Jennifer Smith, or in lieu thereof, pursuant to court order.”  The Trust
<line: 21> Agreement further provides that the “parties hereto agree that this Agreement is entered into for
<line: 22> the purposes of facilitating receipt of said checks from the Insurance company pending resolution
<line: 23> of current issues between the parties and said sum as held in said trust account shall have the
<line: 24> same legal character for all purposes as when held by the insurance company subject to the terms
<line: 25> of the relevant insurance policy.”  No agreement was reached and eventually Pinewood filed a
<line: 26> Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on August 30, 2012.

[TEXT]
<line: 28> In ruling on the summary judgment motions, the court found (among other things) that
<line: 29> the post-fire change endorsement to the policy issued June 14, 2011 reformed the policy to
<line: 30> conform it to the contract of insurance formed by the August 10, 2010 binder which named Reff
<line: 31> as mortgagee, loss payee, and additional insured.  Reff was entitled to the insurance proceeds
<line: 32> attributable to loss to the building. Pinewood never had an interest in those proceeds so
<line: 33> Pinewood’s bankruptcy trustee never obtained an interest in them.  The court also found that
<line: 34> Smith, as an unsecured creditor of Pinewood, did not have an insurable interest in the property
<line: 35> and, therefore, had no claim to the proceeds, despite having been listed as a loss payee on the
<line: 36> policy.

[TEXT]
<line: 38> Because the court awarded Reff the disputed insurance proceeds, Reff’s claims against
<line: 39> the third-party defendants for indemnification for any amounts awarded to the trustee are moot.   
<line: 40> The crux of what remains of Reff’s third-party complaint is Reff’s claim that Bauer, Woodward,
<line: 41> and Auto-Owners, by failing initially to cause the policy to issue with Reff listed as a loss payee,
<line: 42> and, by listing Smith as a loss payee, though she had no insurable interest in the property,
<line: 43> damaged Reff by forcing it a) to incur legal fees and costs in litigating the trustee’s adversary

<line: 5> “In order to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must state a
<line: 6> claim to relief that is plausible on its face.  A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff
<line: 7> pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is
<line: 8> liable for the misconduct alleged.” Lodholtz v. York Risk Services Group, 778 F.3d 635, 639 (7th

[TEXT]
<line: 12> The third-party defendants argue that, under the “American Rule” governing the recovery
<line: 13> of attorneys’ fees, Reff cannot state a claim for the recovery of attorneys’ fees.  They also argue
<line: 14> their actions were not wrongful and were not the proximate cause of Reff having to incur
<line: 15> attorneys’ fees.  Reff maintains the “American Rule” does not apply to the facts as alleged in this
<line: 16> case, that attorneys’ fees are recoverable on the facts alleged, and that defendants’ actions were
<line: 17> wrongful and were the proximate cause of Reff having to incur those attorneys’ fees. 

[TEXT]
<line: 19>  Under Illinois law, “[w]here the wrongful acts of a defendant involve the plaintiff in
<line: 20> litigation with third parties or place him in such relation with others as to make it necessary to
<line: 21> incur expense to protect his interest, the plaintiff can then recover damages against such
<line: 22> wrongdoer, measured by the reasonable expenses of such litigation, including attorney fees.”
<line: 23> Ohio Nat’l Life Assurance Corp.v Davis, 803 F.3d 904, 910 (7th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation
<line: 24> marks and citations omitted).  So, while the “American Rule”, with limited exceptions, generally
<line: 25> bars recovering attorneys’ fees incurred in pursuing or defending a claim (if A sues B for
<line: 26> negligence, neither A nor B can recover attorneys fees incurred in prosecuting or defending that, 
<line: 27> claim) see, Schrempf, Kelly, Napp & Darr, Ltd. v. Carpenters’ Health and Welfare Trust Fund,
<line: 28> 35 N.E.3d 988, 991-92 (Ill. App. 2015), attorneys’ fees are recoverable in a case where the
<line: 29> attorneys’ fees were incurred because the defendant’s wrongful actions required the plaintiff to
<line: 30> pay an attorney to “protect his interest.” Davis, 803 F.3d at 910. 

[TEXT]
<line: 32> In Davis, the Court of Appeals considered an appeal from a district court judgment which
<line: 33> awarded the plaintiff, Ohio National, along with other damages, “$605,395.15 in damages in the
<line: 34> form of attorney’s fees and costs expended in seeking the declaratory judgment.” Ohio Nat’l Life
<line: 35> Assurance Corp. v. Davis, 10 C 2386, 2014 WL 5420057, *10 (N.D. Ill. October 24, 2014)
<line: 36> (Durkin, J.)  There, the plaintiff had sued one set of defendants for damages for conspiracy, fraud
<line: 37> and breach of contract in procuring certain life insurance policies and another set of defendants
<line: 38> for a declaratory judgment that insurance policies they owned were void ab initio due to their
<line: 39> having been procured by the fraud, conspiracy, and breach of contract of the first set of
<line: 40> defendants.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s award of attorneys’fees incurred
<line: 41> in the declaratory judgment portion of the lawsuit. Davis, 803 F.3d at 910.

[TEXT]
<line: 43> Reff’s claims here are not barred by the “American Rule.”  The third-party defendants
<line: 44> argue attorneys’ fees are only recoverable where they are incurred in an action separate from the

[ABANDON]
<line: 46> 5

[TEXT]
<line: 2> action in which they are sought to be recovered.  They argue that since the fees incurred by Reff
<line: 3> in litigating with the trustee about the insurance proceeds were incurred in the same action in
<line: 4> which Reff brings this third-party action seeking to recover the fees from the third-party
<line: 5> defendants, that the fees sought are not recoverable.  However, Davis clearly belies this
<line: 6> argument.2  They also contend attorneys’fees are only recoverable in the case of “willful,
<line: 7> malicious or affirmative wrongful acts” citing in their reply brief Insurance Co. of North America
<line: 8> v. J.J. Hubbard Co., 318 N.E.2d 289 (Ill. App. 1974).  But, this does not appear to be the law in
<line: 9> Illinois.  Negligence has been held to be sufficient. Sorenson v. Fio Rito, 413 N.E.2d 47 (Ill.
<line: 10> App. 1980).  Reff alleges the third-party defendants wrongful actions forced it to incur
<line: 11> attorneys’fees in litigating its claim to the proceeds against the claims of the trustee and Smith. 
<line: 12> These allegations are sufficient to take the case outside the “American Rule”.   

[TEXT]
<line: 14> Under Illinois law, “[g]enerally, proximate cause is an issue of material fact to be
<line: 15> determined by the trier of fact.  But proximate cause may be determined as a matter of law where
<line: 16> the facts show that the plaintiff would never be entitled to recover.  Proximate cause consists of
<line: 17> two requirements: cause in fact and legal cause.”  Rahic v. Satellite Air-Land Motor Service, 24
<line: 18> N.E.3d 315, 321 (Ill. App. 2014) (citations omitted).  To be a “cause in fact” defendant’s
<line: 19> “conduct must constitute a material element and a substantial factor in bringing about the injury. 
<line: 20> If the plaintiff’s injury would not have occurred absent the defendant’s conduct, then the conduct
<line: 21> forms a material element and substantial factor in bringing about the injury.” Id. (internal
<line: 22> quotation marks and citations omitted).  “Legal cause” is a determination that “the injury is of the
<line: 23> type that a reasonable person would see as a likely result of his or her conduct.” Id. (citations
<line: 24> omitted).

[TEXT]
<line: 26> Because the court previously determined that the post-fire reformation of the policy was
<line: 27> effective, the original failure to name Reff on the policy was not the proximate cause of Reff’s
<line: 28> claimed losses arising from the trustee’s claim to the proceeds.  Likewise, the naming of Smith as
<line: 29> a loss payee on the policy was not the proximate cause of Reff’s claimed losses arising from the
<line: 30> trustee’s claim to the proceeds. 

[TEXT]
<line: 32> The reformation occurred more than a year before Pinewood’s bankruptcy.  The
<line: 33> reformation was effective to make Reff a loss payee under the policy as its interests appeared. 
<line: 34> Since Reff owned the building, its interest was clear.  The failure of the originally issued policy
<line: 35> to conform to the terms of the insurance binder was corrected by the post-fire reformation which
<line: 36> made the correction effective as of August 11, 2010, the date the original binder was issued.  A
<line: 37> reasonable person would not likely have foreseen that after the third-party defendants corrected
<line: 38> (effective as of the original binder date) an error in the insurance policy they had bound and
<line: 39> issued in order to conform the terms of that policy to the terms agreed upon by Pinewood and the

<line: 2> years after the effective date of the reformed policy) Pinewood would file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy
<line: 3> petition and that the trustee of that bankruptcy estate would bring an adversary proceeding
<line: 4> against Reff claiming Reff was not entitled to the insurance proceeds despite being named as a
<line: 5> loss payee by virtue of the change endorsement and clearly being the owner of the building which
<line: 6> suffered the loss that generated the proceeds.  

[TEXT]
<line: 8> As detailed in the court’s order on summary judgment, there was no dispute that Reff
<line: 9> owned the building, that the lease required Pinewood to provide insurance on that building with
<line: 10> Reff as the insured, that the parties to the insurance contract intended Reff to be covered by the
<line: 11> policy, that those parties intended to correct the policy, through the change endorsement, to
<line: 12> conform it to the contract when they discovered the policy did not conform, and that the change
<line: 13> endorsement was issued making that correction.  Given these facts, a reasonable person would
<line: 14> have been unlikely to foresee the chain of events leading to the trustee’s adversary complaint
<line: 15> against Reff.   

[TEXT]
<line: 17> Reff also argues the third-party defendants naming Smith as a loss payee, though Smith
<line: 18> clearly had no insurable interest in the building or equipment, caused Reff to incur attorneys’ fees
<line: 19> in the trustee’s adversary proceeding.  Taking as true the allegations of Reff’s third-party
<line: 20> complaint, Smith was named a loss payee on the policy based on Woodward advising Amy that
<line: 21> Pinewood could add Smith to the policy as a way of providing Smith some “security” for the
<line: 22> loan Smith made to Pinewood.  But, Smith clearly had no insurable interest in the building
<line: 23> owned by Reff or in any asset of Pinewood.  Smith could never have recovered under the policy
<line: 24> because she could never suffer a loss to covered property.  She had no interest in any covered
<line: 25> property. 

[TEXT]
<line: 27> Third-party defendants counter that the erroneous naming of Smith was not the proximate
<line: 28> cause of Reff’s incurring attorneys’fees in the trustee’s action.  They argue that the trustee’s
<line: 29> decision to claim Reff had no interest in the proceeds, rather than anything to do with Smith
<line: 30> being listed as a loss payee, was the proximate cause of any attorneys’fees Reff incurred.

[TEXT]
<line: 32> The third-party defendants are correct as to the attorneys’fees incurred by Reff in the
<line: 33> adversary proceeding.  The trustee brought the adversary proceeding alleging that Reff was not
<line: 34> named on the original insurance policy as an insured or loss payee.  Only Pinewood was listed as
<line: 35> the insured on the policy.  Since only Pinewood was the named insured at the time of the loss, the
<line: 36> trustee alleged Pinewood’s bankruptcy estate alone was entitled to the insurance proceeds.  The
<line: 37> adversary complaint alleges Smith was an unsecured creditor of Pinewood and that Smith was
<line: 38> listed on the policy under the heading “Secured Interested Parties.” 

[TEXT]
<line: 40>  In her answer to the adversary complaint, Smith admitted she was an unsecured creditor
<line: 41> and admitted that the bankruptcy estate was entitled to the insurance proceeds.  Smith never
<line: 42> advanced a claim in the adversary proceeding that she was entitled to any of the proceeds.  The
<line: 43> trustee did not claim that Smith had an interest in the proceeds and that the trustee was entitled to
<line: 44> step into Smith’s shoes and enforce that interest on behalf of the estate. 

[ABANDON]
<line: 46> 7

[TEXT]
<line: 2>  The only way Smith being listed on the policy came into play in the adversary
<line: 3> proceeding was the trustee’s argument on summary judgment that the change endorsement
<line: 4> correcting the mistaken omission of Reff was ineffective because Smith did not consent to it. 
<line: 5> However, Smith’s consent was not required. Smith admitted in her answer to the trustee’s
<line: 6> adversary complaint that she was an unsecured creditor of Pinewood.  As such, she had no
<line: 7> insurable interest in the covered property and thus no voice in the policy’s being reformed. See
<line: 8> Dkt # 103, p. 6. 

[TEXT]
<line: 10> As discussed above, a reasonable person would not likely have foreseen the trustee’s suit
<line: 11> coming much less that in that suit the trustee would make the unwinnable argument that an
<line: 12> admittedly unsecured creditor, with no insurable interest in the covered property, was required to
<line: 13> consent to the policy’s reformation.

<line: 15> In sum, neither the failure to name Reff nor the naming of Smith on the original policy
<line: 16> were the proximate cause of Reff being sued in the adversary proceeding and having to incur
<line: 17> attorneys’fees to defend its interests in that suit.  The trustee’s decision to seek to obtain
<line: 18> insurance proceeds that contractually belonged to Reff by attempting to negate that contract was
<line: 19> the proximate cause of Reff having to litigate its right to the proceeds in this action.  Reff cannot
<line: 20> recover the attorneys’ fees and costs it incurred in the action brought against it by the trustee.

<line: 22> Reff also alleges it was forced to incur attorneys’ fees in litigating Smith’s claim to the
<line: 23> proceeds.  While Smith obviously had no insurable interest in the covered property, Reff alleges
<line: 24> she was listed as a loss payee on the policy and when Auto-Owners issued the Building Check it
<line: 25> made the check payable to Pinewood, Reff and Smith.  According to the allegations in the third-
<line: 26> party complaint, Smith would only endorse this check if it and the Contents Check were placed
<line: 27> in escrow.  The proceeds were, in fact, placed in escrow under the terms of an agreement that
<line: 28> allowed them to be disbursed only upon the agreement of Reff, Pinewood and Smith or by court
<line: 29> order.  No agreement was reached so, Reff argues, litigation with Smith, and its attendant costs
<line: 30> and attorneys’ fees, was Reff’s only option to secure the proceeds it was entitled to be paid under
<line: 31> the policy.

[TEXT]
<line: 33> These allegations are sufficient to state a claim against Auto-Owners.3  Taking the
<line: 34> allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in Reff’s favor, the third-party
<line: 35> defendants, knowing that Smith had no insurable interest in the covered property, listed her as a
<line: 36> loss payee.  Doing this would have been harmless to Reff if Auto-Owners had paid Reff for its
<line: 37> loss to covered property after the fire.  Smith’s status would have been irrelevant to Reff as long
<line: 38> as Reff got paid in full.  However, when Auto-Owners failed to pay Reff the proceeds it was due
<line: 39> and instead paid the proceeds to Smith, Reff and Pinewood as joint payees, Auto-Owners put

<line: 42> required to incur attorneys’fees in litigating the claims of Smith. Dkt # 62, p.11, par. 39(a).  The
<line: 43> allegation applicable to the other counts only alleges Reff was forced to incur attorneys’fees in

<line: 2> Reff in the position where it had to "incur expense to protect [its] interest." Davis, 803 F.3d at
<line: 3> 910. Unless Smith agreed to sign over the proceeds to Reff without any cost to Reff, Reff was
<line: 4> stuck either suing Smith to compel her to release the proceeds to Reff or paying Smith something
<line: 5> to get her to sign. Reff alleges Smith did not agree to sign the proceeds over to Reff and Reff had
<line: 6> to bring an action against Smith to obtain release of the proceeds to Reff..

[TEXT]
<line: 8> These allegations are sufficient to plausibly allege that Auto-Owners is liable to Reff for
<line: 9> costs associated with Reff's action against Smith to obtain release of the proceeds Auto-Owners
<line: 10> wrongly paid not to Reff but to Reff, Pinewood, and Smith jointly..

[TEXT]
<line: 12> It is important to note at this point that surviving a motion to dismiss is not the same as
<line: 13> winning the case. Evidence may prove Auto-Owners was justified in acting as it did. It may be
<line: 14> difficult for Reff to parse out its legal expenses attributable to the surviving claim from its
<line: 15> expenses attributable to the other aspects of this action and the trustee's action. Before the
<line: 16> parties incur more litigation expenses in this third-party action (which they all agree at this point
<line: 17> will not be recoverable from the other), they would be well advised to settle this matter. The
<line: 18> remaining parties are directed to contact Magistrate Judge Johnston to schedule a settlement

<line: 21> For the foregoing reasons, Woodward and Bauer's motion [113] for judgment on the.
<line: 22> pleadings is granted. Judgment is entered in favor of Woodward and Bauer and against Reff on
<line: 23> Counts I and II. Auto-Owners' motion [115] is granted in part and denied in part. Auto-Owners

<line: 25> except the claim for litigation expenses, including attorneys' fees and costs, incurred by Reff in
<line: 26> its litigation with Smith arising from Smith being made a joint payee on the Building Check.
<line: 27> The motion is denied as to that claim. The remaining parties are directed to contact Magistrate
