<line: 20> MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> This matter is before the Court, sua sponte under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2) and rule 12(b)(6) 
<line: 23> of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, on Plaintiff’s civil rights complaint [Doc. 1], supplemental 
<line: 24> complaint [Doc. 5], and Plaintiff’s letter [Doc. 7], which the Court liberally has construed as a 
<line: 25> motion for emergency injunctive relief.  [See Doc. 9]  Plaintiff is incarcerated, appears pro se, 
<line: 26> and is proceeding in forma pauperis.  For the reasons explained below, Plaintiff’s complaint will 
<line: 27> be dismissed under § 1915(e)(2) for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies, the Court will 
<line: 28> decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims in Plaintiff’s supplemental 
<line: 29> complaint, Plaintiff’s motion for emergency injunctive relief will be denied, and judgment will be 
<line: 30> entered.

<line: 33> FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 

[TEXT]
<line: 35> Plaintiff is a wheelchair-bound inmate incarcerated at Northeast New Mexico Detention 
<line: 36> Facility (NENMDF).  [Doc. 1]  On February 8, 2016, Plaintiff filed his prisoner civil rights 
<line: 37> complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that Defendants have failed to provide him with 
<line: 38> handicap-access to outdoor recreation areas, tables, and restrooms.  [Doc. 1]  Plaintiff further

[TEXT]
<line: 4> alleges that he has been “bulldogged” by other inmates and “beaten up by same inmates for [his] 
<line: 5> canteen.”  [Doc. 1 at 2]  Plaintiff also complains about the presence of drugs at NENMDF and 
<line: 6> contends that Defendant Major Montoya knows about these drugs, but “won’t do anything about 
<line: 7> it.”  [Doc. 1 at 3]  Lastly, Plaintiff alleges that NENMDF “has a gang that really wants [him] 
<line: 8> dead.”  [Doc. 1 at 6] 

[TEXT]
<line: 10> On February 29, 2016, Plaintiff filed a supplement to his civil rights complaint, which 
<line: 11> raises claims under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. § 41-4-1, et seq.  [Doc. 5]  
<line: 12> Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have failed to provide him with handicap access to outdoor 
<line: 13> recreation or a table at which he can eat, and that the cell provided for him fails to comply with the 
<line: 14> American with Disabilities Act Guidelines.  [Doc. 5 at 2]  Plaintiff further alleges that he is being 
<line: 15> “bulldogged” by other inmates, that his mental health is deteriorating, and that Defendants have 
<line: 16> retaliated against him for filing the present lawsuit by revoking all of his good-time credit in a 
<line: 17> disciplinary proceeding.  [Doc. 5 at 4] 

[TEXT]
<line: 19> On February 29, 2016, Plaintiff filed a letter with the Court in which he expressed his 
<line: 20> imminent intention to kill himself.  [Doc. 7]  In his letter, Plaintiff stated that his “life is in 
<line: 21> danger,” he faces death by true predators,” and rather than “get beaten to death,” he has chosen to 
<line: 22> “die by his own hands.”  [Id. at 1-4]  The Court liberally construed the letter as a motion for 
<line: 23> emergency injunctive relief and ordered Defendants to file a Limited Martinez Report addressing 
<line: 24> “the steps taken by Defendants to secure Plaintiff’s physical safety, both from himself and other 
<line: 25> inmates.”  [Doc. 9] 

[TEXT]
<line: 27> On March 17, 2016, Defendants timely filed their Limited Martinez Report.  [Doc. 19]  
<line: 28> Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s motion for emergency injunctive relief should be denied, 
<line: 29> because Plaintiff “is not in imminent danger of harming himself, or of being harmed by others.”

<line: 4> [Doc. 19 at 2]  Defendants also move to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint for failure to state a claim 
<line: 5> upon which relief may be granted pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  [Doc. 19 at 3]  
<line: 6> Alternatively, Defendants move the Court to “enter summary judgment for Defendants on all of 
<line: 7> the claims asserted herein because [Plaintiff] has not exhausted his administrative remedies.”

<line: 9> [Doc. 19 at 3] 

[TEXT]
<line: 11> Plaintiff has filed various letters and motions for the appointment of counsel, which the 
<line: 12> Court liberally will construe, in relevant part, as responses to the Limited Martinez Report.  
<line: 13> [Docs. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]  In his responses, Plaintiff contends that the Limited Martinez Report is 
<line: 14> “wrong” because all of his “good-time was not taken” in his disciplinary proceeding, but rather 
<line: 15> “only 12 days.”  [Doc. 21 at 1; Doc. 24 at 11]  Plaintiff further contends that the Limited 
<line: 16> Martinez Report is full of “so many lies.” [Doc. 22 at 1]  For example, Plaintiff alleges that 
<line: 17> neither the outdoor recreation area nor the outdoor restrooms are handicap-accessible and that he 
<line: 18> never threatened to throw urine at Defendant Brown.  [Doc. 24 at 4-10]

<line: 23> A. 
<line: 24> Plaintiff’s Complaint Will Be Dismissed For Failure to Exhaust His Administrative 
<line: 25> Remedies 

[TEXT]
<line: 27> The Court has the discretion to dismiss an in forma pauperis complaint sua sponte under 
<line: 28> § 1915(e)(2) “at any time if . . . the action . . . is frivolous or malicious; [or] fails to state a claim on 
<line: 29> which relief may be granted.”  Section 1915(e)(2) gives the district court “the unusual power to 
<line: 30> pierce the veil of the complaint’s factual allegations and dismiss those claims whose factual 
<line: 31> contentions are clearly baseless” or whose legal basis is “indisputably meritless.”  Hall v. 
<line: 32> Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1109 (10th Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

<line: 4> officials (referred as a Martinez report) is not only proper, but may be necessary to develop a 
<line: 5> record sufficient to ascertain whether there are any factual or legal bases for the prisoner’s claims.”  
<line: 6> Id.  A court may consider a Martinez report in dismissing a claim pursuant to § 1915(e)(2), but it 
<line: 7> may not “resolve material disputed factual issues by accepting the report’s factual findings when 
<line: 8> they are in conflict with the pleadings or affidavits.”  Id.  In reviewing Plaintiff’s pro se 
<line: 9> complaint, the Court applies the same legal standards applicable to pleadings drafted by counsel 
<line: 10> but liberally construes the allegations.  See Northington v. Jackson, 973 F.2d 1518, 1520-21 (10th 
<line: 11> Cir. 1992). 

[TEXT]
<line: 13> Plaintiff’s complaint is governed by the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), which 
<line: 14> requires a prisoner challenging prison conditions to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to 
<line: 15> filing suit in federal court.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) (“No action shall be brought with respect to 
<line: 16> prison conditions under section 1983 of this title or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined 
<line: 17> in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available 
<line: 18> are exhausted.”).  Indeed, a prisoner “must complete the administrative review process in 
<line: 19> accordance with the applicable procedural rules, including deadlines, as a precondition to bringing 
<line: 20> suit in federal court.”  Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 88 (2006).  Under the PLRA, “[e]xhaustion 
<line: 21> is no longer left to the discretion of the district court, but is mandatory.”  Id. at 85. 

[TEXT]
<line: 23> To determine whether Plaintiff has exhausted his administrative remedies, the Court 
<line: 24> considers the materials provided by Defendants in the Limited Martinez Report.  See Ketchum v. 
<line: 25> Cruz, 961 F.2d 916, 920 (10th Cir. 1992) (“In contrast to dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), 
<line: 26> dismissal under [§ 1915(e)(2)] may follow consideration of material outside the pleadings, and 
<line: 27> specifically may follow consideration of a Martinez report.”).  NENMDF has a grievance 
<line: 28> procedure consisting of three steps: (1) submission of an inmate informal complaint; (2)

<line: 4> submission of a formal grievance; and (3) a department-level appeal to the Secretary of the 
<line: 5> Department of Corrections.  [Doc. 19 at 12; Doc. 19-18 (Exhibit P) and 19-19 (Exhibit Q)].  An 
<line: 6> inmate exhausts his available administrative remedies by “[t]he completion of the grievance 
<line: 7> process through the Department-level appeal.”  [Id.] 

[TEXT]
<line: 9> According to the information in the Limited Martinez Report, Plaintiff has not filed any 
<line: 10> “informal complaints, formal grievances or grievance appeals regarding alleged issues with 
<line: 11> handicap accessibility to outdoor recreation areas at NENMDF.”  [Doc. 19 at 13; Doc. 19-18 at 2 
<line: 12> (Exhibit P)]  Additionally, Plaintiff has not filed any “any inmate informal complaints, formal 
<line: 13> grievances, or grievance appeals regarding alleged ‘bulldogging’ or harassment by other inmates 
<line: 14> at NENMDF.”  [Id.]  In his responses to the Limited Martinez Report, Plaintiff does not dispute 
<line: 15> these facts, nor does he allege that his failure to file any informal complaints, formal grievances, or 
<line: 16> grievance appeals was caused by the action or inaction of prison officials.  See 
<line: 17> Aquilar-Avellaveda v. Terrell, 478 F.3d 1223, 1225 (10th Cir. 2007) (noting that prior to 
<line: 18> dismissing a civil rights complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the PLRA, 
<line: 19> courts “are obligated to ensure that any defects in exhaustion were not procured from the action or 
<line: 20> inaction of prison officials”).  Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed 
<line: 21> to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by the PLRA and will dismiss Plaintiff’s civil 
<line: 22> rights complaint [Doc. 1] without prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be 
<line: 23> granted under § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).  See Gallagher v. Shelton, 587 F.3d 1063, 1068 (10th Cir. 
<line: 24> 2009) (“Ordinarily, a dismissal based on a failure to exhaust administrative remedies should be 
<line: 25> without prejudice.” (emphasis in original)). 

[TEXT]
<line: 27> Plaintiff’s supplemental complaint raises state law claims under the New Mexico Tort 
<line: 28> Claims Act.  [Doc. 5]  Title 28 of the United States Code, section 1367(c) provides that the Court

<line: 4> may “decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim . . . if . . . the district court has 
<line: 5> dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.”  28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).  The Tenth 
<line: 6> Circuit Court of Appeals has “generally held that if federal claims are dismissed before trial, 
<line: 7> leaving only issues of state law, the federal court should decline the exercise of jurisdiction by 
<line: 8> dismissing the case without prejudice.”  Brooks v. Gaenzle, 614 F.3d 1213, 1229 (10th Cir. 2010) 
<line: 9> (internal quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted).  In light of the dismissal of Plaintiff’s 
<line: 10> federal claims, the Court will decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s state 
<line: 11> law claims and, therefore, Plaintiff’s supplemental complaint will be dismissed without prejudice.

<line: 13> B. 
<line: 14> Plaintiff’s Motion for Emergency Injunctive Relief Will be Denied 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> To obtain a preliminary injunction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, “the moving 
<line: 17> party must demonstrate four factors:  (1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a likelihood 
<line: 18> that the movant will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the 
<line: 19> balance of the equities tips in the movants favor; and (4) that the injunction is in the public 
<line: 20> interest.”  RoDa Drilling Co. v. Siegal, 552 F.3d 1203, 1208 (10th Cir. 2009).  The Tenth Circuit 
<line: 21> Court of Appeals has warned that “courts should be especially cautious when granting an 
<line: 22> injunction that requires the nonmoving party to take affirmative action—a mandatory preliminary 
<line: 23> injunction—before a trial on the merits,” because “the primary goal of a preliminary injunction is 
<line: 24> to preserve the pre-trial status quo.”  Id.  Since mandatory preliminary injunctions “are 
<line: 25> traditionally disfavored,” the moving party “seeking such an injunction [must] make a heightened 
<line: 26> showing of the four factors.”  Id. 

[TEXT]
<line: 28> Plaintiff is proceeding pro se and, therefore, the Court must construe his filings liberally 
<line: 29> and hold them “to a less stringent standard.”  Hall, 935 F.2d at 1110.  However, it is not “the 
<line: 30> proper function of the district court to assume the role of advocate for the pro se litigant.”  Id.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> Furthermore, pro se status “does not relieve the plaintiff of the burden of alleging sufficient facts 
<line: 5> on which a recognized legal claim could be based.”  Id. 

[TEXT]
<line: 7> In light of the dismissal of Plaintiff’s complaint and supplemental complaint [Docs. 1, 5], 
<line: 8> the Court concludes that Plaintiff is unlikely to succeed on the merits of his claims.  See part II.A, 
<line: 9> supra.  Therefore, the first factor does not weigh in favor of the issuance of emergency injunctive 
<line: 10> relief. 

[TEXT]
<line: 12> The second factor, irreparable harm, also does not weigh in favor of the issuance of 
<line: 13> emergency injunctive relief.  “To constitute irreparable harm, an injury must be certain, great, 
<line: 14> actual and not theoretical.”  Heideman v. South Salt Lake City, 348 F.3d 1182, 1189 (10th Cir. 
<line: 15> 2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  “Irreparable harm is not harm that is 
<line: 16> merely serious or substantial,” rather it is harm of “such imminence that there is a clear and present 
<line: 17> need for equitable relief.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted; emphasis in 
<line: 18> original).  According to the Limited Martinez Report, Plaintiff currently is housed in a 
<line: 19> segregation unit, where he “he has no physical access to any other inmate at NENMDF.”  [Doc. 
<line: 20> 19 at 13]  Corrections officers visually monitor Plaintiff twice every hour [Doc. 19 at 13] and 
<line: 21> Plaintiff receives “regular visits from mental health providers and medical personnel.”  [Doc. 19 
<line: 22> at 17]  Each time “Plaintiff makes self-injurious remarks, he is evaluated by mental health 
<line: 23> providers” and Plaintiff “has repeatedly denied suicidal ideation.”  [Doc. 19 at 19]  Plaintiff does 
<line: 24> not dispute these facts, but rather, confirms that he is housed in segregation where he does not have 
<line: 25> access to other inmates.  [Doc. 24 at 2-3]  On the basis of the foregoing, the Court concludes that 
<line: 26> Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate an irreparable risk of harm to his physical safety, either from 
<line: 27> himself or other inmates.

<line: 4> relief.  The PLRA provides, in relevant part, that: 

[TEXT]
<line: 6> Prospective relief in any civil action with respect to prison 
<line: 7> conditions shall extend no further than necessary to correct the 
<line: 8> violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs. 
<line: 9> The court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the 
<line: 10> court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further 
<line: 11> than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the 
<line: 12> least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the 
<line: 13> Federal right. The court shall give substantial weight to any adverse 
<line: 14> impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system 
<line: 15> caused by the relief. 

[TEXT]
<line: 17> 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1).  As the Supreme Court has recognized, “courts are ill equipped to deal 
<line: 18> with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform.”  Turner v. Safley, 
<line: 19> 482 U.S. 78, 84 (1987).  Indeed, “[r]unning a prison is an inordinately difficult task that requires 
<line: 20> expertise, planning, and the commitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly within the 
<line: 21> province of the legislative and executive branches of government.” Id. at 84-85.  Therefore, 
<line: 22> “separation of powers concerns counsel a policy of judicial restraint.”  Id. at 85; see Meachum v. 
<line: 23> Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 228-29 (1976) (holding that the federal courts should not become involved in 
<line: 24> “the day-to-day function of state prisons”).  Neither the balance of the equities nor the public 
<line: 25> interest would be served by the issuance of mandatory injunctive relief involving the Court in the 
<line: 26> day-to-day management of prison life. 

[TEXT]
<line: 28> For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed to make a 
<line: 29> heightened showing that he is entitled to emergency injunctive relief.  Accordingly, his motion 
<line: 30> for emergency injunctive relief [Doc. 7] will be denied.
