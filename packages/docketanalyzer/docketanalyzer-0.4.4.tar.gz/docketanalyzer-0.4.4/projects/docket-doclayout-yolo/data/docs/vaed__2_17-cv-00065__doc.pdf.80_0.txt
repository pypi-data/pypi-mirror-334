<line: 4> II. LEGAL STANDARDS

[TITLE]
<line: 6> A. Motion to Amend Fee Complaint

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Under Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court may grant a party leave
<line: 9> to amend its pleading either before or after trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15. Under rule 15(a) a party is
<line: 10> permitted to amend his or her complaint once as a matter of course within 21 days of serving the.
<line: 11> complaint, or after the 21 days by obtaining the consent of the opposing party or by requesting
<line: 12> leave of court to file an amended complaint. Id. In such situations, the Court should freely grant.
<line: 13> leave when justice so requires. Id. During or after trial, the Court may amend the complaint to.
<line: 14> address issues raised at trial, but not raised in the pleadings. Id.  Outside of these two instances,
<line: 15> the Court may also supplement a pleading to address events that occurred after the filing of the
<line: 16> pleading. Id.

[TITLE]
<line: 18> B. Motion for Attorney's Fees.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Once a court has determined that a party is entitled to attorney's fees, the court has
<line: 21> discretion to determine the amount of the award. J.D. ex rel. Davis v. Kanawha County Bd. Of
<line: 22> Educ., 571 F.3d 381, 387 (4th Cir. 2009). In determining what constitutes a reasonable fee, the
<line: 23> court starts by calculating the number of hours expended on the litigation multiplied by a
<line: 24> reasonable hourly rate. JP ex rel. Peterson y. County School Bd. Of Hanover County, Va., 641
<line: 25> F.Supp.2d 499, 512 (E.D. Va. 2009). The result of this calculation, called the "lodestar' figure,
<line: 26> will normally reflect a reasonable fee. Id. Determining the hourly rate will generally be the
<line: 27> critical inquiry in setting the reasonable fee. Robinson v. Equifax Info. Servs., LLC, 560 F.3d
<line: 28> 235, 244 (4th Cir. 2009). The burden rests with the fee applicant to establish the reasonableness
<line: 29> of a requested rate. Id. In addition to the attorney's own affidavits, the fee applicant must

[TEXT]
<line: 2> produce satisfactory specific evidence of the prevailing market rates in the relevant community
<line: 3> for the type of work for which he seeks an award. Id.; See also 20 U.S.C.A.  1415(i)(3)(C).
<line: 4> "To make this calculation, the [Clourt must necessarily exclude any hours that are excessive,
<line: 5> redundant, or otherwise unnecessary,' and therefore not reasonably expended on the
<line: 6> litigation." County School Bd of York County, Virginia v. A.L., 2007 WL 756586 at *6 (E.D.
<line: 7> Va. Mar. 6, 2007) (quoting Lilienthal v. City of Suffolk, 322 F.Supp.2d 667, 670 (E.D.Va.2004)
<line: 8> (citing Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434)).

[TEXT]
<line: 10> Additionally, the Court considers the following twelve Johnson v. Ga. Highway Express,.
<line: 11> Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974) factors in determining whether fees claimed are
<line: 12> reasonable:

[TEXT]
<line: 14> (1) the time and labor expended; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions
<line: 15> raised; (3) the skill required to properly perform the legal services rendered; (4).
<line: 16> the attorney's opportunity costs in pressing the instant litigation; (5) the customary.
<line: 17> fee for like work; (6) the attorney's expectations at the outset of the litigation; (7)
<line: 18> the time limitations imposed by the client or circumstances; (8) the amount in.
<line: 19> controversy and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation and ability of.
<line: 20> the attorney; (10) the undesirability of the case within the legal community in.
<line: 21> which the suit arose; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship
<line: 22> between attorney and client; and (12) attorney's fees awards in similar cases..

<line: 26> Under the IDEA, the court shall also reduce the amount of attorney's fee awarded.
<line: 27> whenever the court finds that the amount of attorney's fees otherwise authorized to be awarded
<line: 28> unreasonably exceeds the hourly rate prevailing in the community for similar services by
<line: 29> attorneys of reasonably comparable skill, reputation, and experience" or "the time spent and

<line: 2> III. ANALYSIS

[TITLE]
<line: 4> A. Motion to Amend Fee Complaint

[TEXT]
<line: 6> Plaintiff seeks to file an Amended Complaint that is identical to her Original Fee.
<line: 7> Complaint, but attaches an additional invoice for attorney's fees up through the present Motion
<line: 8> to Amend (the "Additional Invoice'). Doc. 78 at 1. However, Plaintiff failed to attach a
<line: 9> proposed Amended Complaint to her Motion to Amend. Doc. 78-1. Instead, she only attached
<line: 10> the Additional Invoice. Id.

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Defendant opposes Plaintiff's Motion to Amend, but does not contest Plaintiff filing the.
<line: 13> Additional Invoice for attorney's fees in support of her present Motion for Attorney's Fees,
<line: 14> which she filed March 5, 2018. Doc. 79; See Doc. 72.

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Plaintiff's reliance on Rule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as a basis for.
<line: 17> this Court to freely grant leave for her to amend her complaint is misplaced under the present
<line: 18> circumstances. Rule 15(a)(2) refers to amending a complaint prior to trial and Plaintiff seeks a
<line: 19> post-trial amendment. Further, even if Plaintiff had cited an appropriate basis for the Court to.
<line: 20> grant her leave to amend her complaint, Plaintiff failed to attach her proposed Amended
<line: 21> Complaint, which is also a sufficient basis to deny a Motion for Leave to File an Amended
<line: 22> Complaint. See Williams v. Wilkerson, 90 F.R.D. 168, 170 (E.D. Va. 1981). Additionally, it is
<line: 23> unclear whether Plaintiff is seeking to amend the original Complaint, which was filed January
<line: 24> 27, 2018, or the Amended Complaint, which was filed on May 22, 2017. Therefore, the Court
<line: 25> DENIEs Plaintiff's Motion to Amend. However, given Defendant's stipulation to include
<line: 26> Plaintiff's Additional Invoice, Doc. 78-1, as an attachment to the present Motion for Attorney's
<line: 27> Fees, the Court will consider the Additional Invoice along with the invoices submitted in support
<line: 28> of Plaintiff's Motion for Attorney's Fees, Doc. 72

[ABANDON]

[TITLE]
<line: 2> B. Motion for Attorney's Fees

[TEXT]
<line: 4> In support of her Motion for Attorney's Fees, Plaintiff attaches her invoices from the start
<line: 5> of the Due Process action with the City of Virginia Beach and includes her invoices up through
<line: 6> the resolution of the present Motions. Doc. 72-1. Because the Court has allowed Plaintiff to.
<line: 7> supplement her Motion for Attorney's Fees with the invoice attached to her Motion to Amend,
<line: 8> Plaintiff's total Motion for Attorney's Fees and Costs seeks an award of $81,008.74. See Docs.
<line: 9> 72-1, 78-1. This amount represents the sum of $78,760 in attorney's fees and $2248.74 in
<line: 10> litigation expenses and costs. Plaintiff's invoices provide two separate hourly rates. From April
<line: 11> 20, 2016 until July 19, 2017, Plaintiff's invoices reflect an hourly rate of $250 per hour. The.
<line: 12> amount of fees charged at the rate of $250 per hour totals $60,775, which accounts for 243.1
<line: 13> hours of legal services billed at this rate. From July 20, 2017 until April 5, 2018, Plaintiff's
<line: 14> invoices reflect an hourly rate of $275 per hour. The total amount of fees charged at $275 per.
<line: 15> hour totals $17,985, which accounts for 65.4 hours of legal services billed at this rate

[TEXT]
<line: 17> Plaintiff's billing entries fall under the categories of "Phone Conference" "Meeting'
<line: 18> "Research "Drafting" "Receipt/Review" "Prepare" and "Hearing."The hours claimed in.

<line: 22> i. Reasonable Hourly Rate

[TEXT]
<line: 24> The burden rests with the fee applicant to establish the reasonableness of a requested rate..
<line: 25> Robinson, 560 F.3d at 244. In addition to the attorney's own affidavits, the fee applicant must
<line: 26> produce satisfactory specific evidence of the prevailing market rates in the relevant community
<line: 27> for the type of work for which he seeks an award. Id.; See also 20 U.S.C.A.  1415(i)(3)(C)

[TEXT]
<line: 29> Defendant does not contest that Plaintiff is the prevailing party or that Plaintiff's fee of
<line: 30> $250 per hour is reasonable. However, Defendant asks this Court to reject Plaintiff's increased
<line: 31> hourly rate from $250 to $275 in attorney's fees, because Plaintiff offered no justification for
<line: 32> increasing her rate. Id. at 4.

[TEXT]
<line: 34> Plaintiff's present Motion for Attorney's Fees is the first time that Plaintiff has provided
<line: 35> invoices that list hourly rates and time expended for services in the present litigation. However,
<line: 36> in her present Motion for Attorney's Fees, Plaintiff failed to attach any affidavits in support of
<line: 37> the reasonableness of her increased hourly rate as required under case law. Even when

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Defendant challenged Plaintiff's rate of $275, Plaintiff's only reply was that "$275.00 per hour is
<line: 3> still well-within the prevailing rate according to the Lodestar and Johnson factors stated above
<line: 4> and the attorney's fees affidavits that were submitted as exhibits to the Complaint filed by M.N.
<line: 5> on January 27, 2017 and subsequent amendments."' Doc. 77 at 8. Plaintiff filed an Amended
<line: 6> Complaint and attorney affidavits in support of her Complaint for Attorney's Fees on May 22,
<line: 7> 2017; however, Plaintiff increased her rate from $250 to $275 on July 20, 2017. While the
<line: 8> increase is fairly nominal, the Court FINDS that the $250 per hour rate is the reasonable rate
<line: 9> because it is the rate Plaintiff's counsel was charging at the time Plaintiff obtained her attorney
<line: 10> affidavits. With the 65.4 hours currently charged at a rate of $275 reduced to $250 per hour, the
<line: 11> total amount of attorney's fees claimed for these hours are reduced from $17,985 to $16,350 (a
<line: 12> reduction of $1635).

[TITLE]
<line: 14> ii. Reductions for Non-Legal or Clerical Work

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Under Johnson, it is important to distinguish between legal work and clerical work,
<line: 17> because a lesser rate may apply to clerical and administrative functions. See Johnson, 488 F.2d
<line: 18> at 717. Defendant seeks a modest reduction for hours billed in Plaintiff's invoices which
<line: 19> Defendant claims are for non-legal or clerical work or otherwise impermissibly lump legal and
<line: 20> non-legal work. Doc. 76 at 1-2. Defendant argues that the following 21.90 hours of Plaintiff's
<line: 21> invoices qualify as clerical/non-legal work. Id. Those amounts are itemized below:

[TEXT]
<line: 34> The Court FINDS that the tasks identified by Defendant seem to fit within the category of
<line: 35> clerical/non-legal work. Therefore, the Court REDUCEs Plaintiff's fees for the amounts
<line: 36> itemized, with the exception of part of the time that counsel spent reviewing the exhibit book.
<line: 37> Because Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to include certain exhibits in their joint exhibit
<line: 38> book, which resulted in Plaintiff having to review the book for accuracy; the Court REDUCES
<line: 39> the number of hours spent reviewing the exhibit book by 50% instead of completely deducting

[ABANDON]
<line: 41> 2 Plaintiff alleges that she had to review the exhibit book thoroughly because Defendant omitted certain.
<line: 42> documents from the exhibit book. Id. In support of Plaintiff's argument, Plaintiff submitted e-mail

[TITLE]
<line: 5> iii. Reductions for Hours Unreasonably Expended.

[TEXT]
<line: 7> Defendant also asks this Court to reduce Plaintiff's attorney's fees by 6.2 hours for the
<line: 8> time Plaintiff spent drafting and preparing her Motion to Show Cause. Id. at 5-6. On September
<line: 9> 13, 2017, this Court ORDERED Defendant to make payments to Plaintiff within fifteen (15)
<line: 10> days of receipt of notice of costs paid. Doc. 51 at 6. Plaintiff filed her Motion to Show Cause on
<line: 11> October 17, 2017 because she submitted receipts to Defendant on September 20, 2017, but
<line: 12> Defendant did not remit payment within fifteen (15) days. See Doc. 67 at 1. Defendant failed to
<line: 13> pay on time due to a miscommunication within its office, but remedied the issue by providing
<line: 14> payment for the September receipts on October 18, 2017 and making an early payment of the
<line: 15> October fees. Id. at 2. Therefore, the Court DENIED Plaintiff's Motion to Show Cause because
<line: 16> it found that Plaintiff did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that she suffered harm.
<line: 17> Id.

[TEXT]
<line: 19> Defendant argues that the time spent on Plaintiff's Motion to Show Cause was not.
<line: 20> reasonably expended because it would not have been necessary for Plaintiff's counsel to file the
<line: 21> Motion to Show Cause if she had conferred with Defense counsel prior to drafting and filing it.
<line: 22> Id. at 6. Plaintiff does not dispute that she failed to confer with Defense counsel prior to filing
<line: 23> the Motion to Show Cause, but argues that the Motion to Show Cause was warranted in light of
<line: 24> Plaintiff's issues with Defendant's failure to remit payment in the year and a half prior to filing
<line: 25> the Motion to Show Cause. Doc. 77 at 7.

[TEXT]
<line: 27> The fact that Defendant quickly remedied the issue once the Motion to Show Cause was
<line: 28> filed and remitted an early payment for the following month weighs against Plaintiff's contention

[ABANDON]
<line: 30> 10

[TEXT]
<line: 2> that this issue could not be remedied by a phone call to Defendant. Therefore, the Court
<line: 3> REDUCEs Plaintiff's fees by the time spent drafting and filing the Motion to Show Cause,
<line: 4> which results in a reduction of $1,550.

[TEXT]
<line: 6> Defendant also contends that the Court should reduce Plaintiff's attorney's fees by
<line: 7> $357.50 for the 1.3 hours Plaintiff spent drafting her Motion to Amend her Fee Complaint.
<line: 8> because filing the Motion to Amend was not necessary. The Court agrees with Defendant's.
<line: 9> argument for the reasons stated in the portion of this Order that addresses Plaintiff's Motion to
<line: 10> Amend. Accordingly, the Court REDUCEs Plaintiff's fees by $357.50 for the time spent
<line: 11> drafting her Motion to Amend.

[TITLE]
<line: 13> iv. Other areas of reduction

[TITLE]
<line: 15> a. Excessive Legal Services Rendered

[TEXT]
<line: 17> Under the IDEA, the court is also instructed to reduce attorney's fees if "the time spent
<line: 18> and legal services furnished were excessive considering the nature of the action or proceeding."
<line: 19> 20 U.S.C.A. 1415(i)(3)(F). While Plaintiff's case was by no means simple, Plaintiff's counsel.
<line: 20> charged 129 hours of legal services for drafting legal documents or conducting research.
<line: 21> However, Plaintiff's counsel submitted briefs that were disorganized, often lacked key citations,
<line: 22> frequently offered conclusory analysis, and were largely unhelpful in reviewing the Hearing
<line: 23> Officer's decision. Though she did cite more case law in her reply, Plaintiff's initial Motion for
<line: 24> Attorney's Fees did not cite much case law in support of the reasonableness of the rate requested
<line: 25> for her award of attorney's fees.

[TEXT]
<line: 27> Additionally, Plaintiff failed to attach any affidavits in support of the reasonableness of
<line: 28> her hourly rate as required under case law in support of her present Motion for Attorney's Fees.

[ABANDON]
<line: 30> 3 The Court notes that these affidavits were attached to Plaintiff's initial complaint for attorney's fees;.
<line: 31> however, Plaintiff did not file these affidavits along with the invoices that she submitted in the present.

[ABANDON]
<line: 33> 11

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Defendants conceded that Plaintiff's hourly rate of $250 is reasonable; however, this supports the
<line: 3> Court's sentiments. In order to find the affidavits counsel referred to in her Motion for
<line: 4> Attorney's Fees and Reply, the Court had to go back and comb through the attachments to the
<line: 5> filings in her prior Complaints. Doc. 11.

[TITLE]
<line: 10> b. Duplicative and Excessive Expenses and Costs

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Defendant raises no objections to the expenses and costs alleged by Plaintiff. However,.
<line: 13> there are a few expenses claimed on Plaintiff's invoices that appear to be either duplicative or.
<line: 14> excessive. For example, on July 20, 2016, Plaintiff recorded expenses in the amount of $36.88
<line: 15> for "Gas for drive back to FFX", $41.39 for "Gas for drive to VBCPS", and $223.56 for
<line: 16> "Mileage at IRS tax rate (414 miles at .54/mile)." Doc. 72-1 at 5. Therefore, it appears that
<line: 17> Plaintiff attributed expenses to both her actual gas expenses and the IRS standard mileage for the.
<line: 18> July 20, 2016 travel. Additionally, on September 19, 2016, Plaintiff lists an expense of $363.97.
<line: 19> for "Elite - trial binder with exhibits VBCPS failed to include in joint exhibit book." Doc. 72-1
<line: 20> at 5. It is unclear what this expense is for. The expense seems to be describing the purchase of a.
<line: 21> "trial binder' however; $363.07 seems highly excessive for a trial binder. Therefore, the Court
<line: 22> strikes the amount claimed for counsel's IRS mileage for the July 20, 2016 travel as duplicative
<line: 23> The Court also strikes the amount claimed for the "Elite trial binder" cost because this cost
<line: 24> appears excessive. Striking each of these amounts results in a reduction of $587.53.
