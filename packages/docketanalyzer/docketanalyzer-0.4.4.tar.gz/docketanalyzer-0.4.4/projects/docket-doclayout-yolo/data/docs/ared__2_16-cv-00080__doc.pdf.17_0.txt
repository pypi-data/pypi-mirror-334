<line: 21> OPINION AND ORDER

[TEXT]
<line: 23> ARcare brings this action on behalf of itself and others similarly situated for damages and
<line: 24> injunctive relief under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (“TCPA”).  47 U.S.C.
<line: 25> § 227(b)(3).  With three exceptions, the TCPA prohibits any person from using a telephone facsimile
<line: 26> machine to send an unsolicited advertisement.  ARcare alleges that IMS Health, Inc. sent at least six
<line: 27> unsolicited advertisements to ARcare’s ink-and-paper facsimile machine.  IMS Health has filed a
<line: 28> motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), contending that the faxes
<line: 29> it sent to ARcare, which are attached to the complaint, are not “advertisements.”  If the faxes are not
<line: 30> “advertisements,” within the meaning of the TCPA, then the complaint fails to state a claim upon
<line: 31> which relief can be granted.  The faxes are not “advertisements,” as the law has defined the term for
<line: 32> purposes of the TCPA.  Therefore, for the following reasons, the motion to dismiss is granted.

[TITLE]
<line: 34> I.

[TEXT]
<line: 36> The complaint alleges that ARcare is a non-profit corporation, which owns the Parkin Drug
<line: 37> Store and the Bald Knob Medical Clinic.  IMS Health is a Connecticut corporation that provides
<line: 38> global information and technology services that help improve performance and protect patient
<line: 39> privacy.  IMS Health owns Healthcare Data Solutions.

<line: 41> IMS Health sent an unsolicited fax to ARcare on May 11, 2015.  Document #1 at 11.  The
<line: 42> fax features the Healthcare Data Solutions logo and states in part:1231231

<line: 4> Healthcare Data Solutions (HDS) works with pharmacies and prescribers to ensure
<line: 5> the confidential exchange and confirmation of patient information.  We want to

<line: 10> Id.  The fax then asks the recipient to verify the practice’s address, phone number, fax number,
<line: 11> office manager, and website; the identity of the medial professional who provides services at the
<line: 12> practice; and the direct fax number for that medical professional.  Id.  The fax provides a space for
<line: 13> a signature, where the recipient can affirm that the information provided is true and correct.  Id.  The
<line: 14> fax also provides a box, where the recipient can check if he has additional information or would
<line: 15> rather receive a phone call from a Healthcare Data Solutions representative.  Id.  ARcare attached
<line: 16> five other faxes to the complaint. The faxes were sent on March 21, April 19, April 20, May 13, and
<line: 17> June 15, 2015, and vary only by the practice and the professional.  Document #1 at 13-17.

<line: 21> To survive a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a complaint
<line: 22> must contain “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” 
<line: 23> Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  Although detailed factual allegations are not required, the complaint must
<line: 24> set forth “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v.
<line: 25> Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007).  “A claim has facial
<line: 26> plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable
<line: 27> inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,
<line: 28> 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009).  The Court accepts as true all of the factual
<line: 29> allegations contained in the complaint and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving
<line: 30> party. Gorog v. Best Buy Co., Inc., 760 F.3d 787, 792 (8th Cir. 2014).  The complaint must contain

[TEXT]
<line: 11> IMS Health maintains that the faxes it sent to ARcare and other entities are not
<line: 12> “advertisements” as that term is defined by applicable law because they do not promote goods or
<line: 13> services that are for sale to the fax recipients; rather, they seek to verify the recipients’ contact
<line: 14> information.  Document #11 at 5.  ARcare, on the other hand, maintains that the faxes are
<line: 15> advertisements because they promote IMS Health’s pharmacy compliance services.  Document #15
<line: 16> at 1.  ARcare explains: “Defendant’s faxes do not seek merely to verify [ARcare’s] contact
<line: 17> information.  Rather, they are sent to generate business and maximize [IMS Health’s] profit motive. 
<line: 18> Ostensibly, the faxes offer a free service: An evaluation of Plaintiff’s fax number to ensure it
<line: 19> complies with the various regulatory standards.”  Id. (citing 21 F.C.C.R. 3787, 3814 (2006)).

[TEXT]
<line: 21> The TCPA, as amended by the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005, makes it unlawful for any
<line: 22> person to use a telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device to send, to a telephone
<line: 23> facsimile machine, an unsolicited advertisement, except under limited circumstances that are not
<line: 24> relevant to IMS Health’s motion to dismiss.  47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1).  “The term ‘unsolicited
<line: 25> advertisement’1 means any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any

<line: 27> 1 The Sixth Circuit addressed the question of law presented to this Court–whether a certain
<line: 28> fax is an “advertisement”–for the first time in Sandusky Wellness Ctr. v. Medco Health Solutions,
<line: 29> 788 F.3d 218, 221 (6th Cir. 2015).  The court clarified the statutory definition: “We can glean a few
<line: 30> things from [the statutory] definition.  For one thing, we know the fax must advertise something. 
<line: 31> Advertising is ‘[t]he action of drawing the public’s attention to something to promote its sale.

<line: 4> property, goods, or services which is transmitted to any person without that person’s prior express
<line: 5> invitation or permission, in writing or otherwise.”  47 U.S.C. § 227(a)(5).  Congress gave the Federal
<line: 6> Communications Commission authority to make regulations to implement the TCPA.  47 U.S.C. §
<line: 7> 227(b)(2).  These regulations explain what constitutes an “advertisement” by illustrating the types
<line: 8> of faxes that violate the statute.  See In the Matter of Rules & Regulations Implementing the Tel.
<line: 9> Consumer Prot. Act of 1991 Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005, 21 F.C.C.R. 3787, 3810-15 (2006). 
<line: 10> For example, “facsimile messages that promote goods or services even at no cost, such as free
<line: 11> magazine subscriptions, catalogs, or free consultations or seminars, are unsolicited advertisements
<line: 12> under the TCPA’s definition.”2  Id. at 3814.

[TEXT]
<line: 14> In Ameriguard, Inc. v. Univ. of Kansas Med. Ctr., the court held that a fax seeking
<line: 15> participants in a clinical research trial for “prevention of diabetes” was not an “advertisement” and
<line: 16> dismissed the action for failure to state a claim.  No. 06-0369-CV-W-ODS, 2006 WL 1766812 at
<line: 17> *1 (W.D. Mo. June 23, 2006) (aff’d Ameriguard, Inc. v. Univ. of Kansas Med. Ctr., 222 Fed. Appx.
<line: 18> 530, 531 (8th Cir. 2007)).  The fax discussed general information about diabetes; announced the
<line: 19> clinical research trial; provided that qualified participants would receive study-related medical care,

[ABANDON]
<line: 21> Black’s Law Dictionary 65 (10th ed. 2014) . . . . So material that advertises something promotes it
<line: 22> to the public as for sale.  For another thing, we know that what’s advertised–here, the ‘availability
<line: 23> or qualify of any property, goods, or services’–must be commercial in nature.  Commercial means
<line: 24> ‘of, in, or relating to commerce’; ‘from the point of view of profit: having profit as the primary aim.’ 
<line: 25> Webster’s Third at 456 . . . . So to be an ad, the fax must promote goods or services to be bought or
<line: 26> sole, and it should have profit as an aim.”  Id. at 220-21.

[ABANDON]
<line: 28> 2 There is a circuit split as to the level of Chevron deference courts must afford the FCC’s
<line: 29> regulations implementing the TCPA.  See Sandusky, 788 F.3d at 223.  Courts disagree as to whether
<line: 30> the statutory definition of “unsolicited advertisement” is ambiguous.  Id.  ARcare uses the FCC
<line: 31> regulations to bolster its argument.  Neither party raises the issue of deference and the regulations
<line: 32> do not support a finding that the Healthcare Data Solutions faxes are advertisements.  Therefore, the
<line: 33> Court need not decide the level of deference warranted.

<line: 4> study medication, and counseling at no cost; provided that travel would be compensated; and
<line: 5> provided a section for the recipient to provide contact information.  Id.  The plaintiff argued that
<line: 6> inviting people to obtain information about diabetes prevention qualified as “commercial
<line: 7> availability” of the defendant’s goods.  Id. at *2.  The court disagreed: “First, the Complaint does
<line: 8> not allege Defendant makes ‘information about diabetes prevention’ commercially available (as
<line: 9> opposed to simply delivering it to people), nor does it allege Defendant sells medication directly to
<line: 10> the public.  Second, there is no suggestion that defendant included the call for volunteers as a
<line: 11> smokescreen to mask a true purpose of engaging in the commercial activity of providing or selling
<line: 12> medicine.”  Compare id., and Ira Holtzman, C.P.A. v. Turza, 728 F.3d 682, 686 (7th Cir. 2013)
<line: 13> (holding that fax devoting 75 percent of its space to mundane advice and the remainder to a lawyer’s
<line: 14> logo, name, address, and specialties was an advertisement);3 Physicians Healthsource, Inc. v.
<line: 15> Express Scripts Serv. Co., No. 4:15-CV-664 JAR, 2016 WL 1246884 at *2 (E.D. Mo. March 30,
<line: 16> 2016) (holding that a fax describing the availability of the defendant’s goods and services was an
<line: 17> advertisement).

[TEXT]
<line: 19> Accepting the complaint’s allegations as true and drawing all inferences in ARcare’s favor,
<line: 20> the Court concludes that the faxes in dispute are non-commercial messages that fall outside that

[ABANDON]
<line: 22> 3 In Holtzman, the Seventh Circuit based its holding in part on the fact that the “plug for
<line: 23> Turza’s services was not incidental to a message that would have been sent anyway; promotion or
<line: 24> marketing was the reason the faxes were transmitted.”  728 F.3d at 688.  Turza’s own lawyer called
<line: 25> the faxes “promotional device[s]” during oral argument.  Id. at 687.  Likewise, in Paldo Sign,
<line: 26> another case on which ARcare relies, the sender of the fax acknowledged that its purpose was to
<line: 27> direct traffic to a database of industrial real estate listings owned and managed by the sender.  Paldo
<line: 28> Sign and Display Co. v. Wagener Equities, Inc., 67 F. Supp. 3d 874, 881 (N.D. Ill. 2014).  Here,
<line: 29> IMS Health has not identified promotion of its services as the fax’s purpose and ARcare has failed
<line: 30> to allege facts upon which the Court can reasonably infer the fax was intended to promote the
<line: 31> commercial availability of IMS Health’s services.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> TCPA’s ban on unsolicited advertisements.  Here, the fax is not a direct commercial solicitation and
<line: 5> like in Ameriguard, the plaintiff–ARcare–has failed to allege facts from which the Court reasonably
<line: 6> could infer that the fax it received was either an indirect commercial solicitation or a pretext for a
<line: 7> commercial solicitation.  ARcare argues that considering the different components of fax
<line: 8> together–the prominence of the logo, address, and phone number, the description of Healthcare Data
<line: 9> Solutions, and the offer to verify the fax number and practice information–the fax “inform[s] the
<line: 10> recipient that Defendant’s pharmacy compliance services are commercially available.”  Document
<line: 11> #15 at 5.  But ARcare does not allege, nor does the fax indicate where or how this category of
<line: 12> services is available for purchase by the fax recipient.  See, e.g., Physicians Healthsource, Inc. v.
<line: 13> Janssen Pharm., Inc., No. 12-2132 (FLW), 2013 WL 486207 at *4 (D. N.J. Feb. 6, 2013) (“[T]he
<line: 14> inquiry under the TCPA is whether the content of the message is commercial, not what predictions
<line: 15> can be made about future economic benefits.”). ARcare only broadly alleges that “Defendant IMS
<line: 16> Health Inc. is a Connecticut entity that features global information and technology services that help
<line: 17> improve performance and protect patient privacy.”4  Document #1 at 2, ¶10.  And the fax contains
<line: 18> one sentence vaguely describing Healthcare Data Solutions.  Document #1 at 11.  What, if any,
<line: 19> services are commercially available to ARcare is unclear.

[ABANDON]
<line: 21> 4 In ARcare’s response in opposition to IMS Health’s motion to dismiss, ARcare asks the
<line: 22> Court to look to IMS Health’s website as corroboration for its assertion that IMS Health intends to
<line: 23> use its faxes to generate market awareness and sales for its pharmacy compliance services. 
<line: 24> Document #15 at 6-7.  But in deciding this motion to dismiss, the Court is limited to the complaint
<line: 25> and materials necessarily embraced by the pleadings, such as the faxes ARcare attached to its
<line: 26> complaint.  The cases ARcare cites in support of its suggestion involve motions for summary
<line: 27> judgment, materials the plaintiff attached to his complaint, or a court’s decision not to look outside
<line: 28> the fax and the complaint but reconsider the issue at the summary judgment stage.  See Document
<line: 29> #15 at 6.

<line: 4> It is true that “a fax that does not on its face promote a product or service may nonetheless
<line: 5> violate the TCPA if it is a precursor for a future solicitation.”  Drug Reform Coordination Net v.
<line: 6> Grey House Pub. 106 F. Supp. 3d 9, 13 (D.D.C. 2013) (holding that a fax that was not an unsolicited
<line: 7> advertisement on its face was nonetheless an advertisement because three direct solicitation e-mails
<line: 8> followed).  But ARcare does not allege that IMS Health wanted to verify that the recipients’ fax
<line: 9> numbers as a prelude to later solicitations to purchase its services.  See Drug Reform Coordination
<line: 10> Network, Inc. v. Grey House Publ’g, Inc., 106 F. Supp. 3d 9, 13 (D.D.C. 2015) (“Standing alone,
<line: 11> the Fax does not promote the Directory for sale.  Rather, it apprised Plaintiff of the Directory’s
<line: 12> upcoming edition and offered the opportunity to update Plaintiff’s ‘free listing’ so that its contact
<line: 13> information would be accurate . . . . But a different conclusion obtains when the Fax is read together
<line: 14> with the three direct solicitation e-mails that followed”, which offered the Directory for sale for
<line: 15> $289).  Phillips Randolph v. Adler-Weiner Research Chicago, 526 F. Supp. 2d 851 (N.D. Ill. 2007).

[TEXT]
<line: 17> ARcare does not even speculate in its complaint that the fax was part of IMS Health’s
<line: 18> operations to market its services, or that the fax would be followed by a commercial solicitation for
<line: 19> the recipient to purchase services from IMS Health.  See Physicians Healthsource, Inc. v.
<line: 20> Boehringer Ingelheim Pharm., Inc., No. 3:14-cv-405 (SRU), 2015 WL 144728 at *5 (D. Conn. Jan.
<line: 21> 12, 2015).  And nothing in the fax itself suggests that verifying the recipient’s fax number and
<line: 22> information about the practice was a pretext for pitching a particular service.  Ameriguard, 2006 WL
<line: 23> 1766812 at *2.  “The fact that the sender might gain an ancillary, remote, and hypothetical economic
<line: 24> benefit later on does not convert a noncommercial, information communication into a commercial
<line: 25> solicitation.”  Sandusky, 788 F.3d at 225.  The message–please verify your contact information and
