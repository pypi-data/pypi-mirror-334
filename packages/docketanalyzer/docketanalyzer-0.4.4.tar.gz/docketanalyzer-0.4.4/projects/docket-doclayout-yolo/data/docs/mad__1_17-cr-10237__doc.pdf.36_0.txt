[TEXT]
<line: 25> 1.
<line: 26> For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C.s 3663A,restitution is not ordered because
<line: 27> the number of identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C.s 3663A(c)(3)(A).
<line: 28> 2.
<line: 29> For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C.s 3663A, restitution is not ordered because
<line: 30> determining complex issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims' losses would complicate
<line: 31> or prolong the sentencing process to a degree that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed
<line: 32> by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. 3663A(c)(3)(B).
<line: 33> 3.
<line: 34> For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C.$ 3663 and/or required by the sentencing
<line: 35> guidelines, restitution is not ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting
<line: 36> from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. S

<line: 46> Restitution is not ordered for other reasons. (Explain)
