<line: 18> Plaintiffs, by and through their counsel, bring this Master Long Form Complaint'.
<line: 19> against Defendants Zimmer, Inc., Zimmer Holdings, Inc., and Zimmer Orthopaedic
<line: 20> Surgical Products, Inc. (alternatively referred to as *"Defendants'). This Master Long.
<line: 21> Form Complaint sets forth questions of fact and law common to those claims subsumed
<line: 22> within the context of this multidistrict proceeding. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and
<line: 23> punitive damages, monetary restitution, equitable relief, and all other available remedies
<line: 24> as a result of injuries incurred by Defendants' defective products. Plaintiffs make the
<line: 25> following allegations based upon their personal knowledge and upon information and
<line: 26> belief, as well as upon their attorneys' investigative efforts, regarding the Zimmer
<line: 27> NexGen Flex Knee system.

<line: 16> BACKGROUND

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 1.
<line: 19> The human knee is a miracle of nature that supports the entire body weight.
<line: 20> on four small surfaces through a variety of motions essential to everyday life. It is also
<line: 21> the joint most susceptible to arthritis among all such joints.

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 2.
<line: 24> With the increases in life expectancy in the 20th Century, people began to
<line: 25> suffer pain and disability from knee joint arthritis at historic rates. Knee replacement
<line: 26> technology can provide a surgical solution to the pain and restore basic function. Knee
<line: 27> replacement designs approved in the 1990s met the goals of reducing pain and restoring
<line: 28> function with low failure rates.

[TEXT]
<line: 30> 3.
<line: 31> Despite the safety and efficacy success related to earlier knee replacement
<line: 32> models, Zirmmer began to tinker with the original design in an effort to replicate the total
<line: 33>  flexion of the natural knee.

[TEXT]
<line: 35> 4.
<line: 36> Of course, the replacement knees using artificial structures of metal and.
<line: 37> plastic can in no way replicate the capabilities of the natural knee..

<line: 39> 5.
<line: 40> Nevertheless, with a series of new introductions to the knee replacement
<line: 41> market, Zimmer unveiled the Zimmer NexGen Flex Knee:system. and procedures,

<line: 11> 9.
<line: 12> Zimmer first introduced its Zimmer NexGen.Complete Knee Solutions
<line: 13> system in 1995. Zimmer's original design, like the vast majority of other products on the
<line: 14>  market at the time, offered a device promising standard flexion up to one-hundred-twenty
<line: 15> degrees (120). In an effort to expand its market share, however, Zimmer began to tinker
<line: 16> with its knee design to create a device providing flexion up.to one-hundred fifty-five
<line: 17> degrees (155) -- the amount of relative flexion available in an anatomical human knee.
<line: 18> By 1999 Zimmer was ready to take its product to market.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> 10.
<line: 21>  Specifically, in 1999, Zimmer received approval for the high-flex version
<line: 22> (the LPS-Flex) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA") under the "510k"
<line: 23> protocol. The basis for FDA approval was substantial similarity to a prior device,
<line: 24> resulting in very limited, if any, testing of the product.

[TEXT]
<line: 26> 11.
<line: 27> Over the next decade, Zimmer continued to expand its high-flex product
<line: 28> line under the auspices the high-flex product line would provide .patients who were
<line: 29> "expecting to maintain an active lifestyle" a more life-like knee. Zimmer aggressively
<line: 30> marketed its high-flex product line and became the dominant player in the so-called high-
<line: 31> flex market.

[TEXT]
<line: 33> By 2010, the efficacy and safety of Zimmer's high flex knee family
<line: 34> became the subject of much doubt within the peer reviewed medical literature.

[TEXT]
<line: 36> 13.
<line: 37>  By June of 2010, Zimmer's high flex knees were called into question in a
<line: 38> New York Times expose story, concerning Zimmer's abandonment and criticism of its

<line: 16>  Like the failed high-flex components, the other component at issue within
<line: 17> this litigation within the Zimmer NexGen Flex Knee family of replacement knee
<line: 18> products involves its failed MIs Stemmed Tibial components: and corresponding
<line: 19> "Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedure ("MIS").

[TEXT]
<line: 21> 16.
<line: 22> In March 2005, Zimmer received 510(k) FDA approval for the NexGen
<line: 23> MIS Tibial components that are part of the NexGen system. The low profile design of
<line: 24> this tibial component was developed and manufactured by Zimmer with the goal of
<line: 25> allowing for implantation and assembly in minimally invasive knee replacement
<line: 26> surgeries.

[TEXT]
<line: 28> 17.
<line: 29>  In September of 2010, the FDA recalled over 68,000 MIS Stemmed Tibial
<line: 30> components citing alarming failure rates. The MIs Stem and its corresponding MIS
<line: 31> surgical procedure, was designed to be assembled within the patient thereby allowing for
<line: 32> minimally invasive surgery technique (i.e., a much smaller incision). The NexGen MIS
<line: 33> Tibial component is marketed and promoted as compatible with the LPS-Flex and CR-
<line: 34> Flex femoral components and they are often used together..

[TEXT]
<line: 36> 18.
<line: 37>  Plaintiffs allege that the NexGen high-flex knee implants are defective and
<line: 38> as a result has caused unnecessary injury. Specifically, the high-flex device has a higher
<line: 39> failure rate than the standard flex devices and the purported benefit of added flexion
<line: 40> simply does not exist. The high-flex devices are prematurely failing at a significant rate

<line: 29> ANATOMY OF THE KNEE

[TEXT]
<line: 31> 27.
<line: 32> From a lay perspective, the knee is a hinge joint where the ends of the
<line: 33>  thigh bone and the shin bone move principally in one plane like a hinge. However, the
<line: 34> actual function of this anatomy is much more complex, as the bones are not directly
<line: 35>  attached to each other but are held together by rope-like ligaments. Movement is created
<line: 36> by the action of muscles and tendons. The joint hinge bears weight directly on its
<line: 37> principal articulating surfaces which are made of specialized cartilage

[TEXT]
<line: 39> 28.
<line: 40> The knee is composed of three functional bones: the femur (thighbone),
<line: 41> tibia (shinbone) and patella (kneecap). The femur is the longest and strongest bone in the
<line: 42> body. The distal end (the lower end farthest from the center of the body) forms the upper
<line: 43> part of the knee. This distal end has double rounded knob-like projections (the

<line: 9> and the other on the lateral (outside) of the knee. These rounded.condyles articulate

<line: 13> 29.
<line: 14>  The femur and the tibia meet to form a pivotal hinge joint, permitting
<line: 15> flexion (decrease of the joint angle) and extension (increase of the. joint angle or
<line: 16> straightening) of the leg as well as slight medial and lateral rotation.

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 30.
<line: 19> The knee joint is protected in front by the patella (kneecap). The patella is
<line: 20> a mostly flat, oval shaped, sesamoid bone tapered toward the distal end. Sesamoid means
<line: 21> the bone is contained within a tendon in this case, the patellar.tendon.  The posterior or
<line: 22> back side, of the patella slides between the condyles of the femur and articulates with the
<line: 23> femur.

[TEXT]
<line: 25> 31.
<line: 26> The joint is cushioned by articular cartilage that.covers the ends of the
<line: 27> tibia and femur as well as the underside of the patella. The articular cartilage is linked to
<line: 28> the underlying bone by a complex geometric interlocking system, much like jigsaw
<line: 29> puzzle pieces. Bone and cartilage are not connected in any way other than a mechanical
<line: 30> connection, and are anatomically separate, with separate systems for growth, nutrition
<line: 31> and regeneration.

<line: 33> 32.
<line: 34>  Arthritis develops when the cartilage surface wears away creating

<line: 8> Basic Knee Anatomy.

[TEXT]
<line: 10> 39.  The principal movements of the knee joint are flexion (which is bending.
<line: 11> the knee), and extension (which is straightening the knee). Typically, a healthy knee has
<line: 12> the potential to bend to about 155 to 160 degrees. One limiting factor on flexion is the.
<line: 13> girth of the leg, so that the knee may not reach 155 degrees even though it is anatomically.
<line: 14> able to do so because the soft tissues of the thigh and calf hit each other. The healthy
<line: 15> knee can typically extend just beyond O degrees..

[TEXT]
<line: 17> 40.
<line: 18>  Most normal movements of everyday life such as walking, climbing and
<line: 19> descending stairs, getting out of a chair, getting in and out of a car, or stooping generally
<line: 20> require only up to 90 degrees of flexion. A modestly active person needs only about 95.
<line: 21> degrees of flexion to engage in normal activities of daily living..

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 41.
<line: 24> Infrequently, activities of daily living require up to 120 degrees of flexion,
<line: 25> for example, getting up off the floor, or getting out of a seat where the hip is lower than
<line: 26> the knee when seated.

[TEXT]
<line: 17> 43.
<line: 18> Total knee arthroplasty (TKA'), also called total knee replacement.
<line: 19> (TKR'), is a commonly performed medical procedure. The surgery is designed to help
<line: 20> relieve pain and improve joint function, generally in people with severe knee
<line: 21> degeneration due to arthritis or trauma.

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 44.
<line: 24> Knee replacement is the process of replacing the joint surfaces with
<line: 25> artificial materials. The replacement is not nearly as good as the original but it
<line: 26> redistributes weight and takes away the tissue causing inflammation and thus reduces
<line: 27> pain. Replacement requires a mechanical connection between the bones and the implant.
<line: 28> components, but this bonding is never as good as the natural bonding of cartilage to bone..

<line: 12> 45.  A total knee arthroplasty is a misnomer, in that it is not truly a total knee
<line: 13> replacement, but rather the resurfacing of damaged articular cartilage and bone surfaces.
<line: 14> The main goals of the procedure are: (1) to relieve pain caused by arthritis, (2) to restore.
<line: 15> range of motion, or the degrees of knee flexion and extension, and (3) to correct any
<line: 16> varus and valgus misalignment.

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 46.
<line: 19> A total knee replacement is usually considered when disease or injury
<line: 20> cause substantial damage to the surface of either bone or the underside of the patella.

<line: 9> The..TKA procedure .is done by separating.th
<line: 10> muscles. andligaments
<line: 11> around the knee to expose the inside of the joint. The ends of the femur and tibia are
<line: 12> removed or reduced as is often the underside of the patella.

[TEXT]
<line: 14> 48.  In total knee replacement surgery, the surface'of the femur is replaced
<line: 15> with a contoured metal component designed to fit the curve of the bone. The surface of
<line: 16> the tibia is typically replaced with a flat metal component-and.a'smooth plastic
<line: 17> component that serves as a replacement for cartilage. The undersurface of the patella may.
<line: 18> also be replaced with an implant made of plastic, or a combination of metal and plastic..

<line: 12> 54.
<line: 13>  The NexGen TKR was an integrated system combining a femoral.
<line: 14> component, a tibial component, a plastic articulating surface and a plastic replacement for.
<line: 15> the posterior surface of the patella. The surgeon had the option to saye.or remove the.
<line: 16> posterior cruciate ligament.

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 55.
<line: 19> With the NexGen CR (Cruciate Retaining) implant, the PCL is preserved.
<line: 20>  In the LPS (Legacy Posterior Stabilized) version the posterior cruciate ligament is.
<line: 21> sacrificed.

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 56.
<line: 24>  The LPS implant includes a raised surface with an internal post on the
<line: 25> tibial component that fits into a special notch on the femoral component.. .The post and
<line: 26>  notch work together to perform the function of the PCL: preventing the tibia from
<line: 27> moving too far backward.

[TEXT]
<line: 29> 57.
<line: 30>  The basic system was very successful with a low revision rate. The system
<line: 31> was able to achieve flexion up to between 120 and 130 degrees, depending on the patient.

<line: 9> While the standard NexGen CR (Cruciate Retaining) and'NexGen LPS
<line: 10> (Legacy Posterior Stabilized or cruciate sacrificing) produced excellent results and sales,
<line: 11> the push to increase market share or expand the market to younger more active patients.
<line: 12> caused sellers to design implants that could arguably provide more function or were more
<line: 13>  attractive to the consumers, whether the consumer was a patient, a hospital, a health
<line: 14> .
<line: 15> system or a surgeon..

[TEXT]
<line: 17> 62.
<line: 18>  The first step in that direction was the NexGen LPS Flex Fixed-Bearing
<line: 19> Knee was which got FDA 510k approval in 1999 and was introduced in 2001. The LPS-
<line: 20> Flex was designed to allow for a maximum flexion of 155 degrees.

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 63.
<line: 23>  The NexGen CR Flex followed in 2003, also allowed up to 155 degrees of
<line: 24> flexion.

[TEXT]
<line: 26> 64.
<line: 27>  In 2004, Zimmer launched its Minimally Invasive Solutions (MIS) Quad-
<line: 28> Sparing TKR Procedure. Whereas traditional TKR incisions are 8-12 inches, Zimmer's
<line: 29>  MIS incision is 3-5 inches and avoids cutting a portion of the quadriceps muscles and
<line: 30> tendon. The stated goals were less blood loss, less pain, a shorter hospital stay, and.
<line: 31> shorter rehabilitation. On the negative side, a smaller opening limited the surgeon's view
<line: 32> of the operative field, and required some specialized and smaller instruments and
<line: 33> components

[TEXT]
<line: 35> 65.
<line: 36>  In 2006, Zimmer launched Gender Solutions, a femoral component
<line: 37> designed specifically for women. Differences between traditional and Gender Solutions
<line: 38> Female (Gsr) implants include a thinner profile, contoured shape, and a difference angle
<line: 39> between the pelvis and the knee to more mimic the general anatomic differences between.
<line: 40> the female and male knee (other than size).

<line: 16> ZIMMER MARKETING OF NEXGEN KNEES

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 92.  With the introduction of the Insall knee described above and other basic
<line: 19> knee designs, the market became crowded with knee prostheses"that could reliably
<line: 20> eliminate pain and restore the ability to perform most daily functions with a low failure
<line: 21> rate.

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 93.
<line: 24> The only ways to increase market share was to either expand the patient
<line: 25>  base of those who receive implants (for example, younger more active patients) or offer
<line: 26> TKR with alleged enhancements such as more function, shorter recovery times or
<line: 27> prostheses designed to gender specifications.

[TEXT]
<line: 29> 94.
<line: 30> Called in some publications "premium knees", the new designs were more
<line: 31> expensive but at the same time more attractive to many patients and surgeons. Zimmer
<line: 32> took the lead in this area with 3 different enhancements. The basic NexGen LPS and CR
<line: 33>  knees were redesigned so they had the potential to flex a full 155 degrees.

[TEXT]
<line: 35> 95.
<line: 36> The minimally invasive surgery, or MIS (Minimally Invasive Solutions),
<line: 37> promised a quicker exit from the hospital and quicker recovery.

[TEXT]
<line: 39> 96.
<line: 40> The "Gender Solutions" knee, all of which' were flex knees, were
<line: 41> redesigns of the standard CR and LPS, but shaped slightly different to mimic the typical.
<line: 42>  anatomical differences between a male and female knee.

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 100.  Zimmer actively marketed to doctors and the public that the Zimmer
<line: 23> Devices were safe and effective total knee prosthesis.

[TEXT]
<line: 25> 101. The Zimmer NexGen Flex Knee, defined as including the Zimmer LPS.
<line: 26> FIex, CR-Flex, LPS-Flex (GSF), CR-Flex (GSF) and/or MIS Tibial Components and any.
<line: 27>  and all other Zimmer high-flexion knee systems and/or components predicated directly or
<line: 28> indirectly upon the LPs-Flex Fixed Bearing Knee were aggressively marketed and
<line: 29> promoted to the more active population, including Plaintiffs herein, promising state-of-art
<line: 30> knee replacement providing greater flexion up to 155 degrees, and allowing for
<line: 31> minimally invasive knee replacement.

[TEXT]
<line: 33> 102. Zimmer stated that the Flex Fixed Knee replacement was the first knee
<line: 34> specifically designed to safely accommodate flexion of up to 155 degrees.

[TEXT]
<line: 36> 103.  This information is part of a public awareness campaign by Zimmer,
<line: 37> known as "Keeping pace with life," designed to educate patients about the Flex Fixed
<line: 38> Knee as an option for total knee replacement.

<line: 6> 104. The-stated campaign goal is to provide-patients-with-information and
<line: 7>  insight into the leading edge treatment for joint replacements to help them make educated.
<line: 8> decisions about their course of treatment.

[TEXT]
<line: 10> 105.  In the US, Zimmer has aggressively marketed/its high-flex versions as
<line: 11> specifically designed for younger and more active total knee replacement patients
<line: 12> "expecting to maintain an active lifestyle".

[TEXT]
<line: 14> 106. In marketing materials touting its NexGen flex products, Zimmer
<line: 15> explicitly acknowledged the lack of studies surrounding joint'motion, yet unabashedly.
<line: 16> pushed to expand the market in the U.S. to literally create a need for its product..

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 107.Zimmer admitted that "in recent years, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has
<line: 19> brought about increasingly better, functional results and greater satisfaction to patients..
<line: 20> Traditionally, 110 degrees to 115 degrees average passive flexion associated with TKA
<line: 21> has been sufficient for Western patients. Western patients whose activities of daily living.
<line: 22> (ADL) involve chairs and beds may be content with a knee range of motion of 115
<line: 23> degrees."

[TEXT]
<line: 25>  108. Nevertheless, Zimmer went on to say in trying to expand its market, Asian
<line: 26> and Middle East patients may need greater flexion to adjust to the cultural demands of.
<line: 27> daily life where "normal range of motion...is considered to be between 130 degrees and.
<line: 28> 155 degrees.".

[TEXT]
<line: 30> 109.  Zimmer then attempted to provide justification for expanding the market
<line: 31> in the U.S. to provide the type of flexion required by Asian and Middle Eastern cultures:.
<line: 32> "There have been only a few studies published regarding the normal range of joint.
<line: 33> motion, and most of these are from the Western Hemisphere. As the reach of our designs.

<line: 9> .
<line: 10> that require considerably more squatting and kneeling activities in everyday life."

[TEXT]
<line: 12> 110.
<line: 13> Without.any self-restraint, Zimmer went on to create its flex market:.

[TEXT]
<line: 15> "the desire or need for flexion in excess: of:115
<line: 16> degrees after TKA is not isolated to Asian.and
<line: 17> Middle East cultures only. There are Western
<line: 18> patients that need the ability to achieve high flexion. .
<line: 19> of the knee because of recreation and/or religious
<line: 20> activities. Gardening is still a popular pastime and
<line: 21> may require sitting on a low stool or.kneeling.
<line: 22> People of Roman Catholic faith often pray while
<line: 23> kneeling, and the process of getting in and'out'of'a
<line: 24> kneeling position can be aided by high flexion
<line: 25> capability."

[TEXT]
<line: 27> 111. Zimmer's approach to the aggressive - yet-inadequately supported for.
<line: 28> safety or efficacy -- campaign for the MIS Tibial device and procedure was no different.

[TEXT]
<line: 30> 112.  A principle component of Zimmer's marketing of the.Zimmer Devices.
<line: 31> was the allure of the MIS surgical procedure, so much"so that Zimmer went to the
<line: 32> extensive effort to trademark the term "MIS" or "Minimally Invasive Solutions."

[TEXT]
<line: 34> 113. Zimmer's MIs Tibial components were marketed as "specifically
<line: 35> designed to address the challenges and demands of minimally invasive TKA." To
<line: 36> achieve these goals, the design incorporated broad proximal fins that engage the tibia,
<line: 37> while its low profile makes it easier to insert.

[TEXT]
<line: 39> 114. Zimmer's promotional materials were specifically designed to induce.
<line: 40> physicians and patients that the use of the MIS Tibial components involved MIS
<line: 41> procedures are less invasive with smaller incisions, reduced blood loss, less pain and.
<line: 42> shorter hospital stays.".

[TEXT]
<line: 8> 115. By 2010, Zimmer was forced to admit that its marketing was false and that
<line: 9> MIS procedures would not result in reduced risk. In April 2010, Zimmer sent an "Urgent
<line: 10> Field Safety Notice'/Urgent Device Correction"' letter to all customers using the
<line: 11> Zimmer NexGen MIS Tibial. . With the urgent notice, gone were the claims of *less
<line: 12> invasive" and "shorter hospital stays." Now Zimmer admits that "MIS procedures are
<line: 13> inherently challenging and can involve reduced visibility, which may lead to difficulty.
<line: 14> with achieving proper implant alignment and cement fixation. On September 13, 2010,
<line: 15> the FDA classified Zimmer's efforts relating to the NexGen MIS Tibial components as a
<line: 16> Class II Recall. About 68,384 MIS Tibial components contained defective surgical
<line: 17> instructions and warnings.

[TEXT]
<line: 19> 116.Despite Zimmer's marketing statements, its NexGen Knees identified

[TITLE]
<line: 23> LACK OF EFFICACY AND FAILURE OF ZIMMER NEXGEN KNEES

[TEXT]
<line: 25> 117. There are several reasons for the failure of knee implants.  The primary
<line: 26> reason for failure implicated in this litigation is "mechanical: loosening." Mechanical
<line: 27> "loosening" means that the attachment between the artificial knee and the existing bone
<line: 28> has become loose.

[TEXT]
<line: 30>  118.  Loosening can occur with any component of the artificial knee, including
<line: 31> the femoral, tibial or patellar component.

[TEXT]
<line: 33> 119. Loosening of an artificial knee can be visualized and diagnosed using
<line: 34> radiographic imaging. Images of a loose knee joint are one:or. more radiolucent lines
<line: 35> around the contours of the artificial knee joint.

<line: 8>  120. . A loose artificial knee causes pain and wearing away of the bone. A loose
<line: 9> artificial knee can involve a severe physical burden for the patient and severely restrict
<line: 10> the patient's daily activities.

[TEXT]
<line: 12> 121. Once the individual loses function of the knee' or the pain becomes
<line: 13> unbearable, another operation can be required to revise the knee replacement. A loose,.
<line: 14> painful artificial knee can usually, but not always, be replaced.

[TEXT]
<line: 16>  122. The purpose of knee revision surgery is to remoye a failed knee implant
<line: 17> and replace it with a new one..

[TEXT]
<line: 19> 123. In an operation revising a total knee failure due to loosening, the most
<line: 20> significant problem is often the reconstruction of the severe: bone loss caused by the.
<line: 21> failed total knee prosthesis. The bone loss makes it difficult to restore the stability in the
<line: 22> revised total knee.

[TEXT]
<line: 24> 124. The success rate of a revision operation is lower than that of the initial
<line: 25> total knee replacement and the risks and complications are higher. The range of motion.
<line: 26>  in the knee after revision surgery may decrease and the ability to walk may also be
<line: 27>  diminished. The rate of an artificial knee replacement loosening is higher after revision

[TEXT]
<line: 8> 126. Throughout the past several years, there has been an increasing drum beat
<line: 9> of evidence establishing that the so-called "High-Flex" knees:'a) fail to provide additional
<line: 10>  or meaningful flexion beyond 120; and b) fail at an artificially/high rate when compared
<line: 11> to their non-flex equivalents.

[TEXT]
<line: 13> 127. Starting in 2005, a study published in the Journal of Bone and Joint
<line: 14> Surgery by Young-Hoo Kim entitled, Range of Motion of Standard and High-Flexion
<line: 15> Posterior Stabilized Total Knee Prostheses, established no statistical significance between
<line: 16> the degree of flexion in a group with a traditional LPS prosthesis versus a group with the
<line: 17> LPS-Flex. Specifically, the authors reported that after two years, the mean range of
<line: 18>  motion/flexion in the LPS group versus the LPS-Flex group was a mere three degrees.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> 128. The Kim study was followed by a report in 2007 in The Journal of Bone
<line: 21> and Joint Surgery (British Edition), published a peer reviewed study by professors at the
<line: 22> Seoul National University College of Medicine entitled, High Incidence of Loosening of
<line: 23> the.. Femoral . Component . in.. the... Legacy . Posterior.. Stabilized-Flex .. Total.. Knee
<line: 24> Replacement. The study showed that 38% of the implanted LPS high flex knees were.
<line: 25> loose shortly after 2 years post implant. From the group of patients with loose knees,
<line: 26> over half (56%) had their knee revised due to pain

[TEXT]
<line: 28> 129.  In 2010 a new study by SD Cho published in the Knee Surgery, Sports
<line: 29> Traumatology, Arthroscopy questioned the efficacy of high flex knees, specifically the
<line: 30> LPS-flex. In the article, entitled, Three to six year follow-up'results after high-flexion
<line: 31> total knee arthroplasty: Can we allow passive deep knee bending?, the authors concluded.
<line: 32> that the LPs-flex knees were associated with a relatively: high incidence of early

<line: 13> patients with the high-flex knees do not have better range of motion (ROM) than patients
<line: 14> with the standard knees.

[TEXT]
<line: 16> 131. In fact, a recent study published in 2010 provided.a meta-analysis of these

<line: 18> from 11 studies comparing a total of 561 high-flex knees with 563 standard knee
<line: 19> implants. Seven of the trials looked at Posterior Stabilized designs and four trials
<line: 20> compared the Cruciate Retaining design implants. The analysis revealed that patients in
<line: 21> each group, the high-flex and the standard, achieved an average post-operative ROM of
<line: 22> 110 degrees. The analysis also revealed no statistical differences in knee ROM, weight-.
<line: 23> bearing flexion, knee scores and complications among the two groups..:

<line: 11> 149. In March 2010, Dr. Steven Weeden, of the Texas Hip and Knee Center,
<line: 12>  presented at a national meeting of the American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons a
<line: 13> study reporting a higher than expected rate of early loosening in cemented primary total
<line: 14> knee replacements when a MIS Tibial component was used without.an additional
<line: 15>  modular stem. In the MIS tibias components placed without an additional modular stem
<line: 16> the failure rate was 24% versus 4.2% with a stem.

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 150.  Notwithstanding the claims made by Zimmer regarding the MIS Tibial
<line: 19> component, in or around April 2010, Defendants sent an "Urgent Field Safety
<line: 20> Notice"/*Urgent Device Correction" letter to all customers using the MIS Tibial.

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 151.  In that letter, Defendants acknowledged, in a stunning reversal of prior
<line: 23> promotion and marketing of the MIS Tibial Component, that the prior procedures were.
<line: 24> wrong and potentially dangerous.

[TEXT]
<line: 26> 152.  Specifically, whereas before Defendants marketed MIS procedures,.
<line: 27> including the MIS Tibial as "less invasive with smaller incisions, reduced blood loss, less.
<line: 28> pain and shorter hospital stays," Defendants admitted that "MIs. procedures are
<line: 29> inherently challenging and can involve reduced visibility, which may lead to difficulty.
<line: 30> with achieving proper implant alignment and cement fixation."

[TEXT]
<line: 32> 153.Defendants went on to alert physicians that "Required Actions" included
<line: 33> "destroy or disregard all previous versions of the surgical technique [MIS]."

<line: 14> b.

<line: 27> of the implanted device requiring revision surgery. There had been 114 MDRs (Medical
<line: 28> Device Reports/complaints) filed; all reported that the device loosened and the patient
<line: 29> required additional surgery to replace the device.
