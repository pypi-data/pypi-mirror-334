[TITLE]
<line: 29> MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

[TEXT]
<line: 31> Plaintiff has sued defendant for breaching a non-competition agreement and using its
<line: 32> confidential information in violation of the Illinois Trade Secrets Act (“ITSA”), 765 Ill. Comp. Stat.
<line: 33> 1065/1 et seq.  Plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction on its claims, which the Court referred
<line: 34> to Magistrate Judge Cox for a Report and Recommendation (“R&R”).  Both parties filed objections
<line: 35> to the R&R, all of which the Court overrules.  

[TITLE]
<line: 37> Background

[TEXT]
<line: 39> Plaintiff, which sells printing equipment and services, has three business divisions:  (1)
<line: 40> Document Printing Systems (“DPS”), which markets standard printers and scanners; (2) Production
<line: 41> Printing Systems (“PPS”), which markets high-volume printers; and (3) Wide Format Printing
<line: 42> Systems (“WFPS”), which markets printers and scanners for over-sized documents.  (First Am.
<line: 43> Compl. ¶¶ 5-6.)  Defendant was plaintiff’s PPS Central Regional Sales Director from 1996 through
<line: 44> 2001.  (Id. ¶ 8; Def.’s App. Exs. Supp. Mem. Law Opp’n Mot. Prelim. Inj., Brazeau Aff. [“Brazeau
<line: 45> Aff.”] ¶ 2; Mot. Prelim. Inj., Sundberg Decl. [“Sundberg Decl.”] ¶ 7.)  In 2001, he became Central

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Regional Sales Manager for IBM Printing Systems, one of plaintiff’s competitors in the PPS market.
<line: 3> (First Am. Compl. ¶ 8; Brazeau Aff. ¶ 3.)

[TEXT]
<line: 5> In 2005, defendant returned to work for plaintiff as Vice President of Sales for the WFPS
<line: 6> unit.  (First Am. Compl. ¶ 9; Brazeau Aff. ¶ 5; Sundberg Decl. ¶ 8.)  In that role, he had access to
<line: 7> confidential information about plaintiff’s sales strategies and business development plans through
<line: 8> its Oasis database and cross-division selling program.  (Brazeau Aff. ¶¶ 13-27; Sundberg Dec. ¶ 12.) 

[TEXT]
<line: 10> On August 10, 2005, the parties entered into an agreement that requires defendant to
<line: 11> maintain the confidentiality of plaintiff’s information and not to compete with plaintiff for a year
<line: 12> after his employment ends.  (See First Am. Compl, Ex. A, 2005 Agreement ¶¶ 5, 10 .)  In January
<line: 13> 2007, the parties entered into a second agreement that does not specifically prohibit defendant from
<line: 14> disclosing plaintiff’s confidential information but contains a broad non-compete clause purportedly
<line: 15> designed to protect plaintiff’s confidential information, customer relationships and goodwill.  (Id.,
<line: 16> Ex. B, 2007 Agreement ¶ 2.) 

[TEXT]
<line: 18> In February 2009, defendant left Océ to work for InfoPrint, a joint venture of IBM Printing
<line: 19> Systems and Ricoh.   (Answer First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 47-48; Brazeau Aff. ¶ 32.)  Defendant’s primary
<line: 20> responsibility at InfoPrint, which sells PPS equipment and services, is to manage its sales strategy. 
<line: 21> (Id.)  Plaintiff contends that defendant cannot work in this capacity for InfoPrint without violating
<line: 22> the non-competition agreement or disclosing plaintiff’s confidential information. 

[TITLE]
<line: 24> Discussion

[TEXT]
<line: 26> The Court reviews de novo the portions of the R&R to which the parties object.  28 U.S.C.
<line: 27> § 636(b)(1)(A).  The first objection, lodged by plaintiff, is to Judge Cox’s ruling that the 2007

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> 2

[TEXT]
<line: 2> agreement controls the parties’ dispute.  (See R&R at 13-14.)  Judge Cox said the ruling was
<line: 3> compelled by the record, which showed that plaintiff told defendant the 2007 agreement controlled,
<line: 4> and the doctrine of unilateral mistake.  (Id. at 14 (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 153
<line: 5> (stating that a contract is voidable if one party causes the other to make a mistake about a basic
<line: 6> assumption underlying it)).)

[TEXT]
<line: 8> The Court agrees with that conclusion, for a different reason:  merger.  Under Illinois law,
<line: 9> “[a] complete, valid, written contract merges and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous
<line: 10> negotiations and agreements dealing with the same subject matter.”  Courtois v. Millard, 529 N.E.2d
<line: 11> 77, 79 (Ill. App. Ct. 1988); see Ogle v. Hotto, 652 N.E.2d 815, 819 (Ill. App. Ct. 1995) (same).  The
<line: 12> 2005 and 2007 agreements both address defendant’s post-employment obligations, but they do so
<line: 13> differently.  The 2005 agreement bars defendant from disclosing plaintiff’s confidential information
<line: 14> and from selling competitors’ products in a specified area for a year after his employment with
<line: 15> plaintiff ends.  (First Am. Compl., Ex. A, 2005 Agreement ¶¶ 5, 10.)  The 2007 agreement does not
<line: 16> expressly require defendant to maintain the confidentiality of plaintiff’s information but has an
<line: 17> expansive non-competition clause, “to protect the confidentiality of [plaintiff’s] Confidential
<line: 18> Information, . . . valuable customer relationships and goodwill.” (Id., Ex. B, 2007 Agreement ¶ 2.) 
<line: 19> Because the two agreements address the same subject matter, the 2007 agreement supersedes the
<line: 20> 2005 agreement as a matter of law.  Courtois, 529 N.E.2d at 79.

[TEXT]
<line: 22> Judge Cox also ruled that paragraph 2(b), rather than 2(a), of the 2007 agreement applies,
<line: 23> a conclusion to which defendant objects.  In relevant part, that paragraph states:

[TEXT]
<line: 25> . . . Employee covenants and promises that during his or her employment with the
<line: 26> Company and for one (1) year after Employee’s employment by the Company ends
<line: 27> . . . , that: 

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> 3

[TEXT]
<line: 2> (a) if Employee was employed in a sales capacity by Company, Employee shall not
<line: 3> directly or indirectly become associated with, through ownership, employment, self-
<line: 4> employment, consultancy, contract or otherwise, any “Competing Business” (which
<line: 5> term shall mean any person, corporation, or other entity which designs, develops,
<line: 6> manufactures, markets, sells or services any product or service which is the same as
<line: 7> or similar to products or services which the Company designed, developed,
<line: 8> manufactured, marketed, sold or serviced within the last twelve (12) months prior to
<line: 9> the end of Employee’s employment with the Company, including but not limited to,
<line: 10> printing, copying, multifunctional and/or facsimile equipment and/or sales of related
<line: 11> supplies) and approach, solicit or accept business from any of the Company’s then-
<line: 12> existing customers or identified prospective customers (i) within Employee’s
<line: 13> assigned area of responsibility, or (ii) within the area of responsibility of sales
<line: 14> representatives for whom Employee had management responsibility or (iii) that
<line: 15> Employee approached, solicited, or accepted business from on behalf of the
<line: 16> Company.  Furthermore, Employee shall not aid or assist any other person to do any
<line: 17> of the above.  The territory set forth in i, ii, and iii shall be determined by the then
<line: 18> existing  customers and identified prospective customers of the Company within the
<line: 19> one year period preceding Employee’s separation from the Company; and/or

[TEXT]
<line: 21> (b) if Employee was employed by Company in a capacity other than sales or service,
<line: 22> such as, but not limited to, an employee subject to the Company’s incentive and/or
<line: 23> bonus plan, Employee shall not directly or indirectly become associated with,
<line: 24> through ownership, employment, self-employment, consultancy, contract or
<line: 25> otherwise, any Competing Business.  Employee recognizes that the geographic
<line: 26> locations within which the Company does business, trades and/or markets its
<line: 27> products and services is nationwide, that Employee’s work for the Company is
<line: 28> national in scope and agrees that it is reasonably necessary for the legitimate
<line: 29> protection of the Company’s customer relationships and goodwill and Company
<line: 30> Confidential Information that the scope of this restriction be nationwide; . . . .

[TEXT]
<line: 32> (First Am. Compl., Ex. B, 2007 Agreement ¶ 2.)  The plain language of subparagraph b defines
<line: 33> employees “employed in a capacity other than sales or service” as, among others, those who are
<line: 34> “subject to the Company’s incentive and/or bonus plan.”  There is no dispute that plaintiff was
<line: 35> subject to the incentive plan when he signed the 2007 agreement.  (See 7/8/09 Hr’g Tr. at 20, 114.) 
<line: 36> Thus, the Court agrees with Judge Cox that paragraph 2(b) applies. 

[TEXT]
<line: 38> To obtain a preliminary injunction, plaintiff must show that it has a likelihood of success on
<line: 39> the merits of its claims, it has no adequate remedy at law and will suffer irreparable harm if an

[ABANDON]
<line: 41> 4

[TEXT]
<line: 2> injunction is not issued, and its injury outweighs any injury an injunction may inflict on defendant. 
<line: 3> Foodcom Int’l v. Barry, 328 F.3d 300, 303 (7th Cir. 2003).  To succeed on either its contract or trade
<line: 4> secrets claim, plaintiff must prove that it has protectable confidential information and defendant has
<line: 5> used or will use it for InfoPrint’s benefit.  See Outsource Int’l, Inc. v. Barton, 192 F.3d 662, 666 (7th
<line: 6> Cir. 1999) (stating that a restrictive covenant is enforceable to protect the confidentiality of trade
<line: 7> secrets an employee acquires from one employer and tries to use for another); Pepsico, Inc., v.
<line: 8> Redmond, 54 F.3d 1262, 1267-68 & n.5 (7th Cir. 1995) (noting that an ITSA claim requires proof
<line: 9> that plaintiff has a trade secret, i.e., “important confidential business information,” and defendant
<line: 10> misappropriated it (quotation omitted)).  Judge Cox found that plaintiff had confidential information
<line: 11> in its Oasis and cross-selling databases and that defendant had access to both.  (R&R at 17-20.)   But
<line: 12> she also said there was little evidence to suggest that defendant had used or would use any of
<line: 13> plaintiff’s information on behalf of InfoPrint.  

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Plaintiff believes the latter finding is contradicted by, among other things, two of defendant’s
<line: 16> InfoPrint emails.  The first is defendant’s response to a report that InfoPrint could lose its U.S. Bank
<line: 17> account to “either Oce or Xerox.”  (See Def.’s Supplemental App. Exs. In Camera Review Supp.
<line: 18> Supplemental Br. Opp’n Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 3, Email from McGinnis to Brazeau of 3/6/09.)  It
<line: 19> says:  “Please pay particular attention to this customer specifically Greg Remter.  I know for a fact
<line: 20> that Oce is very active in this account and are just waiting for an opportunity to get some traction
<line: 21> with Greg.”  (Cooperman Aff., Ex. 60, Email from Brazeau to Weir of 3/18/09.)  In plaintiff’s view,
<line: 22> this email reference to Océ shows that defendant used its confidential information for InfoPrint.

[TEXT]
<line: 24> The Court disagrees for several reasons.  First, the email chain about U.S. Bank shows that
<line: 25> defendant was responding to, not making, the assertion that Océ was a threat to that account.  (Id.) 

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 5

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Second, the record shows that U.S. Bank was an InfoPrint customer before defendant started work
<line: 3> there and contains no evidence that plaintiff had or sought a relationship with U.S. Bank when
<line: 4> defendant was in its employ.  (Cooperman Supplemental Decl., Ex. A, InfoPrint Financial
<line: 5> Documents at IPS16851; id., Ex. D, PPS Top 40 Active Sales Cycles; Cooperman Aff., Ex. 38 PPS
<line: 6> Top 40 Active Sales Cycles.)  Third, defendant testified that he did not obtain any information about
<line: 7> U.S. Bank from plaintiff or give any information about it to InfoPrint, testimony that is corroborated
<line: 8> by the InfoPrint sales representative for the U.S. Bank account.  (Def.’s Supplemental App. Exs.
<line: 9> Supp. Supplemental Br. Opp’n Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. N, Brazeau Supplemental Aff. [“Brazeau
<line: 10> Supplemental Aff.”] ¶¶ 23-29; id., Ex. R, McGinnis Aff. ¶¶ 3-8.)  Accordingly, viewed in context,
<line: 11> defendant’s email does not suggest that plaintiff had or defendant misappropriated confidential
<line: 12> information about U.S. Bank.

[TEXT]
<line: 14> The second email is defendant’s response to this message from InfoPrint’s CEO:

[TEXT]
<line: 16> I noticed that your team is trying to sell an IP5000 to Wachovia, and while I would
<line: 17> like to see that happen, I think we are making a mistake and competition will force
<line: 18> us to back-peddle.  Instead, I think we should go into Wachovia demonstrating our
<line: 19> understanding of their financial constraints and as a result, demonstrate our own
<line: 20> readiness to make a financial sacrifice by proposing an IP5000 on SIP and thus help
<line: 21> through difficult financial period.  This is what “setting the agenda” is about. 
<line: 22> Otherwise, Kodak and others will offer a trial and we will be forced to back-peddle
<line: 23> with a “me too” offer.    This has the potential of an instant SYMCOR reply.  Please
<line: 24> get involved and make your team offer a SIP IP5000.

[TEXT]
<line: 26> (Cooperman Aff., Ex. 61, Email to Brazeau from Romero of 3/25/09.)   It says:  “Let me run with
<line: 27> this.  Wachovia is an Oce account and I know that their color volume is limited and will need time
<line: 28> to grow so a SIP would make sense from that view  point.”  (Id., Email to Romero from Brazeau of
<line: 29> 3/25/09.)  Again, plaintiff contends that defendant’s references to Wachovia and Océ indicate
<line: 30> misappropriation.

[ABANDON]
<line: 32> 6

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Again, the Court disagrees.  To start, the record does not establish that Wachovia was an Océ
<line: 3> PPS customer when defendant worked there.  To prove this point, plaintiff submitted two 
<line: 4> documents entitled “Top 40 PPS Sales Cycles,” which, though they are visibly different, plaintiff
<line: 5> says are both copies of a single document it found on plaintiff’s computer.  (See Cooperman Aff.
<line: 6> ¶¶ 2-3 (stating that Exhibit 38 is the PPS sales cycle document “found on Andre Brazeau’s external
<line: 7> hard drive”); id., Ex. 38, PPS Top 40 Active Sales Cycles, OCE0009687-706; Supplemental Mem.
<line: 8> Law Supp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 5; Cooperman Supplemental Decl. ¶ 5 (stating that Exhibit D,
<line: 9> OCE0026241-67, is a copy of the “PPS sales cycle document . . . located on the external hard drive
<line: 10> for the laptop Brazeau used while at Océ”); id., Ex. D, PPS Top 40 Active Sales Cycles,
<line: 11> OCE0026241-67).  One of the documents lists Wachovia as an Océ customer, the other does not. 
<line: 12> (Compare Cooperman Supplemental Decl., Ex. D at OCE0009687, with Cooperman Aff., Ex. 38.) 
<line: 13> Moreover, even if Wachovia were an Océ customer at the relevant time, there is no evidence that
<line: 14> Brazeau accessed or was exposed to any information about it from plaintiff’s Oasis database, its
<line: 15> cross-selling program or otherwise.  (See Cooperman Aff., Ex. 24, Cross Selling Program DPS
<line: 16> Guest Rep Tracking Report; id., Ex. 25, Cross Selling Program WFPS Guest Rep Tracking Report;
<line: 17> id., Ex. 30, Cross-Selling Program Spreadsheet & Cross Selling Program WFPS Guest Rep Tracking
<line: 18> Report; id., Ex. 34, Cross Divisional Introductions August 2008 Activity Summary; id., Ex. 36,
<line: 19> Cross Selling Program Spreadsheet; id., Ex. 41, June 16, 2008 Staff Meeting Agenda; id., Ex. 42,
<line: 20> February 21, 2008 Staff Meeting Agenda.)  Further, there is unrefuted evidence that Wachovia was
<line: 21> an InfoPrint customer before defendant worked there, and corroborated testimony from defendant
<line: 22> that he did not obtain from plaintiff or give to InfoPrint any information about Wachovia.  (Def.’s
<line: 23> Supplemental Exs. In Camera Review Supp. Supplemental Br. Opp’n Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 6, Email

<line: 3> Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. S, McMahon Aff. ¶¶ 2-5; Brazeau Supplemental Aff. ¶¶ 37-41.)  Thus,
<line: 4> defendant’s Wachovia email does not suggest that he misappropriated information from plaintiff. 

[TEXT]
<line: 6> As plaintiff points out, there is evidence that, soon after he joined InfoPrint, defendant
<line: 7> communicated with or about TSYS, AFLAC, Symcor/Suntrust, Vanguard, Bank of America,
<line: 8> Broadridge, Farmers Insurance and State Farm, all of which were plaintiff’s PPS customers.  (See
<line: 9> Cooperman Aff., Ex. 72, InfoPrint’s Communications with Océ Customers; id., Ex. 38 PPS Top 40
<line: 10> Active Sales Cycles at OCE0009687, 707, 725, 731, 749, 767, 776; id., Ex. 36, OCE206447; id., Ex.

<line: 13> & 3/10/09; Brazeau Supplemental Aff. ¶¶ 22, 42-46, 56-60.)  But the record also shows that:  (1)
<line: 14> Broadridge, Bank of America, Symcor/Suntrust, TSYS, State Farm and Farmers were also InfoPrint
<line: 15> customers and had been before defendant worked there; (2) defendant had established his own
<line: 16> connections with Broadridge, Symcor/Suntrust, TSYS, State Farm and Vanguard years earlier when
<line: 17> he worked for IBM; (3) InfoPrint had been actively soliciting Vanguard’s business for years before
<line: 18> defendant worked there; (4) State Farm had issued a request for proposal to InfoPrint before
<line: 19> defendant started work there; (5) InfoPrint told defendant about Océ’s contacts with Vanguard, Bank
<line: 20> of America, Broadridge, Farmers and State Farm, not the reverse; and (6) defendant’s only contact
<line: 21> with AFLAC, which is primarily a Xerox customer, was making a “courtesy call” on the company
<line: 22> with an InfoPrint sales representative.  (See Cooperman Aff., Ex. 59, Email from Kimicata to

<line: 8> Cosgrove Aff. ¶¶ 2-5; Brazeau Supplemental Aff. ¶ 46.)  This evidence, and defendant’s testimony
<line: 9> that he learned nothing about these companies from plaintiff and said nothing about them to
<line: 10> InfoPrint (Brazeau Supplemental Aff. ¶¶ 19, 31, 37, 43, 48, 53, 57, 62), vitiates any inference of
<line: 11> misappropriation that might arise from these communications. 

[TEXT]
<line: 13> Plaintiff also argues that defendant’s possession of some of its confidential documents after
<line: 14> he resigned suggests misappropriation.  Defendant admits that he kept three flash drives containing
<line: 15> ten Océ documents after he left the company.  (Brazeau Aff. ¶¶ 39-43; see Cooperman Aff., Exs.
<line: 16> 46-55.)  But he claims that he did so inadvertently, a claim the substance of the documents supports. 
<line: 17> Eight of the documents are Powerpoint presentations about goals plaintiff set for 2007 and 2008,
<line: 18> seven of which relate solely to WFPS and none of which identifies current or potential customers,
<line: 19> pricing strategies or profit margins for any of its products or services.  (See Cooperman Aff., Exs.
<line: 20> 47-54.)  Likewise, the ninth document, which is entitled “Divisional Introductions,” is dated October
<line: 21> 9, 2007 and sets forth initial milestones for the cross-selling program, contains no customer-related,
<line: 22> pricing or margin information.   (Id., Ex. 55.)  The last document, entitled “Cross Divisional Selling
<line: 23> Accounts,” identifies seventeen PPS customers, twenty-five DPS customers and nine WFPS
<line: 24> customers who were part of the cross-selling program and the InfoPrint representatives who had

[ABANDON]
<line: 26> 9

[TEXT]
<line: 2> responsibility for them.  (Id., Ex. 46.)  The document is undated but, because it identifies General
<line: 3> Dynamics and Textron as participants, DPS customers that were dropped from the program by July
<line: 4> 28, 2008, it had to have been created before that date.  (See id.; id., Ex. 25, Cross Selling Program
<line: 5> – WFPS Guest Rep Tracking Report at OCE0048280.)  Given their age and content, it is not clear
<line: 6> whether or how these documents would have helped InfoPrint in and after 2009.  Consequently, they
<line: 7> provide little, if any, basis for inferring that defendant misappropriated them.  

[TEXT]
<line: 9> Plaintiff says any evidentiary gap can be filled by an adverse inference from defendant’s
<line: 10> admitted failure to save all of his InfoPrint instant messages.  Like Judge Cox, the Court disagrees. 
<line: 11> An adverse inference may be appropriate if defendant had a duty to preserve the instant messages,
<line: 12> he breached that duty, the breach involved willfulness, bad faith or fault and plaintiff was harmed
<line: 13> by defendant’s actions.  Wells v. Berger, Newmark & Fenchel, P.C., No. 07 C 3061, 2008 WL
<line: 14> 4365972, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 18, 2008).  “A party has a duty to preserve evidence over which it had
<line: 15> control and reasonably knew or could reasonably foresee was material to a potential legal action.” 
<line: 16> Id. at *6.  Defendant’s failure to preserve the messages was willful or in bad faith if it was
<line: 17> “intentional or in reckless disregard of [his] obligations.”   Marrocco v. Gen. Motors Corp., 966 F.2d
<line: 18> 220, 224 (7th Cir. 1992) (emphasis omitted).  Defendant was at “fault,” if his actions were
<line: 19> “objectively unreasonable.”  Long v. Steepro, 213 F.3d 983, 987 (7th Cir. 2000).  A “minor blunder
<line: 20> . . . . mere mistake or slight error in judgment” does not constitute fault.  Id. 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> There is no dispute that defendant used Same Time, InfoPrint’s instant message system, in
<line: 23> the course of his work and did not save those messages until well after this suit was filed.  (Brazeau
<line: 24> Supplemental Aff. ¶¶ 1-5.)  Thus, the evidence shows that defendant had, and breached, a duty to
<line: 25> preserve those messages.

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 10

[TEXT]
<line: 2> The record does not, however, show that defendant acted with “willfulness, bad faith or
<line: 3> fault.” Marrocco, 966 F.2d at 224 (emphasis omitted).  Defendant claims that he did not save his
<line: 4> instant messages from the start of his employment with InfoPrint because he did not know that he
<line: 5> had the option or ability to do so.  (Brazeau Supplemental Aff. ¶¶ 3-5.)  Until he learned otherwise
<line: 6> during this suit, defendant says he assumed InfoPrint treated Same Time messages like emails,
<line: 7> which are stored on its server.  (Id.)  Moreover, once he discovered that he could, and would have
<line: 8> to, change the program’s default settings to save his Same Time messages, defendant says he
<line: 9> promptly did so.  (Id.)  Plaintiff has no evidence that indicates otherwise, i.e., that defendant knew,
<line: 10> or should have known, that Same Time messages were not automatically saved.  It has not, therefore,
<line: 11> proven that defendant’s actions were intentional, reckless or unreasonable.  Long, 213 F.3d at 987.

[TEXT]
<line: 13> Even if there were evidence of defendant’s culpability, an adverse inference would still be
<line: 14> inappropriate because the record suggests the spoliation caused plaintiff little harm.  The record
<line: 15> shows that defendant produced 55,000 documents and the parties deposed nine witnesses, which
<line: 16> yielded scant evidence of misappropriation  (R&R at 22; 7/8/09 Hr’g Tr. at 134; Cooperman Aff.,
<line: 17> Exs. 1-9, Deps. of Sundberg, Harper, Chapius, Wagner, Roberts, Roche, Baboyian, Romero &
<line: 18> Brazeau.)  Given the circumstances, it would be unreasonable, as Judge Cox put it, to infer that the
<line: 19> missing messages “contained the ‘smoking gun’ . . . evidence” of misappropriation.  (R&R at 22.) 

[TEXT]
<line: 21> Alternatively, plaintiff argues that it proved misappropriation through the doctrine of
<line: 22> inevitable disclosure discussed in Pepsico.  The plaintiff in that case sued a former employee for
<line: 23> trade secrets misappropriation.  54 F.3d at 1264-65.  The district court, believing that defendant
<line: 24> would inevitably use plaintiff’s trade secrets in his new job, enjoined him from performing the job
<line: 25> for six months.  Id. at 1267.  Defendant appealed, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed the injunction

[TEXT]
<line: 2> and endorsed the lower court’s use of the inevitable disclosure doctrine.  Id. at 1269 (“[A] plaintiff
<line: 3> may prove a claim of trade secret misappropriation by demonstrating that defendant’s new
<line: 4> employment will inevitably lead him to rely on the plaintiff’s trade secrets.”).

[TEXT]
<line: 6> Defendant argues that inevitable disclosure applies only to trade secrets claims, the claim at
<line: 7> issue in Pepsico, while plaintiff argues that its logic extends to non-compete claims as well.  The
<line: 8> Court agrees with plaintiff that any value the doctrine may have for proving disclosure should be
<line: 9> the same regardless of the claim for which disclosure must be proven.  (See id. at 1268 & Outsource,
<line: 10> 192 F.3d at 666 (stating that proof of disclosure is a required element of both ITSA and non-compete
<line: 11> claims).)  Whether the Illinois Supreme Court would agree is another question, but one the Court
<line: 12> need not decide because the record in this case does not support a finding of inevitable disclosure. 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> The Pepsico court endorsed inevitable disclosure as it was defined in Teradyne, Inc. v. Clear
<line: 15> Communications Corp., 707 F. Supp. 353 (N.D. Ill. 1989) and Amp Inc. v. Fleischhacker, 823 F.2d
<line: 16> 1199 (7th Cir. 1987).  Id. at 1268-69.  The Teradyne court dismissed a trade secrets claim because
<line: 17> defendants’ alleged acts, “working for Teradyne, knowing its business, leaving its business, hiring
<line: 18> employees from Teradyne and entering the same field (though in a market not yet serviced by
<line: 19> Teradyne)” did not support an inference of inevitable disclosure.  707 F. Supp. at 357; see Pepsico,
<line: 20> 54 F.3d at 1268 (stating that the complaint in Teradyne “would have passed muster” if it had alleged
<line: 21> that defendants said they “intended to use Teradyne’s trade secrets or . . . disavowed their
<line: 22> confidentiality agreements with Teradyne, or . . . that Clear could not operate without Teradyne’s
<line: 23> secrets”).  The Amp court affirmed the denial of a trade secrets preliminary injunction because “the
<line: 24> mere fact that a person assumed a similar position at a competitor does not, without more, make it
<line: 25> ‘inevitable that he will use or disclose . . . trade secret information.’”  Pepsico, 54 F.3d at 1269

[TEXT]
<line: 2> (quoting Amp, 823 F.2d at 1207).  In short, Teradyne, Amp and Pepsico teach that inevitable
<line: 3> disclosure is a viable, but exacting, method of proving misappropriation. 

[TEXT]
<line: 5> The evidence in this case falls short.  The record shows that defendant worked as plaintiff’s
<line: 6> PPS Central Regional Sales Director from 1996 to 2001 and, in that position, had access to its
<line: 7> customer contact, pricing and business strategy information for its PPS products. (Mot. Prelim. Inj.,
<line: 8> Sundberg Decl. ¶ 7; Brazeau Aff. ¶ 2.)  In 2001, defendant left his job with plaintiff to work in a
<line: 9> virtually identical position for IBM Printing Systems, InfoPrint’s predecessor and a PPS competitor
<line: 10> of plaintiff.  (Brazeau Aff. ¶ 3; Mot. Prelim. Inj., Sundberg Decl. ¶ 7.)  Defendant stayed at IBM
<line: 11> through 2004 and testifies, without evidentiary contradiction, that he performed his duties there
<line: 12> without disclosing any confidential information he had obtained during his prior employment with
<line: 13> plaintiff.  (Brazeau Aff. ¶¶ 3-4.)

[TEXT]
<line: 15> In 2005, defendant left IBM to return to work for plaintiff as Vice President of Sales for its
<line: 16> WFPS division.  (Id. ¶ 5; Mot. Prelim Inj., Sundberg Decl. ¶ 8.)  In this position, defendant had
<line: 17> access to plaintiff’s Oasis database, which houses confidential customer contact, pricing and sales
<line: 18> cycle information, but he rarely consulted it.  (Id. ¶¶ 13-15; Sundberg Aff., Ex. 5, Roberts Dep. at
<line: 19> 20-21.)  He was also part of the committee that implemented the cross-selling program, which gave
<line: 20> him access to confidential information about forty-five, fifteen from each division, of plaintiff’s
<line: 21> 10,000-plus customers.  (Brazeau Aff. ¶¶ 19-20, 24; Mot. Prelim. Inj., Roche Decl. ¶¶ 6-8, 14;
<line: 22> Sundberg Aff, Ex. 6, Roche Dep. at 32, 46, 84.)  But the cross-selling program occupied “at most
<line: 23> 3%” of defendant’s  time and generated only $800,000.00 of plaintiff’s $3.7 billion annual revenues. 
<line: 24> (Brazeau Aff. ¶¶ 21-22; Sundberg Aff., Ex. 6, Roche Dep. at 49-50; see id., Ex. 34, Cross Divisional
<line: 25> Introductions August 2008 Activity Summary at OCE0069739); http://www.oceusa.com (follow

<line: 2> “Corporate Information” hyperlink; then follow “About Océ” hyperlink; then follow “Who We Are”
<line: 3> hyperlink).  Further, defendant says, again without contradiction, that he did not use any of IBM’s
<line: 4> confidential information in his work for plaintiff.  (Id. ¶ 9.)

[TEXT]
<line: 6> In 2009, defendant resigned his WFPS position with plaintiff to become Senior Vice
<line: 7> President and General Manager of the Americas at InfoPrint (Brazeau Aff. ¶¶ 32, 34; Brazeau
<line: 8> Supplemental Aff. ¶ 1), but there is virtually no evidence that he has used or will use plaintiff’s
<line: 9> confidential information for his new employer.

[TEXT]
<line: 11> In short, the record shows that defendant is able to work for competitors without divulging
<line: 12> one company’s confidential information to the other, had access to plaintiff’s confidential
<line: 13> information through a database he rarely used and a cross-selling program that occupied a fraction
<line: 14> of defendant’s time, involved a fraction of  plaintiff’s customers and generated a fraction of its
<line: 15> revenues.  Though there is some evidence that might suggest misappropriation, it is scant,
<line: 16> circumstantial and dwarfed in probative value by evidence to the contrary.  Thus, the inevitable
<line: 17> disclosure doctrine would not help plaintiff, even if it applied to both his ITSA and non-competition
<line: 18> claims. 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Plaintiff also contests Judge Cox’s finding that the non-competition agreement is
<line: 21> unenforceable.  Such agreements are enforceable only if “the restraints [they] impose[] . . . are
<line: 22> reasonably necessary” to protect an employer’s legitimate business interest.  Arpac Corp. v. Murray,
<line: 23> 589 N.E.2d 640, 649 (Ill. App. Ct. 1992).  “[R]easonableness is measured by [an agreement’s]
<line: 24> hardship to the employee, its effect upon the general public, and the reasonableness of the time,
<line: 25> territory, and activity restrictions.”  Id.

[TEXT]
<line: 2> The agreement in this case bars defendant from “directly or indirectly becom[ing] associated
<line: 3> with, through ownership, employment, self-employment, consultancy, contract or otherwise” any: 

[TEXT]
<line: 5> person, corporation, or other entity which designs, develops, manufactures, markets,
<line: 6> sells or services any product or service which is the same as or similar to products
<line: 7> or services which the Company designed, developed, manufactured, marketed, sold
<line: 8> or serviced within the last twelve (12) months prior to the end of Employee’s
<line: 9> employment with the Company, including, but not limited to, printing, copying,
<line: 10> multifunctional and/or facsimile equipment and/or sales of related supplies . . . .

[TEXT]
<line: 12> (First Am. Compl., Ex. B, 2007 Agreement ¶ 2.)  The covenant is one-year in length and nation-wide
<line: 13> in scope.  (Id.)

[TEXT]
<line: 15> As plaintiff points out, some courts have enforced nationwide covenants not to compete of
<line: 16> similar duration.  See, e.g., Gorman Pub. Co. v. Stillman, 516 F. Supp. 98, 101-06 (N.D. Ill. 1980)
<line: 17> (enforcing two-year covenant not to compete nationally); Instrumentalist Co. v. Band, Inc., 480
<line: 18> N.E.2d 1273, 1281 (Ill. App. Ct. 1985) (same); Donald McElroy, Inc. v. Delaney, 389 N.E.2d 1300,
<line: 19> 1304-07 (Ill. App. Ct. 1978) (enforcing three-year nationwide covenant).  In these cases, however,
<line: 20> the breadth of one restriction was tempered by the limitations of another.  The covenant in
<line: 21> Instrumentalist, for example, applied only to magazines that were “directed to or primarily used by
<line: 22> band or orchestra directors, piano or organ teachers or junior or senior high school instrumental
<line: 23> musicians,” and excluded “‘house organ[s]’ or any magazine . . . distributed” for free.  480 N.E.2d
<line: 24> at 1276.  Similarly, the covenant in Donald McElroy only barred defendant from engaging in
<line: 25> “purchasing activities” with any supplier defendant had contacted on plaintiff’s behalf or who had
<line: 26> actually supplied materials to plaintiff in the last year of defendant’s employment.  389 N.E.2d at
<line: 27> 1304.  See Gorman, 516 F. Supp. at 104 (noting that the covenant applied only to a “limited number
<line: 28> of jobs” and had not prevented defendant from obtaining work in his field); see also Office Elecs.,
<line: 29> Inc. v. Grafic Forms, Inc., 372 N.E.2d 125, 127-28 (Ill. App. Ct. 1978) (enforcing a covenant that

[ABANDON]
<line: 31> 15

[TEXT]
<line: 2> applied only if defendant breached the parties’ employment agreement and only to businesses that
<line: 3> “compete[]with [plaintiff] within a 50 mile radius”).   

[TEXT]
<line: 5> There is no tempering restriction in this agreement, which prohibits defendant from working
<line: 6> for, consulting with or acquiring an interest in any firm, nationwide, that designs, makes, sells or
<line: 7> services any product that is “the same as or similar to” products plaintiff designed, made, sold or
<line: 8> serviced in the last year of defendant’s employment.  (First Am. Compl., Ex. B, 2007 Agreement
<line: 9> ¶ 2(b).)  This agreement is akin to the one in Cambridge Engineering, Inc. v. Mercury Partners 90
<line: 10> BI, Inc., 879 N.E.2d 512 (Ill. App. Ct. 2007), which barred the defendant from “directly or
<line: 11> indirectly, engag[ing] in any activity for or on behalf of Employer’s competitors, or engage in any
<line: 12> business that competes with Employer.”  Id. at 524.  The court said the agreement’s “blanket bar on
<line: 13> all activities for competitors” was unenforceable. Id. at 525-26; see Lawrence & Allen, Inc. v.
<line: 14> Cambridge Human Resource Group, Inc., 685 N.E.2d 434, 444 (Ill. App. Ct. 1997) (“Courts are
<line: 15> hesitant to enforce prohibitions against employees servicing not only customers with whom they had
<line: 16> direct contact, but also customers they never solicited or had contact with while employed by
<line: 17> plaintiff.” (citations omitted)).  Because this agreement, like the one in Cambridge Engineering, bars
<line: 18> defendant from  working in any capacity for or with a company that competes with plaintiff in any
<line: 19> segment of the  copy equipment and services market nationwide, it is unenforceable.  

[TEXT]
<line: 21> Moreover, the Court agrees with Judge Cox that it would be improper to “blue pencil” this
<line: 22> agreement.  (R&R at 25-26.)  Under Illinois law, the Court has discretion to “blue pencil” or modify
<line: 23> an overly broad restrictive covenant.  Arpac, 589 N.E.2d at 652.  However, a court should not
<line: 24> modify an agreement that is patently unfair or requires “drastic modifications” because doing so
<line: 25> could “discourag[e] the narrow and precise draftsmanship which should be reflected in written
