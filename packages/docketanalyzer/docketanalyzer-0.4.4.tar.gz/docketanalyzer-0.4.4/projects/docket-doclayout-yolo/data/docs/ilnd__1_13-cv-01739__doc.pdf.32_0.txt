[TITLE]
<line: 22> MEMORANDUM ORDER

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Pro se plaintiff Michael Ruffin-El (“Ruffin-El”) continues
<line: 25> to have difficulty in coming to grips with one of the objections
<line: 26> interposed by his ex-employer Saint-Gobain Containers, Inc.
<line: 27> (“Saint-Gobain”) to his lawsuit charging it with employment
<line: 28> discrimination.  Ruffin-El has just filed what he captions as his
<line: 29> “2nd Amended Complaint,” in which he continues to stress what he
<line: 30> labels as his Moorish American status, so that he begins his
<line: 31> current Statement of Claim in this fashion:

[TEXT]
<line: 33> The Plaintiff affirms he is not from the African
<line: 34> continent, that he and his ancestry are indigenous to
<line: 35> the land of present-day America.

[TEXT]
<line: 37> This Court has great respect for, and has no desire to
<line: 38> challenge, Ruffin-El’s beliefs and self-image.  But what he does
<line: 39> not focus on at all is the limited nature of Saint-Gobain’s
<line: 40> objection in that respect--an objection that is graphically
<line: 41> demonstrated by the contrast between his original Complaint and
<line: 42> the Charge of Discrimination that he lodged with EEOC as a
<line: 43> prelude to filing suit:

[TEXT]
<line: 2> 1.  Complaint ¶9 provides a pro se plaintiff with the
<line: 3> opportunity to check one or more of several boxes to
<line: 4> identify the ground or grounds on which an employer
<line: 5> assertedly discriminated against the plaintiff employee or
<line: 6> ex-employee.  In this instance Ruffin-El checked four such
<line: 7> grounds, including “National Origin” (Complaint ¶9(d)).

[TEXT]
<line: 9> 2.  But when Ruffin-El had lodged his Charge of
<line: 10> Discrimination (“Charge”) with EEOC back in July 2011, that
<line: 11> form also gave him a choice of a number of possible bases
<line: 12> for the alleged discrimination, again including “NATIONAL
<line: 13> ORIGIN” among them. Ruffin-El left that box blank, instead
<line: 14> placing an “X” only in the boxes labeled “RACE” and
<line: 15> “DISABILITY.”  And those choices, including the omission of
<line: 16> any “national origin” charge, were reconfirmed by the
<line: 17> Charge’s narrative “particulars” that followed the form’s
<line: 18> designation of discrimination categories:

[TEXT]
<line: 20> I believe that I was discriminated against because of
<line: 21> my race, Black, in violation of Title VII of the Civil
<line: 22> Rights Act of 1964, as amended.  Also I believe I was
<line: 23> discriminated against because of my disability, in
<line: 24> violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of
<line: 25> 1990, as amended.

[TEXT]
<line: 27> In light of those facts, the portion of Saint-Gobain’s
<line: 28> motion to dismiss that targets Ruffin-El’s presently asserted
<line: 29> claim of “national origin” discrimination must be and is granted,
<line: 30> and the unbidden and unauthorized 2nd Amended Complaint is
<line: 31> stricken. In addition, Ruffin El’s ill-considered motion for

[ABANDON]
<line: 33> 2

[TEXT]
<line: 2> summary judgment is denied without prejudice..

[TEXT]
<line: 4> Because this Court's June 20 memorandum order had granted
<line: 5> Ruffin-El until July 3 to file a response to the "national.
<line: 6> origin" aspect of Saint-Gobain's motion to dismiss, nothing
<line: 7> further will be required in that respect..
<line: 8> Instead the July 3
<line: 9> status hearing, which had been set to coincide with that due date
<line: 10> for filing, will be used to discuss other aspects of the case.
