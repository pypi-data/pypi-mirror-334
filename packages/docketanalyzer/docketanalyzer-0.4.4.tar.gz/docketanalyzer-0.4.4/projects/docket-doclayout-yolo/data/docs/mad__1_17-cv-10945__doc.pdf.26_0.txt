<line: 18> Introduction 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Petitioner Otis Renaldo Harris’s Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to the 
<line: 21> Savings Clause 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (“Petition”) [#1] challenges the use of three state felony drug 
<line: 22> convictions as predicate offenses for a career offender sentencing enhancement under the United 
<line: 23> States Sentencing Guidelines (“U.S.S.G”) § 4B1.1. Pet. 1 [#1]. Respondent Jeffrey Grondolsky 
<line: 24> has moved to dismiss, arguing that: (1)  Petitioner’s claim should have been brought under 28 
<line: 25> U.S.C. § 2255; (2)  Petitioner’s claim is not subject to the Savings Clause in § 2255(e) because 
<line: 26> Petitioner fails to demonstrate that the remedies under § 2255 are “inadequate or ineffective”; 
<line: 27> and (3) even if Petitioner had brought a claim under § 2255, this court does not have subject 
<line: 28> matter jurisdiction to hear such a claim. Mot. Dismiss 1, 9-10 [#13]. For the reasons set forth 
<line: 29> below, the Motion to Dismiss [#13] is ALLOWED.

[TITLE]
<line: 2> II. 
<line: 3> Background 

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Petitioner pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 
<line: 6> five kilograms or more of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846 pursuant to a Plea Agreement 
<line: 7> [#13-1] in the District of Maryland. Pet. 4 [#1]; Mot. Dismiss Attach. 1 (“Plea Agreement”) ¶ 1 
<line: 8> [#13-1]. At sentencing on November 23, 2009, the court determined that Petitioner’s offense 
<line: 9> level as a career offender was 34 and his criminal history category was VI, “which under the 
<line: 10> sentencing guidelines provide[d] a recommended range of sentence of 262-327 months.” Mot. 
<line: 11> Dismiss Attach. 2 (“Sentencing Tr.”) 12:4-8 [#13-2]. Petitioner was sentenced to 280 months 
<line: 12> imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Id. 24:9-11, 17-18 [#13-2]. Petitioner did not 
<line: 13> appeal. See United States v. Harris, No. RWT 8:08-cr-0319-006 (D. Md. Nov. 23, 2009). 

[TEXT]
<line: 15> On June 2, 2014, Petitioner filed a Motion to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Sentence 
<line: 16> Pursuant to Title 28 U.S.C. § 2255 [#13-4] in the United States District Court for the District of 
<line: 17> Maryland, arguing ineffective assistance from counsel, Rule 11 violations, abuse of discretion by 
<line: 18> the court, and that the sentencing enhancements were improper. Mot. Dismiss Attach. 4 (“Pet’r’s 
<line: 19> 2255 Mot.”) 7-8 [#13-4]. On the government’s motion, the court dismissed Petitioner’s § 2255 
<line: 20> motion as untimely, issuing no certificate of appealability. Mot. Dismiss Attach. 6 (“2255 
<line: 21> Order”) [#13-6].  

[TEXT]
<line: 23> On May 19, 2017, Petitioner filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 
<line: 24> U.S.C. § 2241. Pet. [#1]. In response, Respondent filed the pending motion to dismiss. Mot. 
<line: 25> Dismiss 1 [#13].

[TITLE]
<line: 2> III. 
<line: 3> Analysis 

[TITLE]
<line: 5> a. Petitioner’s Challenge to the Validity of His Sentence Falls Under § 2255  

[TEXT]
<line: 7> 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241 and 2255 allow prisoners to challenge their detention from two 
<line: 8> different approaches. 28 U.S.C. § 2255 petitions are the proper means for a petitioner to “claim[] 
<line: 9> the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the 
<line: 10> Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose 
<line: 11> such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is 
<line: 12> otherwise subject to collateral attack.” 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a). 28 U.S.C. § 2241 habeas petitions 
<line: 13> challenge “the execution rather than the validity of the sentence,” United States v. Barrett, 178 
<line: 14> F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir. 1999). 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Petitioner’s claim challenges the validity of his sentence. Petitioner argues that his three 
<line: 17> prior felony convictions should not have been used to add the career offender enhancement to his 
<line: 18> sentence and that Petitioner should have been sentenced to less time in custody. Pet. 4-5 [#1]. 
<line: 19> Since Petitioner is challenging the validity of his sentence, not the execution, this claim falls 
<line: 20> under § 2255. 

[TITLE]
<line: 22> b. This Court Does Not have Jurisdiction to Hear Petitioner’s § 2255 Claim 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> This court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear Petitioner’s § 2255 claim for two 
<line: 25> reasons. First, a § 2255 petition must be filed in the district court “which imposed the sentence.” 
<line: 26> 28 U.S.C. §2255(a). Petitioner was sentenced in the United States District Court for the District 
<line: 27> of Maryland, and so must file his petition there. Second, a prisoner, like petitioner, seeking to file 
<line: 28> a second or successive § 2255 petition must first “move in the appropriate court of appeals for an 
<line: 29> order authorizing the district court to consider the application.” 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(A). The 
<line: 30> appropriate court of appeals to hear Petitioner’s request for leave to file a second or successive 

[ABANDON]
<line: 32> 3 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> petition is the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Petitioner has not received authorization from
<line: 3> that court to bring a second or successive petition.

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Accordingly, this district court in the District of Massachusetts lacks subject matter.
<line: 6> jurisdiction to adjudicate Petitioner's claim under s 2255.

[TEXT]
<line: 8> c.Petitioner Cannot Bring a  2241 Claim by Way of the Savings Clause

[TEXT]
<line: 10> Petitioner contends that the petition is properly brought under $ 2241, because Petitioner
<line: 11> invokes the savings clause in s 2255(e). The savings clause in s 2255(e) allows a prisoner to file.
<line: 12> a petition pursuant to $ 2241 in the *rare and exceptional circumstances" where his remedy.
<line: 13> under $ 2255 proves "inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention." Trenkler v.
<line: 14> United States, 536 F.3d 85, 96 (1st Cir. 2008). Here, Petitioner has made no such showing

[TEXT]
<line: 16> [F]or the Court to have jurisdiction to consider a petition brought under the savings
<line: 17> clause, the prisoner must be able to either (1) "prove his actual innocence on the.
<line: 18> existing record"' and that he "could not have effectively raised his claim of.
<line: 19> innocence at an earlier time," Barrett, 178 F.3d at 52 (internal quotation marks.
<line: 20> omitted) (quoting Triestman v. United States, 124 F.3d 361, 363, 377-78 (2d Cir..
<line: 21> 1997)); or (2) prove that a "complete miscarriage of justice" would result if the
<line: 22> petition is denied, Calvache, 183 F. Supp. 2d at 127 (citing In re Dorsainvil, 119
<line: 23> F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir. 1997)).

<line: 25> Henderson v. Grondolosky, No. 16-12459-DJC, 2017 WL 4038392, at *3 (D. Mass. Sept. 12,
<line: 26> 2017). "Relief under  2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because  2255 relief has
<line: 27> already been denied." Id. (internal quotations omitted).

[TEXT]
<line: 29> Petitioner does not allege that he is innocent of his three underlying drug convictions. He.
<line: 30> argues instead that his three prior convictions no longer qualify him as a career offender in light
<line: 31> of Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243 (2016), Descamps v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2276
<line: 32> (2013) and Begay v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 158 (2008). He asserts that his categorization as a
<line: 33> career offender was "a complete miscarriage of justice in violation of his rights to due process of.
<line: 34> law," and that he should be able "to obtain relief based on the substantive change in law by the..

<line: 2> Supreme Court in [Mathis, Descamps, and Begay']." But this challenge remains a challenge to
<line: 3> the validity of his sentence. Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider this petition
<line: 4> under 28 U.S.C.  2255(e).

<line: 9> For the foregoing reasons, Respondent's Motion to Dismiss is ALLOwED and
