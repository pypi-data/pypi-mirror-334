[TITLE]
<line: 29> JOINT MOTION TO STAY DISCOVERY 

[TEXT]
<line: 31> Defendant TrueAccord Corp. (“TrueAccord”) and Plaintiff William Deiker, by and 
<line: 32> through their respective undersigned counsel and pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), hereby move 
<line: 33> for a stay of discovery pending ruling on Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings [Dkt. 
<line: 34> #36], and in support of which state as follows: 

[TEXT]
<line: 36> 1. The Court enjoys broad discretion in controlling discovery. McCarthy v. Option One 
<line: 37> Mortg. Corp., 362 F.3d 1008, 1112 (7th Cir. 2004). 
<line: 38> 2. Indeed, “court[s] may, for good cause, issue an order to protect a party or person from 
<line: 39> annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense[.]” Fed. R. Civ. P. 
<line: 40> 26(c). Therefore, Rule 26(c) provides the Court with discretion to enter an order staying 
<line: 41> discovery for good cause. 
<line: 42> 3. Courts routinely stay discovery obligations when a motion for judgment on the 
<line: 43> pleadings is pending. See e.g., Mid-Century Ins. Co. v. Pizza By Marchelloni, 2018 
<line: 44> U.S. Dist. LEXIS 228717, *4 (C.D. Ill. Mar. 21, 2018) (staying discovery pending 
<line: 45> resolution of motions for judgment on the pleadings); Andrew Corp. v. Beverly Mfg.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> Co., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47213, *2 (N.D. Ill. June 10, 2005) (noting court's decision 
<line: 5> to stay discovery on claims pending ruling on motion for judgment on the pleadings).   

[TEXT]
<line: 7> 4. A stay is particularly warranted here where Defendant’s motion for judgment on the 
<line: 8> pleadings is premised solely on the allegations in the complaint (rather than factual 
<line: 9> issues in dispute) and if granted will resolve this case in its entirety.  

[TEXT]
<line: 11> 5. Because the need for discovery would be extinguished by a favorable ruling on the 
<line: 12> motion for judgment on the pleadings, the parties should be protected from completing 
<line: 13> costly discovery depositions pending ruling.  

[TEXT]
<line: 15> WHEREFORE, the Parties respectfully request that this Court stay discovery pending 
<line: 16> ruling on Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings and for such other and further relief 
<line: 17> as this Court deems just.

<line: 19> Respectfully submitted,
