<line: 26> ORDER

[TEXT]
<line: 28> For the reasons stated below, plaintiff’s motion [66] for summary judgment is granted in part and
<line: 29> denied in part.  Plaintiff’s motion is granted as to the sum of $41,431.58 from the proceeds of the
<line: 30> “Contents Check”.  Otherwise, plaintiff’s motion is denied.  Reff’s motion [70] for summary judgment is
<line: 31> granted.  Fishburn is ordered to deliver  the sum of $41,431.58 from the proceeds of the “Contents
<line: 32> Check” to plaintiff.  Fishburn is directed to deliver the proceeds from the “Building Check” and $550.00
<line: 33> from the proceeds of the “Contents Check” to Reff Properties, LLC.  It appears that this order moots
<line: 34> Reff’s third-party action against the Insurance Defendants and Smith.  Reff shall file a motion to dismiss
<line: 35> the third-party action or notify the court that it intends to proceed with that action – with an explanation
<line: 36> as to why the action is not moot – on or before August 21, 2015.

[TITLE]
<line: 38> STATEMENT-OPINION

[TEXT]
<line: 40> Plaintiff, Daniel M. Donahue, trustee of the bankruptcy estate of Pinewood Buffet & Grill, Inc.
<line: 41> (“Pinewood”), brings this action for declaratory judgment against defendants, Jennifer Smith, Reff
<line: 42> Properties, LLC (“Reff”), and Dan G. Fishburn1.  Plaintiff seeks a declaration that certain funds held by
<line: 43> Fishburn are the property of the bankruptcy estate (Count I) and further asks the court to order Fishburn
<line: 44> to turnover these funds to the bankruptcy estate (Count II).  The funds at issue are the proceeds of
<line: 45> insurance paid as the result of a fire at a restaurant owned and operated by Pinewood in a building it
<line: 46> leased from Reff.  Smith, who is a lender to Pinewood, agrees with plaintiff that these proceeds belong to
<line: 47> the bankruptcy estate.  Reff denies plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that the funds belong to the
<line: 48> bankruptcy estate.  Reff also filed a counterclaim asserting the funds belong to it and, that to the extent
<line: 49> the estate has an interest in these funds, that interest is subject to a constructive trust or equitable lien in
<line: 50> favor of Reff.  Plaintiff [66] and Reff [70] each move for summary judgment denying the other’s claims
<line: 51> and granting their own.

[ABANDON]
<line: 53> 1  Fishburn is named only in his capacity as the trustee under an attorneys trust account agreement which is
<line: 54> holding the funds which are at issue in this case.

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Also pending, is a third party claim by Reff against Bauer Group Agency, Ltd. (“Bauer”),
<line: 3> Michael Woodward, Auto-Owners Insurance (“Auto-Owners”) (collectively, “Insurance Defendants”),
<line: 4> and Smith.  This claim is not at issue in the summary judgment motions.  However, Bauer and
<line: 5> Woodward have filed a memorandum in support of Reff’s summary judgment motion.

[TEXT]
<line: 7> Todd and Amy Reid were the sole shareholders of Pinewood.  Bauer was a disclosed agent of
<line: 8> Auto-Owners authorized to issue insurance binders on Auto-Owners’s behalf.  Woodward was a licensed
<line: 9> insurance producer in Illinois working for Bauer.

[TEXT]
<line: 11> In August 2009, Reff purchased a building in Freeport, Illinois along with certain equipment
<line: 12> paying $340,000.  $225,000 of the purchase price was allocated to the building and $115,000 to the
<line: 13> equipment.  One year later, in August 2010, Pinewood entered a lease with Reff for the real property and
<line: 14> equipment.  The lease required Pinewood to provide fire and casualty insurance on the leased premises
<line: 15> with Reff as the named insured and liability and dram shop insurance with Reff named as an additional
<line: 16> insured.  Pinewood worked with Woodward to obtain insurance on the premises from Auto-Owners
<line: 17> through its agent, Bauer.  At some point, Woodward advised Amy that Reff could not be identified as the
<line: 18> “named insured” on the proposed policy because Pinewood would be the entity paying the premiums.  

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Smith lent Pinewood $100,000 to start its business evidenced by a promissory note.  Smith’s loan
<line: 21> to Pinewood was unsecured.  Prior to making the loan to Pinewood, Smith indicated to Pinewood’s
<line: 22> owners that she wanted to be secured in connection with her anticipated loan and raised the topic of
<line: 23> insurance.  Amy advised Smith that Amy had spoken with Woodward who had told Amy that Smith
<line: 24> could be added to the insurance policy.  Smith assumed that if she was identified in the insurance policy,
<line: 25> in the event of a casualty, Reff would receive the fair market value of the building and then she would be
<line: 26> paid the balance of her loan.  Todd testified that approximately a week before the execution of the lease
<line: 27> agreement with Reff, Todd had a discussion with Woodward.  From this discussion, Todd understood
<line: 28> Reff was to be the beneficiary of the building and personal property portion of the contemplated
<line: 29> insurance policy.

[TEXT]
<line: 31> An insurance binder, dated August 10, 2010, was issued by Bauer with an effective date of
<line: 32> August 11, 2010 and expiration date of September 10, 2010 listing Pinewood as the insured.  The binder
<line: 33> bound coverage for property insurance (with coverage forms for “Building, Business Contents, Sign,
<line: 34> Food Spoilage”.)  It also bound coverage for commercial general liability, excess liability, and workers’
<line: 35> compensation and employer’s liability coverages.  Reff was listed on the binder and its interest was
<line: 36> indicated by check marks being placed in 3 separate boxes one each labeled respectively “mortgagee”,
<line: 37> “loss payee”, and “additional insured”.  An additional binder, dated August 10, 2010, was also issued by
<line: 38> Bauer with an effective date of August 11, 2010 and expiration date of September 10, 2010 listing
<line: 39> Pinewood as the insured.  It was identical to the other binder except that Reff was not listed and, instead,
<line: 40> Smith was listed as loss payee.  An insurance application was made on behalf of Pinewood in which
<line: 41> Pinewood is listed as the named insured, Smith as an additional interest of “loss payee” and Reff as an
<line: 42> additional interest of “mortgagee”.  When the policy itself was issued by Auto-Owners, however, it did
<line: 43> not list Reff as the named insured (as called for by the lease) or as mortgagee, loss payee and additional
<line: 44> insured as provided in the binder.  The policy listed Pinewood as the insured and listed only Smith in the
<line: 45> section “secured interested parties and/or additional interested parties.”  Smith’s interest is identified as
<line: 46> “loss payable”.  The policy was for the period August 11, 2010 to August 11, 2011.  Todd and Amy
<line: 47> received a copy of this policy but did not read it. 

[ABANDON]
<line: 49> 2

[TEXT]
<line: 2>  A fire occurred on June 2, 2011.  On June 3, 2011, Reff’s owner (Peter Reff) and Pinewood’s
<line: 3> owners were told by Peter Salm, the insurance adjuster for Auto- Owners, that Reff was not named on the
<line: 4> insurance policy as either the named insured or in any other capacity.   Subsequently, on June 14, 2011, a
<line: 5> change endorsement to the policy was made.  The change is described on a policy declaration page as:
<line: 6> “added the following mortgagee: Reff Properties.”  The declaration page notes “Change Endorsement
<line: 7> Effective 08-11-2010."  August 11, 2010 was the original effective date of the policy and the binders
<line: 8> mentioned above.  As set forth above,  Reff did not hold a mortgage on the property.  Reff owned the
<line: 9> property and leased it to Pinewood.  At no time after June 2, 2011 but prior to June 14, 2011 did anyone
<line: 10> have any discussion with Smith about adding Reff to the insurance policy post-fire.

[TEXT]
<line: 12> On November 29, 2011 Auto-Owners issued a check (“Building Check”) in the sum of
<line: 13> $439,252.33 payable to Pinewood, Reff, and Smith for the “actual cash value of building less deductible
<line: 14> and mitigation.”  On that date, Auto-Owners also issued a check (“Contents Check”) in the amount of
<line: 15> $41,981.58 payable to Pinewood and Reff for the “actual cash value of contents less mitigation.”2  

[TEXT]
<line: 17> In February 2012, the parties deposited these checks into Fishburn’s trust account pursuant to an
<line: 18> attorneys trust account agreement (“Trust Agreement”) dated “February __, 2012.”  The Trust
<line: 19> Agreement provides in relevant part that the Building Check is “to be disbursed as directed pursuant to a
<line: 20> written agreement executed by Pinewood Buffet & Grill, Inc., Reff Properties, LLC and Jennifer Smith,
<line: 21> or in lieu thereof, pursuant to court order.”  The Trust Agreement further provides that the “parties hereto
<line: 22> agree that this Agreement is entered into for the purposes of facilitating receipt of said checks from the
<line: 23> Insurance company pending resolution of current issues between the parties and said sum as held in said
<line: 24> trust account shall have the same legal character for all purposes as when held by the insurance company
<line: 25> subject to the terms of the relevant insurance policy.”    

[TEXT]
<line: 27> No agreement was reached and eventually Pinewood filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on
<line: 28> August 30, 2012.  Reff, meanwhile, had sold the building and equipment on June 29, 2012 for $40,000. 
<line: 29> Plaintiff, as bankruptcy trustee,  filed the present case as an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy case. 
<line: 30> Reff filed counterclaims and the third-party action against the Insurance Defendants. This court, by order
<line: 31> [12] entered April 9, 2014, granted Reff’s motion to withdraw the reference of the adversary proceeding
<line: 32> from the bankruptcy court.

[TEXT]
<line: 34> Plaintiff claims the bankruptcy estate is entitled to the funds held under the Trust Agreement
<line: 35> because the funds are proceeds of an insurance policy under which, at the time of the loss, Pinewood, not
<line: 36> Reff, was the named insured.  Reff claims it is entitled to the insurance proceeds because Pinewood was
<line: 37> contractually obligated under the lease to provide insurance on the premises with Reff as the named
<line: 38> insured and because, pursuant to the June 14, 2011 change endorsement, Reff was insured under the
<line: 39> policy at the time of the loss.  Bauer and Woodward support Reff arguing the insurance policy should be
<line: 40> reformed to conform to the intent of the parties.

[ABANDON]
<line: 42> 2  Reff is only claiming $550.00 from the $41,981.58 check.  It is undisputed the rest belongs to the
<line: 43> bankruptcy estate as it was for Pinewood’s contents damaged by the fire and not Reff’s equipment that had been
<line: 44> leased to Pinewood.  Reff claims the $550.00 is for damage to a sign which Reff claims it owned.  The $550.00 is the
<line: 45> actual cash value of the loss to the sign as determined by the insurance adjuster.

[ABANDON]
<line: 47> 3

[TEXT]
<line: 2> The insurance policy issued by Auto-Owners, for purposes relevant here, included ISO Building
<line: 3> and Personal Property Coverage Form CP 00 10 10 91 (Dkt. # 73-6, p. 71).  That form provides in
<line: 4> paragraph  E. 4. c: “We will not pay you more than your financial interest in the Covered Property.” (Dkt.
<line: 5> # 73-6, p. 77).  “You” means the named insured.  Paragraph E. 4. d. provides: “We may adjust losses
<line: 6> with the owners of lost or damaged property if other than you.  If we pay the owners, such payments will
<line: 7> satisfy your claims against us for the owners’ property.  We will not pay the owners more than their
<line: 8> financial interest in the Covered Property.” (Dkt. # 73-6, p.77).  The Loss Payable Provisions
<line: 9> endorsement (Form CP 12 18 10 91) to the Building and Personal Property Coverage Form provides:
<line: 10> “For covered Property in which both you and a Loss Payee shown in the Schedule or in the Declarations
<line: 11> have an Insurable Interest, we will: 1. Adjust losses with you; and 2. Pay any claim for loss or damage
<line: 12> jointly to you and the Loss Payee, as interests may appear.” (Dkt. # 73-6, p.85) The “Lender’s Loss
<line: 13> Payable” provisions of that endorsement provide: “For Covered Property in which both you and a Loss
<line: 14> Payee have an Insurable Interest: a. We will pay for covered loss or damage to each Loss Payee in their
<line: 15> order of precedence, as Interests may appear.”  (Dkt. # 73-6, p.86)    

[TEXT]
<line: 17> The commencement of a bankruptcy case creates an estate which includes “all legal or equitable
<line: 18> interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.” 11 U.S..C. § 541(a)(1). 
<line: 19> “Property in which the debtor holds, as of the commencement of the case, only legal title and not an
<line: 20> equitable interest . . . becomes property of the estate . . . only to the extent of the debtor’s legal title to
<line: 21> such property, but not to the extent of any equitable interest in such property that the debtor does not
<line: 22> hold.” 11 U.S.C. § 541(d).  “[S]tate law defines the ‘property’ that enters the bankruptcy estate, unless a
<line: 23> provision of the Bankruptcy Code displaces state law.” Peterson v. McGladrey & Pullen, LLP, 676 F.3d
<line: 24> 594, 598 (7th Cir. 2012).  It is the job of the court in a bankruptcy case, “to gather all of the debtor’s
<line: 25> assets, as state law defines those assets, and distribute them according to the creditors’ rights under state
<line: 26> law,” absent some alteration by the bankruptcy code. Id.    

[TEXT]
<line: 28> As of the commencement of Pinewood’s bankruptcy case, the Trust Agreement was in effect
<line: 29> among Pinewood, Reff and Smith.  Pinewood’s bankruptcy estate, therefore, includes any interest
<line: 30> Pinewood has under the Trust Agreement.  The Trust Agreement expressly provides that the funds held
<line: 31> under it “have the same legal character for all purposes as when held by the insurance company subject
<line: 32> to the terms of the relevant insurance policy.”  The court looks first to Illinois law to determine the
<line: 33> estate’s interest in the insurance proceeds. 

[TEXT]
<line: 35>  Under Illinois law, a “contract of insurance is established if one of the parties to such a contract
<line: 36> proposes to be insured and the other party agrees to insure, and the subject, the amount, and the rate of
<line: 37> insurance are ascertained or understood and the premium paid if demanded.” Zannini v. Reliance Ins.
<line: 38> Co., 590 N.E.2d 457, 464 (Ill. 1992) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  An ‘agent
<line: 39> possessing power to bind the insurer has authority to bind it by a preliminary or temporary contract of
<line: 40> insurance.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  There is no dispute that Bauer, acting
<line: 41> through Woodward, had the authority to bind coverage for Auto-Owners.  “An insurer can speak only
<line: 42> through its representatives.  The words of a representative who speaks to a potential insured are those of
<line: 43> the insurer and the insurer is bound by the representative’s words.” Id., at 465.  “Where an agent is
<line: 44> authorized to act, and through his mistake or fraud, the policy fails to express the real contract between
<line: 45> the parties, or, if by inadvertence, negligence or mistake of the agent, provisions other than those
<line: 46> intended are inserted, or stipulated provisions are omitted, there is no doubt as to the power of the court
<line: 47> of equity to grant relief by reformation of the contract.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation
<line: 48> omitted).

[ABANDON]
<line: 50> 4

[TEXT]
<line: 2> There is no dispute that Pinewood intended that Reff would be covered by the insurance policy it
<line: 3> obtained.  The lease clearly obligated Pinewood to provide such insurance.  Pinewood’s owners acted to
<line: 4> provide insurance covering Reff and believed they had done so.  Bauer provided an insurance binder,
<line: 5> executed by Woodward, binding Auto-Owners to insure not only Pinewood but also including Reff as
<line: 6> mortgagee, loss payee, and additional insured.  When the policy was issued it did not include Reff in any
<line: 7> of these capacities.  This omission was clearly an error and contrary to the intent of Pinewood and the
<line: 8> insurer as evidenced by the binder.

[TEXT]
<line: 10> The “Loss Payable Provisions” endorsement  (Dkt. # 73-6, p.85) to the “Building and Personal
<line: 11> Property Coverage Form” of the policy actually issued provides: “For covered Property in which both
<line: 12> you and a Loss Payee shown in the Schedule or in the Declarations have an Insurable Interest, we will: 1.
<line: 13> Adjust losses with you; and 2. Pay any claim for loss or damage jointly to you and the Loss Payee, as
<line: 14> interests may appear.”  Reff, as the owner of the real estate, clearly had an insurable interest in the
<line: 15> property.  Had the loss occurred after the binder was issued but before the policy was issued Reff
<line: 16> obviously would have been entitled to payment as loss payee as its interest appeared.  There is no
<line: 17> evidence anyone intended the issued policy to vary from the binder.  All of the undisputed evidence on
<line: 18> summary judgment shows Reff’s omission was a mistake of the agent or the insurer, not an intentional
<line: 19> decision on the part of any of the individuals or entities involved.

[TEXT]
<line: 21> Plaintiff argues the insurance policy as issued clearly does not provide coverage for Reff. 
<line: 22> Plaintiff contends that since the binder was, by its own terms, canceled when it was replaced by the
<line: 23> policy, Reff was not covered by the insurance once the policy was issued.   Plaintiff relies on the well-
<line: 24> settled rule that in interpreting an insurance policy (or any contract) the clear and unambiguous terms of
<line: 25> the policy control. See Pekin Ins. Co. v. Precision Dose, Inc., 968 N.E.2d 664, 673 (Ill. App. 2012). 
<line: 26> Nowhere in the policy does language appear saying Reff is insured.  The binder’s language
<line: 27> unambiguously states the binder was canceled when the policy was issued.  The fire occurred after the
<line: 28> policy was issued so, according to plaintiff, under the plain language of the binder and the policy, Reff
<line: 29> was no longer insured at the time of the loss.  

[TEXT]
<line: 31> The plain language of the policy also says “[w]e will not pay you [“you” being the named
<line: 32> insured] more than your financial interest in the Covered Property.” (Dkt. # 73-6, p. 77).  Plaintiff has
<line: 33> presented no evidence to support a claim Pinewood had a financial interest in the Covered Property
<line: 34> worth the $439,252.33 paid by the insurer.  The insurance adjuster’s claim report (Dkt. # 73-5, pp. 102-
<line: 35> 140) indicates a replacement cash value (“RCV”) of $724,101.41 less depreciation of $282,092.18 for an
<line: 36> actual cash value (“ACV”) of the loss under the commercial property coverage as $442,009.23.  (Under
<line: 37> the terms of the policy the Covered Property is valued at “actual cash value at the time of the loss.”3 
<line: 38> (Dkt. # 73-6, p.78).)  The adjuster’s claim report gives a detailed breakdown of the  RCV and ACV of
<line: 39> each item calculated in estimating the loss.  The total ACV for the exterior of the building is $80,287.79
<line: 40> and the total for the main level of the building is $360,647.38, which totals $440,935.17.  These items all
<line: 41> relate to the building.  There is no dispute Reff not Pinewood owned the building.  The lease required
<line: 42> Pinewood to maintain insurance “insuring the leased Premises against any damage by fire or other

[ABANDON]
<line: 44> 3  The policy provides for an optional replacement cost coverage. (Dkt. # 73-6, p.60) Under that optional
<line: 45> coverage, “Replacement Cost; (without deduction for depreciation) replaces Actual Cash Value” in determining the
<line: 46> amount of the loss. (Dkt. # 73-6, p.82).  However, the difference between ACV and RCV would not be paid under
<line: 47> the policy until the “lost or damaged property is actually repaired or replaced.” (Dkt. # 73-6, p.82).  The property
<line: 48> here was not actually repaired or replaced so ACV not RCV is the proper valuation on these facts.

[TEXT]
<line: 2> casualty to its full insurable value” naming Reff the named insured on the policy.  This lease language is
<line: 3> a strong indication that the financial interest in the building was Reff’s.  The evidence available on
<line: 4> summary judgment does not show Pinewood had a financial interest in the Covered Property to support a
<line: 5> claim that the insurance proceeds for the loss to the building were properly payable to it. 

[TEXT]
<line: 7> Reff also contends the policy was reformed by the June 14, 2011 change endorsement naming
<line: 8> Reff as a covered mortgagee as of August 11, 2010, the date the binder was issued.  Plaintiff argues the
<line: 9> change endorsement was ineffective because the policy could not be reformed after the loss, the change
<line: 10> incorrectly identified Reff as a mortgagee (not as a lessor) and because Smith did not consent to the
<line: 11> change.

[TEXT]
<line: 13> Smith’s lack of consent is not a basis for finding the change endorsement ineffective.  While the
<line: 14> binder which included Smith designated her as a loss payee, and the policy that was issued listed Smith’s
<line: 15> interest as “loss payable”, the evidence before the court here on summary judgment fails to show Smith
<line: 16> had an insurable interest in the property.  The leased premises was owned by Reff and leased to
<line: 17> Pinewood.  Smith had no security interest in any property, real or personal, of Pinewood’s or Reff’s. 
<line: 18> While Todd and Amy and Pinewood were obligated to Smith on a promissory note, this debt was not
<line: 19> secured by any collateral.  The policy’s “Loss Payable Provisions” endorsement provides that where both
<line: 20> the insured (Pinewood) and a loss payee have an insurable interest in covered property, the insurer will
<line: 21> pay any claim for loss jointly to Pinewood and the loss payee as interests may appear.  Without an
<line: 22> insurable interest in the property, Smith, a general unsecured creditor, was not entitled under the policy
<line: 23> to any payment for any damage to the property.  Third Establishment, Inc. v. 1931 North Park
<line: 24> Apartments, 417 N.E.2d 167, 172 (Ill. App. 1981) (a general creditor has no claim on insurance
<line: 25> proceeds); see generally, 44 Am. Jur. 2d Insurance § 964 (Database Updated May 2015) (“creditor
<line: 26> without a lien either statutory or contract and owning a mere personal claim against the debtor, does not
<line: 27> have an insurable interest in the property of the debtor.”)  Smith’s consent to the June 14, 2011 change
<line: 28> endorsement was not required because Smith had no cognizable interest under the policy.

[TEXT]
<line: 30> Reff, on the other hand, did have an insurable interest in the property as the owner/lessor.   Reff
<line: 31> was designated in the binder as a mortgagee, loss payee, and additional insured.  Reff was designated in
<line: 32> the application as a mortgagee and also in the June 14, 2011 change endorsement.  The “Loss Payable
<line: 33> Provisions” endorsement to the policy contains “Lender’s Loss Payable” provisions.  The “Lender’s Loss
<line: 34> Payable” provisions apply where the designated loss payee is “a creditor, including a mortgageholder or
<line: 35> trustee whose interest in the Covered Property is established by such written instruments as . . .
<line: 36> [m]ortgages, deeds of trust, or security agreements.” (Dkt # 73-6, p. 86)   The “Lender’s Loss Payable”
<line: 37> provisions convey more rights on a creditor loss payee than on a non-creditor loss payee – particularly by
<line: 38> granting a creditor loss payee the right to receive payment for a loss even under circumstances where the
<line: 39> named insured’s claim would have been denied due to the named insured’s failure to comply with certain
<line: 40> terms of the policy.  While a lease is not specifically identified in the list of “such written instruments
<line: 41> as,” Reff was a creditor of Pinewood under the lease, the leased property was Covered Property under the
<line: 42> policy, and Reff owned the Covered Property.  In light of these facts, the use of the term “mortgagee” in
<line: 43> the change endorsement is consistent with an intent to correct the policy to conform it to the binder by
<line: 44> naming Reff a loss payee under the “Loss Payable Provisions” endorsement. 

[TEXT]
<line: 46>  Nothing precludes the insurer from acting voluntarily to conform the policy to the agreement of
<line: 47> the parties as evidenced in the binder even after the loss.  At the time of the change, no other party’s
<line: 48> interests were adversely affected because only Pinewood, Reff, and the insurer had any actual interest in

[ABANDON]
<line: 50> 6

[TEXT]
<line: 2> the insurance contract.  Plaintiff cites the Third Establishment case referenced above for the proposition
<line: 3> that Reff could not be added as a new insured post-fire because the interest and right of the insured are
<line: 4> fixed as of the date of the loss.  However, Third Establishment does not so hold.  Third Establishment
<line: 5> involved a claim by a building owner/lessor on the proceeds of insurance paid for damage to trade
<line: 6> fixtures and building contents which were not owned by the lessor. The lessee owned the contents.  The
<line: 7> lease required the lessee to carry insurance on “furniture and fixtures” but did not require that the lessor
<line: 8> be named as an insured or loss payee on this insurance, nor provide that the proceeds should be paid to
<line: 9> lessor.  The court stated “the contents did not belong to the lessor.  If they were destroyed the lessor
<line: 10> would suffer no loss from the destruction.” Id.  The court noted that since the amount of rent payable to
<line: 11> lessor was determined in part by the amount of lessee’s gross sales “it was a matter of concern to the
<line: 12> lessor that the lessee, in the event of fire, be able to resume business promptly.” Id.  So, the lessor had an
<line: 13> interest in requiring the lessee to carry insurance on the contents to provide lessee the necessary funds to
<line: 14> replace the contents and resume business but that was distinct from having an insurable interest in the
<line: 15> contents themselves.  The Third Establishment lessor had no insurable interest in the property.  While the
<line: 16> lessee who did have such an interest could have assigned the insurance proceeds to the lessor, it did not
<line: 17> do so and the court declined to construe the lease as requiring such an assignment. Id.  Third
<line: 18> Establishment does not hold that an insurer and its insured cannot agree to reform an insurance policy
<line: 19> after a loss to correct a mistake. 

[TEXT]
<line: 21> Plaintiff maintains section 544(a) of the bankruptcy code entitles the estate to the funds held
<line: 22> under the Trust Agreement and prevents reformation of the policy because such reformation would
<line: 23> impair the trustee’s avoiding powers under section 544.  Section 544(a) provides that a bankruptcy
<line: 24> trustee shall have, as of the commencement of the bankruptcy case, “the rights and powers of, or may
<line: 25> avoid any transfer of property of the debtor or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable by –
<line: 26> (1) a creditor that extends credit to the debtor at the time of the commencement of the case, and that
<line: 27> obtains, at such time and with respect to such credit, a judicial lien on all property on which a creditor on
<line: 28> a simple contract could have obtained such a judicial lien, whether or not such a creditor exists; (2) a
<line: 29> creditor that extends credit to the debtor at the time of the commencement of the case, and obtains, at
<line: 30> such time and with respect to such credit, an execution against debtor that is returned unsatisfied at such
<line: 31> time, whether or not such a creditor exists.”  As of the commencement of Pinewood’s bankruptcy case,
<line: 32> therefore, plaintiff obtained the rights and powers that would have been possessed by these hypothetical
<line: 33> creditors of Pinewood as of the commencement date.  Thus, besides whatever interest in the funds held
<line: 34> under the Trust Agreement the estate obtained under section 541, the trustee may also assert whatever
<line: 35> rights a hypothetical section 544(a)(1) or (2) creditor of Pinewood would have in those funds.

[TEXT]
<line: 37> Under Illinois law, there are a number of ways a “judicial lien” can be created on a judgment
<line: 38> debtor’s interest in property.  Delivering a certified copy of a judgment to the sheriff for service on the
<line: 39> debtor creates an execution lien on debtor’s interest in goods and chattels. 735 ILCS 5/12-111.  Serving a
<line: 40> non-wage garnishment (735 ILCS 5/12-707(a)) or citation to discover assets (735 ILCS 5/2-1402(m)
<line: 41> creates a lien on nonexempt property of the judgment debtor held by the garnishee (“indebtedness or
<line: 42> other property”) or party served with the citation (“personal property, including money, choses in action,
<line: 43> and effects”).  So, for example, a hypothetical creditor serving a citation to discover assets or a non-wage
<line: 44> garnishment on Fishburn as of the commencement of Pinewood’s bankruptcy case would have obtained a
<line: 45> lien on Pinewood’s interest in the funds held under the Trust Agreement.  Fishburn would have been
<line: 46> precluded from transferring Pinewood’s interest in the funds.  Where, as here, another party claims an
<line: 47> interest in the funds, the rights of the adverse claimant must be determined by the court in an adverse

<line: 5> Since the trustee obtained hypothetical lien creditor status as of the filing of the bankruptcy case,
<line: 6> more than a year after the voluntary reformation by the insurer effected by the June 14, 2011 change
<line: 7> endorsement,  Reff already had an interest in the funds prior to the bankruptcy filing.  A section 544
<line: 8> hypothetical lien creditor’s lien would not extend to Reff’s interest in the property.  Plaintiff’s avoiding
<line: 9> powers under section 544, therefore, were not impaired by the June 14, 2011 change endorsement.

[TEXT]
<line: 11> Even if the June 14, 2011 change endorsement were found not to be effective, Bauer and
<line: 12> Woodward argue reformation of the policy by the court to conform it to the intent of the parties is
<line: 13> appropriate now.  As noted above, the evidence shows everyone involved in the transaction (Pinewood’s
<line: 14> owners, Woodward, Reff, and Smith ) agrees Reff was intended to be a covered loss payee under the
<line: 15> policy.  In Zannini, quoted above, Zannini contacted Nesslar, an agent for Reliance, to obtain renter’s
<line: 16> insurance including coverage for jewelry in an amount up to $25,000.  Nesslar orally bound coverage for
<line: 17> Zannini with Reliance.  Zannini received a written policy from Reliance but stated “he probably did not
<line: 18> read it and did not notice any discrepancy in coverage between the written policy and the coverage
<line: 19> Nesslar said he would obtain.” Zannini, 590 N.E.2d at 459.  Zannini suffered a loss of jewelry,
<line: 20> apparently by theft, and made a claim under the policy.  However, the policy Zannini received from
<line: 21> Reliance provided a $500 limit for loss of jewelry.  After Zannini made the claim, Nesslar realized he had
<line: 22> not given Reliance the schedule of jewelry.  He advised Reliance that he had bound coverage for the
<line: 23> jewelry but had failed to give Reliance the schedule of jewelry.  Reliance denied coverage based on
<line: 24> Nesslar’s failure to notify Reliance within seven days of binding coverage as required by the agency
<line: 25> agreement between Nesslar and Reliance.  It was undisputed that Zannini and Nesslar intended that the
<line: 26> policy would include coverage for scheduled jewelry up to $25,000 and that “Nesslar agreed to and
<line: 27> purported to bind such coverage.” Id., at 460.  On these facts, the court held that a contract for insurance
<line: 28> was formed between Reliance and Zannini based on the oral binder by Nesslar  and that the contract
<line: 29> included coverage for the jewelry. Id., at 465.  The court reformed the insurance policy to conform it to
<line: 30> the contract the parties actually entered.

[TEXT]
<line: 32> The factual situation here is analogous to the factual situation in Zannini.  Bauer through
<line: 33> Woodward bound coverage which included Reff as a loss payee.  The policy failed to match the coverage
<line: 34> that had been bound.  The insured received the policy but failed to read it.  A loss occurred and the error
<line: 35> in coverage was discovered when the policy was examined in connection with the making of a claim
<line: 36> under the policy.  Applying Zannini to these facts, the policy would be reformed to show Reff as a loss
<line: 37> payee under the policy at the time of the loss as it was clearly the intent of the parties to the contract at
<line: 38> the time it was formed to make Reff a loss payee.4  As a loss payee under the policy at the time of the
<line: 39> loss, under Illinois law, Reff would be entitled to payment of its claim as its interest appeared at that
<line: 40> time.   This interest of Reff’s, therefore, would attach to the funds held under the Trust Agreement as
<line: 41> well.  Pinewood’s interest in the funds held under the Trust Agreement would include only those funds
<line: 42> that were not payable to Reff as loss payee under the insurance contract.

<line: 44> 4  As noted above, Smith does not claim she is entitled to any of the insurance proceeds though she was
<line: 45> named a loss payee in one of the insurance binders and had her interest identified in the policy as “loss payable”.  As
<line: 46> discussed above, Smith was an unsecured creditor of Pinewood and lacked an insurable interest in the subject
<line: 47> property.  Without an insurable interest, Smith was not eligible to receive payment as a loss payee under the terms of
<line: 48> the policy. Dkt. # 73-6, p.85.

<line: 2> Does section 544 prevent the court from making this reformation to the policy?  A hypothetical
<line: 3> lien creditor would have a lien on Pinewood’s property as of the commencement of the bankruptcy case. 
<line: 4> At that point, Pinewood owned whatever interest it possessed under the Trust Agreement.  The Trust
<line: 5> Agreement provides that the funds held have “the same legal character for all purposes as when held by
<line: 6> the insurance company subject to the terms of the relevant insurance policy.”  The policy provides the
<line: 7> insurer will not pay the insured more than the insured’s financial interest in the covered property.  As set
<line: 8> out above, the evidence on summary judgment does not show Pinewood had a financial interest in the
<line: 9> property and, therefore, in the funds to the extent of the $439,252.33 Building Check transferred into the
<line: 10> trust.  The adjuster’s claim report showed an ACV for the damage to the building of  $440,935.17.  Reff
<line: 11> owned the building.  A lien creditor filing a garnishment or serving a citation to discover assets on
<line: 12> Fishburn as trustee would have a lien only on Pinewood’s interest in the funds and the determination of
<line: 13> that interest would be subject to an adverse claim trial in which Reff could prove its claim to the funds
<line: 14> and obtain a judgment awarding it its interest. 735 ILCS 5/12-710(b);735 ILCS 5/2-1402(g).  Nothing in
<line: 15> Illinois law appears to bar an adverse claimant from establishing its claim to property via proving its right
<line: 16> to reformation of a contract.

[TEXT]
<line: 18> Plaintiff cites a number of cases involving errors in recorded mortgages which he argues show
<line: 19> Section 544 bars reformation of the policy after the commencement of a bankruptcy case. In re Lawson,
<line: 20> Adv. No. 10-1330, 2011 WL 1167115 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. Mar. 28, 2011); In re Easter, 367 B.R. 608
<line: 21> (Bankr. S.D. Ohio 2007); In re White Beauty View, Inc., 81 B.R.290 (Bankr. M.D. Penn. 1988); In re
<line: 22> Berg, 387 B.R. 524 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2008); Wolters v. Flagstar Bank FSB, 429 B.R. 587 (Bankr. W.D.
<line: 23> Mich. 2010).   However, the rights and priorities of lienholders and bona fide purchasers in real estate are
<line: 24> determined under real estate recording law and have no application here.  Section 544(a)(3) grants a
<line: 25> bankruptcy trustee the rights and powers of a bona fide purchaser of real estate from the debtor “that
<line: 26> obtains the status of a bona fide purchaser and has perfected such transfer at the time of the
<line: 27> commencement of the case, whether or not such a purchaser exists.”  The trustee also has the rights and
<line: 28> powers of a hypothetical lien creditor in real estate conferred by Section 544(a)(1) and (2) set out above. 
<line: 29> As a general principle, under Illinois law, a bona fide purchaser of real estate from the debtor (see In re
<line: 30> Crane, 742 F.3d 702, 706 (7th Cir. 2013) (applying Illinois law)) or a judgment lien creditor who records
<line: 31> a memorandum of judgment (735 ILCS 5/12-101) will have priority over an unrecorded mortgage (or
<line: 32> other interest) or a recorded mortgage that is defective in such a way that it would fail to give notice to
<line: 33> someone searching the real estate records that it was an encumbrance on the debtor’s real estate. 
<line: 34> Pursuant to Section 544(a), the bankruptcy trustee is put into the same position as such a bona fide
<line: 35> purchaser or judgment lien creditor.  

[TEXT]
<line: 37> However, there is no system requiring a public recording or filing of a document to give notice to
<line: 38> the world of an interest as a loss payee under an insurance contract and, thus, perfect that interest against
<line: 39> subsequent purchasers or creditors.  As discussed above, a judgment creditor’s lien only attaches to the
<line: 40> interest the judgment debtor has in the insurance contract at the time the judgment lien is created.  A
<line: 41> reformation would not effect a transfer from Pinewood to Reff but only conform the policy issued to the
<line: 42> insurance contract entered.  Reff possessed its interest as loss payee all along and Pinewood never
<line: 43> possessed that interest.  Accordingly, Section 544 does not prevent reformation by the court as no
<line: 44> judgment lien possessed by a creditor of Pinewood would have attached to Reff’s interest in the
<line: 45> insurance proceeds.  Therefore, even if the June 14, 2011 change endorsement had not effectively
<line: 46> reformed the policy to make Reff a loss payee, the court would reform it now to do so, as that was clearly
<line: 47> the intent of the parties when they formed the insurance contract as evidenced by the binder.

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Reff also argues that if the estate has any interest in the funds, that interest is subject to a
<line: 3> constructive trust or equitable lien in favor of Reff.  However, as discussed above, the estate did not
<line: 4> obtain an interest in the funds held by Fishburn to the extent those funds are in payment for damage to
<line: 5> the building owned by Reff.  Therefore, neither a constructive trust nor equitable lien is appropriate or
<line: 6> necessary to establish Reff’s interest in the funds. 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Plaintiff argues that even if Reff is found to have an interest in the funds, that interest is no more
<line: 9> than $144,800, which is the fair market value of the property ($184,800 based on the tax assessor’s
<line: 10> assessment for the 2011 tax year) less the $40,000 Reff received when it sold the property.  Plaintiff
<line: 11> notes that the policy provides: “We will not pay the owners more than their financial interest in the
<line: 12> Covered Property.”  (Dkt. # 73-6, p.77).  

[TEXT]
<line: 14> Under the terms of the policy the Covered Property is valued at “actual cash value at the time of
<line: 15> the loss.”  (Dkt. # 73-6, p.78).  ACV, as discussed above, is the RCV minus depreciation.  The amount of
<line: 16> the Building Check tendered by the insurer is slightly less than the ACV of  $440,935.17 for the damage
<line: 17> to the exterior and main level of Reff’s building  as estimated in the adjuster’s claim report.  Auto-
<line: 18> Owners payment is consistent with its contractual obligation to pay ACV for the damage to Reff’s
<line: 19> building.  Auto-Owners has not claimed it was obligated to pay only some lesser amount.  Illinois courts
<line: 20> have rejected approaches for determining actual cash value other than the replacement cost less
<line: 21> depreciation method.  Carey v. American Family Brokerage, Inc., 909 N.E.2d 255, 263 (Ill. App. 2009). 
<line: 22> The “proper calculation of actual cash value under both Illinois law and the policy in the case at bar is
<line: 23> ‘replacement cost less depreciation.’” Id. 

[TEXT]
<line: 25>  Plaintiff appears to be advocating what has been characterized as the “broad evidence” test to
<line: 26> determine actual cash value.  “Under the ‘broad evidence’ test, consideration is given to every fact and
<line: 27> circumstance logically tending to establish the true economic value of damaged property, such as its
<line: 28> original cost; its obsolescence, both structural and functional; depreciation and deterioration to which it
<line: 29> has been subject; and the opinion of value given by qualified expert valuation witnesses.”  Id., at 263. 
<line: 30> The evidence plaintiff argues should be considered is the tax assessor’s valuation and the price Reff sold
<line: 31> the property for a year after the fire.  Plaintiff also references the portion of the purchase price allocated
<line: 32> to the building ($225,000) when Reff purchased the building and equipment.  However, the “broad
<line: 33> evidence” test has been expressly rejected by Illinois courts. Id.  Replacement cost less depreciation is
<line: 34> the applicable method for calculating actual cash value.

[TEXT]
<line: 36> Chicago Title & Trust Co. v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 511 F.2d 241 (7th Cir.
<line: 37> 1975), cited by plaintiff, does not require a different result.  In Chicago Title, the court recognized that in
<line: 38> Illinois, the replacement cost less depreciation method of determining actual cash value appears to be
<line: 39> “limited by the policy of the law that requires an insurable interest as a condition to recovery on a
<line: 40> contract of insurance.  If, at the time of the fire, the building no longer has any economic value, there can
<line: 41> be no insurable interest and therefore no recovery of damages.” Chicago Title, 511 F.2d at 246.  In
<line: 42> Chicago Title, the building was vacant, had already previously been damaged by fire and not repaired
<line: 43> before a second fire on which the claim was being made occurred, and had been subject to a state court
<line: 44> demolition suit for 21 months in which the state court had ordered the property to be boarded up and
<line: 45> secured.  Here, the building clearly had economic value to Reff.  It (along with certain equipment) was
<line: 46> leased to a tenant paying rent at the rate of $57,600 per year.  It housed an operating restaurant at the time
<line: 47> of the fire.  There is no evidence indicating the building lacked economic value at the time of the fire.
