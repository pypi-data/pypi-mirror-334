[TITLE]
<line: 32> REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION 

[TEXT]
<line: 34> Norma Oralia Pantoja and Janeth Adriana Barragan Cruz (“Plaintiffs”) commenced this 
<line: 35> civil action by filing a complaint on April 4, 2017 (Docket No. 4), in which they set out claims 
<line: 36> for relief under:  1) the Federal Civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act; 2) the 
<line: 37> Fair Labor Standards Act; 3) the Tennessee Public Protection Act; and 4) Tennessee common 
<line: 38> law. 

[TEXT]
<line: 40> Plaintiffs named five Defendants in their complaint.  However, four1 of these Defendants 
<line: 41> were dismissed from the action without prejudice under Rule 4(m) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
<line: 42> Procedure because Plaintiffs failed to serve process upon them.  See Order entered September 7, 
<line: 43> 2017 (Docket Entry No. 12).  Although Plaintiffs filed a return of service of summons indicating 
<line: 44> service on Defendant Jean Perez by certified mail delivered on April 8, 2017, see Docket Entry

[TEXT]
<line: 2> No. 8, Defendant Perez has not answered or otherwise responded to the complaint.  See Order 
<line: 3> entered September 15, 2017 (Docket Entry No. 13). 

[TEXT]
<line: 5> The Court set an initial case management conference for October 30, 2017.  See Order 
<line: 6> entered September 15, 2017 (Docket Entry No. 13).  However, neither counsel for Plaintiffs nor 
<line: 7> Defendant Perez, either pro se or through counsel, appeared at the case management conference.  
<line: 8> Additionally, neither party filed a proposed initial case management order prior to the hearing, as 
<line: 9> they had been directed to do by the Court, or contacted the Court in any manner about the case 
<line: 10> management conference or the case.  Accordingly, on October 31, 2017, the Court issued a show 
<line: 11> cause order requiring Plaintiffs to show cause by November 14, 2017, why a recommendation 
<line: 12> should not be made to the District Judge for dismissal of this case under Rule 41(b) of the Federal 
<line: 13> Rules of Civil Procedure because of Plaintiffs’ failure to obey the Court’s order regarding the initial 
<line: 14> case management conference and failure to prosecute.  See Order entered October 31, 2017 (Docket 
<line: 15> Entry No. 16).  Plaintiffs were specifically advised that their failure to show cause by that date would 
<line: 16> result in a recommendation to the District Judge that their case be dismissed.  Plaintiffs have not 
<line: 17> responded to the show cause order. 

[TEXT]
<line: 19> Rule 16(f)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that “on motion or on its own, 
<line: 20> the Court may issue any just orders, including those authorized by Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(ii)-(vii), if a 
<line: 21> party . . . (C) fails to obey a scheduling or other pretrial order.”  Pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(v), the 
<line: 22> Court may dismiss an action as a sanction.  In addition, it is well-settled that federal trial courts have 
<line: 23> the inherent power to manage their own dockets.  Link v. Wabash R.R., 370 U.S. 626, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 
<line: 24> 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1961).  Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure further permits the Court 
<line: 25> to dismiss an action upon a showing of a clear record of delay, contumacious conduct, or failure to 
<line: 26> prosecute by a plaintiff.  See Carter v. City of Memphis, Tennessee, 636 F.2d 159, 161 (6th Cir. 
<line: 27> 1980).

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Dismissal of this action pursuant to Rule 16(f)(1) and Rule 41(b) is warranted because of 
<line: 3> Plaintiffs’ failure to comply with the specific directives from the Court.  Plaintiffs ignored the 
<line: 4> Court’s directive to them to file a proposed case management order and to appear at the initial case 
<line: 5> management conference.  Further, Plaintiffs failed to respond in any manner to the show cause order 
<line: 6> issued by the Court subsequent to their failure to appear at the scheduled case management 
<line: 7> conference.  Dismissal with prejudice is appropriate in light of the impasse in further proceedings in 
<line: 8> the action caused by Plaintiffs’ failure to prosecute and their failure to respond to the specific 
<line: 9> directives of the Court.  Plaintiffs were specifically warned about the consequences of failing to 
<line: 10> respond to the show cause order.  The Court should not be required to expend any further resources 
<line: 11> in the action given Plaintiffs’ failure to prosecute, and a sanction lesser than dismissal is not 
<line: 12> warranted. 

[TITLE]
<line: 14> RECOMMENDATION 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Accordingly, the Court respectfully RECOMMENDS that this action be DISMISSED with 
<line: 17> prejudice in its entirety pursuant to Rule 16(f)(1) and Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
<line: 18> Procedure.1 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> ANY OBJECTIONS to this Report and Recommendation must be filed with the Clerk of 
<line: 21> Court within fourteen (14) days of service of this Report and Recommendation and must state 
<line: 22> with particularity the specific portions of this Report and Recommendation to which objection is 
<line: 23> made.  Failure to file written objections within the specified time can be deemed a waiver of the 
<line: 24> right to appeal the District Court’s Order regarding the Report and Recommendation.  See 

[ABANDON]
<line: 26> 1 The 14 day period for filing objections to this Report and Recommendation will give
