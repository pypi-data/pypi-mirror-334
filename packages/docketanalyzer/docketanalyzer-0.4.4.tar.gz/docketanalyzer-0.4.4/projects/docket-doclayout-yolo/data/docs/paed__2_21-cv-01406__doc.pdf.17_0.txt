<line: 18> MEMORANDUM OPINION 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Defendant Five Below, Inc. approached K7 
<line: 21> Design Group, Inc. and K7 Design Group, LLC (together, K7 or Plaintiff) to discuss a large 
<line: 22> order of hand sanitizer and soap.  Five Below maintains that the relationship was merely that—a 
<line: 23> preliminary discussion of a potential order that never materialized.  K7, on the other hand, 
<line: 24> alleges that Five Below placed an order to the tune of $2 million, which order Five Below 
<line: 25> repudiated upon realizing it had ordered far more hand sanitizer than it could sell.  Five Below 
<line: 26> moves to dismiss the contract claims brought by K7.  For the reasons that follow, the motion will 
<line: 27> be denied.  

[TITLE]
<line: 29> I. 
<line: 30> STANDARD OF REVIEW1 

[TEXT]
<line: 32> Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a complaint must be dismissed if it 
<line: 33> fails “to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. (12)(b)(6).  To survive a 
<line: 34> motion to dismiss, a complaint must “contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state 
<line: 35> a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) 

[ABANDON]
<line: 37> 1 There is jurisdiction over this dispute pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a) because Five Below is a citizen of 
<line: 38> Pennsylvania, K7 is a citizen of New York, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  In reviewing a complaint, 
<line: 3> courts must “accept all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most 
<line: 4> favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, 
<line: 5> the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.”  Blanyar v. Genova Prods. Inc., 861 F.3d 426, 431 (3d 
<line: 6> Cir. 2017) (internal quotations marks and citations omitted). 

[TITLE]
<line: 8> II. 
<line: 9> MATERIALS TO BE CONSIDERED 

[TEXT]
<line: 11> As a preliminary matter, Five Below argues that the Court should look beyond the 
<line: 12> Complaint to consider the complete chain of emails between the parties and Five Below’s 
<line: 13> Vendor Manual.  In ruling on a motion to dismiss, in addition to the allegations in the Complaint 
<line: 14> and exhibits attached thereto, “a court may consider an undisputedly authentic document that a 
<line: 15> defendant attaches as an exhibit to a motion to dismiss if the plaintiff’s claims are based on the 
<line: 16> document.”  Pension Ben. Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., Inc., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d 
<line: 17> Cir. 1993); see also In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 
<line: 18> 1997) (explaining that as “an exception to the general rule” that the court may consider only the 
<line: 19> pleadings, “a document integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint may be considered 
<line: 20> without converting the motion [to dismiss] into one for summary judgment.” (alteration in the 
<line: 21> original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). 

[TEXT]
<line: 23> The parties’ email correspondence, but not the Vendor manual, fall within the “narrowly 
<line: 24> defined types of material” that may be considered without converting a motion to dismiss to one 
<line: 25> for summary judgement.  In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc. Sec. Litig., 184 F.3d 280, 287 (3d 
<line: 26> Cir. 1999).  As K7 concedes, its breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims are explicitly 
<line: 27> based on the exchange of emails between K7 and Five Below, and that correspondence is 
<line: 28> integral to those claims.  The Complaint quotes extensively from the emails attached to the 

[ABANDON]
<line: 30> 2 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Motion to Dismiss, the authenticity of which are undisputed.  The Vendor Manual, on the other 
<line: 3> hand, is external to the allegations in the Complaint and will not be considered.  K7’s contract 
<line: 4> claims are not based on the Vendor Manual, which sets forth supplemental terms and conditions 
<line: 5> related to, inter alia, shipping, routing, packaging, testing, labeling, and insurance.  To the extent 
<line: 6> the Complaint refers to paperwork found in the Vendor Manual or actions taken in compliance 
<line: 7> with the Manual, such allegations are not, in the context of this motion to dismiss, integral to 
<line: 8> K7’s breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims.  In fact, it is undisputed that Five Below 
<line: 9> did not send K7 the Vendor Manual until after K7 alleges a contract was formed on or about 
<line: 10> May 14th.2 

[TITLE]
<line: 12> III. 
<line: 13> FACTS 

[TEXT]
<line: 15> The relevant facts are drawn from the Complaint and the email correspondence attached 
<line: 16> to Five Below’s motion to dismiss.  See In re Burlington, 114 F.3d at 1426.  Five Below is a 
<line: 17> national retailer of discount consumer goods, and K7 is family-owned manufacturer and 
<line: 18> distributor of consumer goods, including hand sanitizer and soap.  On April 24, 2020, Five 
<line: 19> Below solicited an initial proposal from K7 regarding the sale of hand sanitizer and soap 
<line: 20> products.  To that end, the parties discussed via email details such as timing, assortment of 
<line: 21> products, supply chain concerns, and price.  On May 11, 2020, Five Below responded 
<line: 22> enthusiastically to K7’s proposal and expressed an interest in moving forward with the order.  In 
<line: 23> the following days, K7 conveyed increasing urgency in nailing down the details as it was in the 
<line: 24> midst of allocating production capacity for the season.  On May 14, 2020, Five Below provided a 
<line: 25> breakdown by product style for an anticipated order of 600,000 travel size hand sanitizers but 

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 2 Consequently, Five Below’s invocation of the parole evidence rule based on the integration clause in the 
<line: 28> Vendor Manual and contention that the Vendor Manual requires the issuance of a Purchase Order as a 
<line: 29> condition precedent to a breach of contract claim will not be addressed herein.

<line: 31> 3 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> sought to further negotiate on price.  The same day, K7 responded that the quoted price was final 
<line: 3> and asked Five Below for “confirmation that we can go ahead and submit these in the production 
<line: 4> pipeline right away” and to “please confirm the costs are acceptable so we can begin and not risk 
<line: 5> losing our production.”  Five Below requested that K7 “please confirm based on the units . . . 
<line: 6> provided,” to which K7’s representative replied: “Yes this is confirmed and I will work with my 
<line: 7> team in getting these in the pipeline.” 

[TEXT]
<line: 9> The parties hammered out further details via email in the ensuing months.  K7 confirmed 
<line: 10> the order was in production, requested vendor related paperwork, and mailed product samples; 
<line: 11> Five Below proceeded to set-up K7 as a vendor, including sending K7 its Vendor Manual and 
<line: 12> issuing K7 a vendor number.  On September 17, 2020, K7 informed Five Below that the order 
<line: 13> was ready and requested shipping instructions.  However, on September 30, Five Below 
<line: 14> informed K7 that it could not accept the items.  Five Below thereafter repeatedly refused to 
<line: 15> accept the items, claiming that it did not issue a purchase order for them and that they did not 
<line: 16> pass Five Below’s testing protocols. 

[TITLE]
<line: 18> IV. 
<line: 19> ANALYSIS 

[TEXT]
<line: 21> Five Below moves to dismiss K7’s claims for breach of contract and promissory 
<line: 22> estoppel.3  Five Below argues that K7 fails to state a claim for breach of contract because there 
<line: 23> was no mutual manifestation of an intent to enter a binding agreement nor sufficiently definite 
<line: 24> terms to enforce.  Because the agreement as alleged is a contract for the sale and manufacture of 

[ABANDON]
<line: 26> 3 Five Below also asserts that, because K7 Design Group, LLC signed the Vendor Manual 
<line: 27> acknowledgement form, K7 Design Group, Inc. is not the real party in interest, lacks standing to sue, and 
<line: 28> should be dismissed from the case.  However, as explained infra, the Complaint adequately alleges that 
<line: 29> K7, Inc. entered a contract with Five Below via email for the sale of hand sanitizer products.  Moreover, 
<line: 30> that K7, LLC—described in the Complaint as a wholly owned subsidiary of K7, Inc.—signed a form on 
<line: 31> behalf of its parent company does not deprive K7, Inc. of its interest in the case.  See Freedom Props., 
<line: 32> L.P. v. Lansdale Warehouse Co. Inc., 2007 WL 1683850, at *4 (E.D. Pa. June 7, 2007) (explaining that 
<line: 33> under Pennsylvania law the principal is the party to a contract entered by an agent).

[TEXT]
<line: 2> goods, it is governed by Article 2 of the Pennsylvania Uniform Commercial Code, 13 Pa. Cons. 
<line: 3> Stat. § 2101 et seq.4  Section 2204 of the Pennsylvania UCC, governing the formation of 
<line: 4> contracts, provides that a “contract for sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to 
<line: 5> show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a 
<line: 6> contract.”  13 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 2204(a).  The Pennsylvania UCC has been interpreted 
<line: 7> consistently with the common law requirement of a mutual manifestation of an intent to be 
<line: 8> bound to form a contract.  See, e.g., ATACS Corp. v. Trans World Commc’ns, Inc., 155 F.3d 659, 
<line: 9> 665 (3d Cir. 1998) (“It is by now hornbook law that the test for enforceability of an agreement is 
<line: 10> whether both parties have manifested an intention to be bound” (internal quotation marks and 
<line: 11> citation omitted)); Reilly Foam Corp. v. Rubbermaid Corp., 206 F. Supp.2d 643, 650 (E.D. Pa. 
<line: 12> 2002) (explaining that an offer under the Pennsylvania UCC “has been defined based on 
<line: 13> common law principles as ‘the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made as to 
<line: 14> justify another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude 
<line: 15> it.’” (quoting Bergquist Co. v. Sunroc Corp., 777 F. Supp. 1236, 1248 (E.D. Pa. 1991))). 

[TEXT]
<line: 17> According to Five Below, the email exchange between the parties reveals only 
<line: 18> preliminary negotiations regarding the possible future sale of hand sanitizer.  See ATACS, 155 
<line: 19> F.3d at 666 (“[I]t is well established that evidence of preliminary negotiations or a general 
<line: 20> agreement to enter a binding contract in the future fail as enforceable contracts” (citing Goldman 
<line: 21> v. McShain, 247 A.2d 455, 458 (Pa. 1968))).  However, the Complaint plausibly alleges that Five 
<line: 22> Below placed and later repudiated a substantial order of hand sanitizer.  Because “[a]n agreement 
<line: 23> sufficient to constitute a contract for sale may be found even though the moment of its making is 

[ABANDON]
<line: 25> 4 The parties agree that Pennsylvania law applies.  Indeed, the choice of law provision in the Vendor 
<line: 26> Manual provides that “[t]he laws of the State of Pennsylvania, without regard to Pennsylvania’s choice of 
<line: 27> law principles, govern all matters arising out of or related to the Contract.”

<line: 2> undetermined,” K7 need not pinpoint the precise email that cemented the agreement.  13 Pa. 
<line: 3> Cons. Stat § 2204(b).  On K7’s reading, after negotiating the terms for weeks, K7 stressed the 
<line: 4> time sensitive nature of the deal asked Five Below for a firm confirmation.  Both parties 
<line: 5> thereafter confirmed the price and quantity quoted by K7.5  The parties’ subsequent conduct—
<line: 6> exchanging emails regarding the order, sending the Vendor Manual, issuing K7 a vendor 
<line: 7> number, K7 submitting vendor related paperwork and product samples—further supports K7’s 
<line: 8> position that a contract was formed.  See 13 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 2204(a); Standard Bent Glass 
<line: 9> Corp. v. Glassrobots Oy, 333 F.3d 440, 445 (3d Cir. 2003) (“In a commercial transaction 
<line: 10> involving the sale of goods [under the Pennsylvania UCC], where the parties’ performance 
<line: 11> demonstrates agreement, we look past disputes over contract formation and move directly to 
<line: 12> ascertain its terms.”). 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> Five Below also moves to dismiss K7’s promissory estoppel claim on the grounds that it 
<line: 15> was unreasonable for K7 to manufacture items based on Five Below’s ballpark projections.  
<line: 16> Under Pennsylvania law, a “promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce 
<line: 17> action or forbearance on the part of the promise . . . which does induce such action or 
<line: 18> forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.”  
<line: 19> Thatcher’s Drug Store of W. Goshen, Inc. v. Consol. Supermarkets, Inc., 636 A.2d 156, 160 (Pa. 
<line: 20> 1994) (quoting Restatement (Second) Contracts § 90(1)).  The Complaint alleges that K7 

[ABANDON]
<line: 22> 5 Five Below points to apparent contradictions in the Complaint regarding whether Five Below ordered 
<line: 23> soap as well as hand sanitizer and the total value of Five Below’s order as evidence that the agreement 
<line: 24> lacked sufficiently definite terms.  K7’s allegation that Five Below ordered 600,000 travel size hand 
<line: 25> sanitizers, divided into four sub-groups by product type, at the prices discussed and quoted via email, is 
<line: 26> sufficiently definite to be enforced.  See 13 Pa. Cons. Stat § 2204(c) (“Even though one or more terms are 
<line: 27> left open a contract for sale does not fail for indefiniteness if the parties have intended to make a contract 
<line: 28> and there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy.”); see also Reilly, 206 F. Supp.2d 
<line: 29> at 651 (explaining that pursuant to the Pennsylvania UCC “contract formation depends on the 
<line: 30> manifestation of intent by the parties to be bound rather than the presence or absence of specific terms”).

<line: 2> manufactured 600,000 units of hand sanitizer specifically for Five Below in reliance on Five 
<line: 3> Below’s purchase commitment and subsequent assurances.  Whether K7’s reliance on the 
<line: 4> parties’ email exchange in manufacturing the hand sanitizer for Five Below was reasonable is a 
<line: 5> question of fact for the jury.  See Toy v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 928 A.2d 186, 208 (Pa. 2007) 
<line: 6> (“[J]ustifiable reliance is typically a question of fact for the fact-finder to decide, and requires a 
<line: 7> consideration of the parties, their relationship, and the circumstances surrounding their 
<line: 8> transaction.”).
