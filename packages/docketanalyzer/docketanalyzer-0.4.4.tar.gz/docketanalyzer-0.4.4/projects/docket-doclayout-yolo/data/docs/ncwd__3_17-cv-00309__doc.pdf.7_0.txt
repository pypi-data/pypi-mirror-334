<line: 26> THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 3) filed
<line: 27> pursuant to 12(b)(2), 12(b)(4), and 12(b)(5) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Court
<line: 28> issued an order, in accordance with Roseboro v. Garrison, 528 F.2d 309 (4th Cir. 1975), informing.
<line: 29> Plaintiff or her right to respond and the burden she carried in responding to Defendant's motion to
<line: 30> dismiss.' (Doc. No. 4). Plaintiff responded, and Defendant replied (Doc. No. 6). This matter is.
<line: 31> now ripe for ruling. For the reasons that follow, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED

[TITLE]
<line: 33> BACKGROUND

[TEXT]
<line: 35> Plaintiff initiated this action by filing a complaint on May 5, 2017, against Defendant.
<line: 36> "Wells Fargo Bank"' in state court, specifically in the General Court of Justice, District Court

[ABANDON]
<line: 38> 1 The Fourth Circuit did not hold in Roseboro that such notice is required for motions to dismiss. Rather, the Fourth
<line: 39> Circuit's discussion in Roseboro regarding notice was directed to summary judgment motions. See Roseboro v.
<line: 40> Garrison, 528 F.2d 309, 310 (4th Cir. 1975) (*We agree with the plaintiff, however, that there is another side to the
<line: 41> coin which requires that the plaintiff be advised of his right to file counter-affidavits or other responsive material and
<line: 42> alerted to the fact that his failure to so respond might result in the entry of summary judgment against him."); see also
<line: 43> Norman v. Taylor, 25 F.3d 1259, 1261 (4th Cir. 1994) (*In Roseboro v. Garrison, 528 F.2d 309 (4th Cir. 1975), this
<line: 44> circuit held that pro se plaintiffs must be advised that their failure to file responsive material when a defendant moves
<line: 45> for summary judgment may well result in entry of summary judgment against them."). Nevertheless, courts routinely
<line: 46> issue Roseboro notices for motions to dismiss, and the Court did so here..

<line: 2> Division, County of Mecklenburg.  (Doc. No. 1-2).  Plaintiff had Civil Summons in this action 
<line: 3> issued to “Wells Fargo Bank, 8740 Research Dr., Charlotte NC 28262.”  (Doc. No. 1-2, p. 2).  The 
<line: 4> record indicates Plaintiff attempted to serve a copy of her initial pleadings via Certified Mail, by 
<line: 5> mailing the documents to “Wells Fargo Bank, 8740 Research Dr., Charlotte NC 28262.”  (Doc. 
<line: 6> No. 1-2, p. 6).  The record also indicates the Summons and Complaint made their way to 
<line: 7> Defendant’s legal department via “Interoffice Delivery” several weeks after Plaintiff had filed her 
<line: 8> complaint.  (Doc. No. 1-2, p. 7).  Defendant subsequently removed this action from state court to 
<line: 9> this Court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.  (Doc. No. 1).  Defendant now moves to 
<line: 10> dismiss based on deficient service of process. 

[TITLE]
<line: 12> STANDARD OF REVIEW 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> Defendant argues the Court should dismiss the complaint because of insufficient process 
<line: 15> pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(4) and insufficient service of process pursuant 
<line: 16> to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(5), and, consequently, lack of personal jurisdiction under 
<line: 17> Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2).  Under these rules, “the plaintiff bears the burden of 
<line: 18> establishing that the service of process has been performed in accordance with the requirements of 
<line: 19> Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4.”  Elkins v. Broome, 213 F.R.D. 273, 275 (M.D.N.C. 2003).  

[TEXT]
<line: 21> Service of process in this case is controlled by North Carolina law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(e) 
<line: 22> (“[A]n individual ... may be served in a judicial district of the United States by: (1) following state 
<line: 23> law for serving a summons in an action brought in courts of general jurisdiction in the state where 
<line: 24> the district court is located or where service is made....”); Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(h) (applying Fed.R.Civ.P. 
<line: 25> 4(e)(1) to service on corporate defendants).   Service on corporate defendants may be effectuated 

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 2 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> by sending the summons and complaint by certified mail addressed to “the officer, director or 
<line: 3> agent to be served.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1; N.C. R. Civ. P. 4(j)(6)(c).   

[TEXT]
<line: 5> The proper methods of service on corporations are to either (1) “deliver a copy of 
<line: 6> the summons and of the complaint to an officer, a managing or general agent, or to 
<line: 7> any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process,” 
<line: 8> or (2) follow the state law rules for effecting service. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(h)(1). The 
<line: 9> North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provide that corporations should be served 
<line: 10> by delivering or mailing a copy of the summons and of the complaint to either “an 
<line: 11> officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation,” someone who appears to 
<line: 12> be in charge of that person's office, or to the person authorized to accept service for 
<line: 13> the corporation.  N.C. R. Civ. P. 4(j)(6).

[TEXT]
<line: 17> Where service of process has given the defendant actual notice of the litigation, “the rules, 
<line: 18> in general are entitled to a liberal construction. When there is actual notice, every technical 
<line: 19> violation of the rule or failure of strict compliance may not invalidate the service of process.” 
<line: 20> Armco, Inc. v. Penrod-Stauffer Bldg. Sys., Inc., 733 F.2d 1087, 1089 (4th Cir. 1984); see also 
<line: 21> Karlsson v. Rabinowitz, 318 F.2d 666, 668 (4th Cir. 2011) (“The provisions of [Rule 4] should be 
<line: 22> liberally construed to effectuate service and uphold the jurisdiction of the court, thus insuring the 
<line: 23> opportunity for a trial on the merits.”).   

[TEXT]
<line: 25> This, however, does not give the Court license to ignore the plain requirements for the 
<line: 26> means of effecting service of process contained in the rules. See id. Under North Carolina law, “a 
<line: 27> plaintiff who fails to comply with [service of process statutes], even where actual notice occurs, 
<line: 28> does not properly serve the defendant.”  Shaver v. Cooleemee Volunteer Fire Dep’t., No. 1:07-cv-
<line: 29> 175, 2008 WL 942560, at *2 (M.D.N.C. 2008) (citing Stack v. Union Reg’l Mem'l Med. Ctr., Inc., 
<line: 30> 614 S.E.2d 378, 382 (N.C. Ct. App. 2005); Greenup v. Register, 410 S.E.2d 398, 400 (N.C. Ct.

<line: 2> App. 1991); Broughton v. Dumont, 259 S.E.2d 361, 363 (N.C. Ct. App. 1979). Although Plaintiff
<line: 3> is proceeding pro se, she is held to the same standards regarding service of process:

[TEXT]
<line: 5> The filing of a lawsuit is a serious event.... Service rules are structured to ensure
<line: 6> due process and uniformity in the application of procedures which alert those
<line: 7> receiving a corporation's mail that the enclosed lawsuit demands prompt attention.
<line: 8> These rules apply equally to litigants proceeding with or without counsel. Service
<line: 9> of process is not freestyle, and courts are directed not to overlook procedural
<line: 10> deficiencies just because actual notice occurred..

[TEXT]
<line: 14> United Auto Workers Local Union 5285, 444 F.Supp.2d 467, 474 (W.D.N.C. 2006)). The

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Supreme Court has explained the Rules of Civil Procedure apply to all parties before the Court,

[TEXT]
<line: 18> including pro se litigants in civil cases:.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Our rules of procedure are based on the assumption that litigation is normally
<line: 21> conducted by lawyers. While we have insisted that the pleadings prepared by
<line: 22> prisoners who do not have access to counsel be liberally construed, see Haines v.
<line: 23> Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); Estelle v. Gamble, 429
<line: 24> U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 292, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), and have held that some
<line: 25> procedural rules must give way because of the unique circumstance of
<line: 26> incarceration, see Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245
<line: 27> (1988) (pro se prisoner's notice of appeal deemed filed at time of delivery to prison
<line: 28> authorities), we have never suggested that procedural rules in ordinary civil
<line: 29> litigation should be interpreted so as to excuse mistakes by those who proceed
<line: 30> without counsel. As we have noted before, "in the long run, experience teaches that
<line: 31> strict adherence to the procedural requirements specified by the legislature is the
<line: 32> best guarantee of evenhanded administration of the law." Mohasco Corp. v. Silver.
<line: 33> 447 U.S. 807, 826, 100 S.Ct. 2486, 2497, 65 L.Ed.2d 532 (1980).

<line: 36> (emphasis added). Bearing these principles in mind, the Court turns to the merits of Defendant's
<line: 37> arguments.

[TITLE]
<line: 2> ANALYSIS 

[TEXT]
<line: 4> Here, Defendant argues personal jurisdiction is lacking because Plaintiff failed to properly 
<line: 5> serve Defendant.  The burden to prove that process has been executed in accordance with Rule 4 
<line: 6> of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is on Plaintiff.  Plant Genetic Systems v. Ciba Seeds, 933 
<line: 7> F.Supp. 519, 526 (M.D.N.C. 1996).   

[TEXT]
<line: 9> The uncontested record shows Plaintiff neither addressed the Summons and Complaint to 
<line: 10> nor attempted to serve process upon an appropriate officer, director, managing agent, or authorized 
<line: 11> agent of Defendant Wells Fargo Bank.  Indeed, Plaintiff failed to designate any individual in the 
<line: 12> summons to be served on Defendant’s behalf.  Summons issued to a corporation without the 
<line: 13> identification of an officer, director, or managing or authorized agent is defective on its face.  Lane 
<line: 14> v. Winn-Dixie Charlotte, Inc., 609 S.E.2d 456, 460 (N.C. Ct. App. 2005) (“A review of the 
<line: 15> summons demonstrates that plaintiffs failed to designate any person authorized by Rule 4(j)(6) to 
<line: 16> be served on behalf of the corporate defendant in violation of the clear requirements of the rule. 
<line: 17> Accordingly, the summons was defective on its face.”).   

[TEXT]
<line: 19> Similarly, without directing that service be made on a specific person, Plaintiff’s purported 
<line: 20> service on “Wells Fargo Bank” fails to comply with the service requirements of Rule 4(j) of the 
<line: 21> Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Moreover, although Rule 4(j) also permits service “in the 
<line: 22> manner prescribed by [North Carolina] law for serving a summons or other like process upon any 
<line: 23> such defendant,” Plaintiff did not comply with the applicable North Carolina law for the same 
<line: 24> reasons.  See N.C. R. Civ. P. 4(j)(6). 

[TEXT]
<line: 26> In light of the insufficient process and insufficient service of process, this Court never 
<line: 27> obtained personal jurisdiction over Defendant.  See, Mabee v. Onslow Cnty. Sheriff's Dep't, 620 

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> 5 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> S.E.2d 307, 308 (N.C. Ct. App. 2005) (affirming dismissal of complaint because "This Court has
<line: 3> unequivocally stated that when a statute prescribes the manner for proper notification, the
<line: 4> summons must be issued and served in that manner. The requirements regarding adequate service
<line: 5> of process must be construed strictly and the prescribed procedure must be followed strictly such
<line: 6> that if the necessary procedures are not adhered to there is no valid service. Finally, although
<line: 7> defective service may be sufficient to give the party actual notification of the proceedings, such
<line: 8> actual notice does not give the court jurisdiction over the party. (quotations and citations omitted)),
<line: 9> disc. rev. denied, 629 S.E.2d 854 (N.C. 2006).

[TEXT]
<line: 11> For the reasons above, the Court grants the motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to
<line: 12> Rule 12(b)(2), 12(b)(4), and 12(b)(5) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Faircloth v.
<line: 13> Sampson Cty. Sch., No. 7:10-CV-29-D, 2010 WL 5173601, at *1-2 (E.D.N.C. Dec. 10, 2010)
<line: 14> (dismissing complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), 12(b)(4), and 12(b)(5))

[TITLE]
<line: 16> CONCLUSION

[TEXT]
<line: 18> This court is mindful of the requirement that pro se filings "however unskillfully pleaded,.
<line: 19> must be liberally construed." Noble v. Barnett, 24 F.3d 582, 587 n. 6 (4th Cir. 1994). Nonetheless,
<line: 20> Plaintiff has offered the court no explanation for the deficiencies raised by Defendant; nor has
<line: 21> Plaintiff requested additional time to cure the defects noted herein..

[TEXT]
<line: 23> IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 3) is
<line: 24> GRANTED, and this matter shall be dismissed without prejudice..
