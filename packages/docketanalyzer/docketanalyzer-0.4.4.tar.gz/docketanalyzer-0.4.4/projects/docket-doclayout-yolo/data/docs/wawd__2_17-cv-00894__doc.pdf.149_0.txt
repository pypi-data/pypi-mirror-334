<line: 30> Validity and Ownership of EKOBREW Marks 

[TEXT]
<line: 32> 13. 
<line: 33> To be valid and protectable, a trademark must be either:  (i) inherently 
<line: 34> distinctive; or (ii) descriptive with an acquired secondary meaning.  See 9th Cir. Model 
<line: 35> Instr. Nos. 15.10 & 15.11; Court’s Instruction No. 14B. 

[TEXT]
<line: 37> 14. 
<line: 38> Eko Brands contends that EKOBREW is a “suggestive” trademark and 
<line: 39> therefore inherently distinctive.  Defendants assert that EKOBREW is merely a 
<line: 40> “descriptive” trademark that has not acquired any secondary meaning and, as a result, is 
<line: 41> not valid or protectable.  The advisory jury was asked whether the EKOBREW mark is 
<line: 42> “suggestive” or “descriptive,” but it could not reach a unanimous verdict.  See Verdict 
<line: 43> (docket no. 136).  The advisory jury, however, found that the EKOBREW mark had 
<line: 44> acquired secondary meaning before defendants first began to use ECO FILL.  Id.

[TEXT]
<line: 43> The presence or absence of any particular factor does not necessarily resolve whether a 
<line: 44> trademark has acquired secondary meaning.  A trademark does not need to be used for 
<line: 45> any particular length of time to acquire a secondary meaning.  See 9th Cir. Model Instr. 
<line: 46> No. 15.11; Court’s Instruction No. 14B.

<line: 49> Regardless of whether the EKOBREW Marks are “suggestive” or

<line: 26> 18. 
<line: 27> When EKOBREW reusable filters debuted in September 2011, they were 
<line: 28> the #1 new release in the Amazon.com grocery category.  In the spring of 2012, the 
<line: 29> EKOBREW cartridge was among the five finalists for a Housewares Design Award.  By 
<line: 30> the end of 2012, Eko Brands had sold 262,994 cases of EKOBREW filters (12 per case), 
<line: 31> generating just over $9.5 million in gross revenue.  See Ex. 123 at EKOTM0254453; see 
<line: 32> also Tr. (Sep. 18, 2019) at 355:10-356:12 (docket no. 140). 
<line: 33> 19. 
<line: 34> As of April 2013, Eko Brands used for its EKOBREW cartridges both 
<line: 35> cylindrical and rectangular packaging, with clear portions through which the product can 
<line: 36> be viewed.  In late 2013 and early 2014, Eko Brands began extending its use of the 
<line: 37> EKOBREW Marks to other items, namely paper filters and cleaning tablets.  As of 
<line: 38> April 2014, the top distributors or retailers of the EKOBREW “flagship” product were 
<line: 39> Ahold, Amazon, Bed Bath & Beyond, KeHe Distributors, Safeway, and Walmart.  By 
<line: 40> the time Eko Brands was acquired in 2015 by Espresso Supply, Inc., approximately 
<line: 41> 10 million EKOBREW filters had been sold.  In March 2016, Eko Brands introduced an 
<line: 42> EKOBREW “carafe” reusable filter for multi-cup brewing in the Keurig® 2.0 machine. 
<line: 43> 20. 
<line: 44> Eko Brands has several competitors in the reusable cartridge market, 
<line: 45> including Keurig’s MY K-CUP, Solofill, Melitta’s JAVA JIG, and CAFÉ CUP.  ARM is 
<line: 46> the only company other than Eko Brands to use the EKO or ECO prefix in a trademark 
<line: 47> associated with filters for Keurig® and similar brewing machines. 
<line: 48> 21. 
<line: 49> As of September 2012, when defendants began using ECO FILL, the 
<line: 50> EKOBREW Marks were linked with the industry leader at the time, i.e., Eko Brands.  
<line: 51> By then, the EKOBREW reusable filters had already gained recognition from the largest

<line: 26> e-commerce company in the United States (Amazon) and the trade publication 
<line: 27> (HomeWorld Business) that sponsors the annual Housewares Design Awards.  Eko 
<line: 28> Brands had devoted substantial resources to advertising under the EKOBREW Marks, 
<line: 29> developing a website with the same name (www.ekobrew.com), attending trade shows, 
<line: 30> and participating in social media.  Before defendants started branding with ECO FILL, 
<line: 31> the EKOBREW Marks had demonstrated their utility, being linked to a product that 
<line: 32> almost doubled in sales from 2011 to 2012.  During this same timeframe, no competitor 
<line: 33> used a similar mark.  The Court therefore ADOPTS the advisory jury’s verdict that the 
<line: 34> EKOBREW Marks acquired secondary meaning before defendants first began to use 
<line: 35> ECO FILL. 

[TEXT]
<line: 37> 22. 
<line: 38> Although a close call, as indicated by the advisory jury’s inability to reach a 
<line: 39> verdict, the EKOBREW Marks are suggestive and therefore inherently distinctive.  
<line: 40> Whether a trademark is “suggestive” or “descriptive” must be determined with reference 
<line: 41> to the goods that the trademark identifies.  A trademark, however, need not recite in detail 
<line: 42> each feature of the related goods to qualify as merely descriptive.  To be descriptive, a 
<line: 43> trademark only has to describe some aspect of the product.  Two tests apply when 
<line: 44> determining whether a trademark is “suggestive” or “descriptive,” namely (i) the 
<line: 45> “imagination” test; and (ii) the “needs” test.  The “imagination” test asks whether a

<line: 2> If a mental leap is not required, then the trademark is descriptive.  The “needs” test 
<line: 3> focuses on the extent to which a trademark (or one of its components) is needed by 
<line: 4> competitors to identify their goods.  If competitors have a great need to use the 
<line: 5> trademark, then the trademark is more likely to be descriptive.  On the other hand, if the 
<line: 6> relationship between the trademark and the product is so remote and subtle that the 
<line: 7> trademark is not really needed by competitors to describe their goods, then the trademark 
<line: 8> is more likely to be suggestive.  See 9th Cir. Model Instr. Nos. 15.10 & 15.11; Court’s

<line: 18> When asked about ARM’s competing ECO FILL trademark, Rivera 
<line: 19> testified that he believed the mark was distinctive and entitled to protection, and he

<line: 21> at 223:22 (docket no. 139).  Rivera’s view is that EKOBREW and ECO FILL are both

<line: 25> 5 Although Eko Brands was originally unsuccessful in securing registration of the EKOBREW

<line: 28> Roasting, Inc. of Spokane, Washington, and used in connection with coffee beans.  Eko Brands

<line: 27> Both the PTO’s decision to permit registration of the EKOBREW Marks 
<line: 28> and Rivera’s concession on the subject support a finding that the EKOBREW Marks are 
<line: 29> valid.  Moreover, both the “imagination” test and the “needs” test lead to the conclusion 
<line: 30> that the EKOBREW Marks are “suggestive,” rather than merely “descriptive.”  Although 
<line: 31> the term ECO, or its phonetic equivalent EKO,6 in combination with BREW, connotes an 
<line: 32> ecological or environmentally-friendly brewing solution, it does not itself describe the 
<line: 33> approach embodied in the EKOBREW products.  Rather, a “mental leap” is required to 
<line: 34> understand that the device referenced by the EKOBREW Marks is a reusable filter or 
<line: 35> cartridge for a single-serving beverage brewing machine.  This conclusion is reinforced 
<line: 36> by the absence of competitors other than ARM that use ECO or EKO, or BREW, as part 
<line: 37> of their brand names.  The lack of “need” demonstrated by this evidence tends to show 
<line: 38> that EKOBREW is “suggestive,” rather than “descriptive.”  The Court’s finding that 
<line: 39> EKOBREW is “suggestive” and therefore inherently distinctive constitutes an alternative 
<line: 40> basis for concluding that the EKOBREW Marks are valid and protectable. 

[TEXT]
<line: 42> 6 Eko Brands contends that EKO is a fanciful or coined word entitled to be treated as “arbitrary” 
<line: 43> for the purpose of determining its inherent distinctiveness.  Such argument runs contrary to the 
<line: 44> weight of authorities.  See Armstrong Paint & Varnish Works v. Nu-Enamel Corp., 305 U.S. 315, 
<line: 45> 328 (1938) (observing that “the mark ‘Nu-Enamel’ is descriptive of a type of paint long familiar 
<line: 46> to manufacturers, with the addition of the adjective new, phonetically spelled or misspelled”); 
<line: 47> Unisplay S.A. v. Am. Elec. Sign Co., 28 U.S.P.Q.2d 1721 (E.D. Wash. 1993) (concluding that 
<line: 48> “Solar Glo,” which incorporated an incomplete form of “glow,” was descriptive and had no 
<line: 49> secondary meaning); In re Calphalon Corp., 122 U.S.P.Q.2d 1153 (T.T.A.B. 2017) (affirming 
<line: 50> the refusal to register SHARPIN, as being equivalent to “sharpen,” which was merely descriptive 
<line: 51> in connection with cutlery blocks containing built-in blade sharpeners).

<line: 27> Regardless of whether the EKOBREW Marks are “suggestive” or 
<line: 28> “descriptive,” Eko Brands owned the EKOBREW Marks before defendants first began to 
<line: 29> use ECO FILL.  If the EKOBREW Marks are “suggestive,” then Eko Brands has the 
<line: 30> burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that it used the EKOBREW 
<line: 31> Marks for its products before defendants began to use ECO FILL to market their products 
<line: 32> in the area where Eko Brands sells its product.  On the other hand, if the EKOBREW 
<line: 33> Marks are “descriptive,” then Eko Brands has the burden of showing by a preponderance

<line: 43> 27. 
<line: 44> Defendants’ use of their “ECO” trademarks is likely to cause confusion 
<line: 45> about the source of Eko Brands’ and/or ARM’s goods.  In connection with its first claim 
<line: 46> of trademark infringement occurring on or after November 1, 2016, Eko Brands 
<line: 47> challenges the following ARM trademarks:  ECO FILL, ECO CARAFE, ECO-FLOW, 
<line: 48> ECO FILTER, ECOSAVE, and ECO-PURE.  With respect to its second claim of unfair 
<line: 49> competition occurring before November 1, 2016, Eko Brands contends that the following 
<line: 50> ARM trademarks were infringing:  ECO FILL, ECO CARAFE, and ECO-FLOW.

<line: 52> ARM first generated revenue in November 2012 from use of the ECO FILL

<line: 47> applied the non-exhaustive Sleekcraft factors, which are as follows:  (1) strength or 
<line: 48> weakness of the marks; (2) proximity of the goods; (3) similarity of the marks; (4) actual 
<line: 49> confusion; (5) marketing channels used; (6) consumer’s degree of care; (7) defendants’ 
<line: 50> intent; and (8) likelihood of product line expansion.  The Court has been mindful that the 
<line: 51> presence or absence of any particular factor does not necessarily resolve the question of

<line: 2> whether confusion is likely. See 9th Cir. Model Instr. No. 15.18; Court's Instruction

<line: 4> 31.
<line: 5>  Although the marks at issue are fairly weak,' a finding of infringement is
<line: 6> nevertheless supported by the proximity of the goods with which they are associated (i.e.,
<line: 7> 5  direct competitors), the similarity of the marks (containing an aurally-identical prefix),
<line: 8>  and the overlap in marketing channels within which the products are advertised and travel
<line: 9> (namely, e-commerce and certain brick-and-mortar retailers). See Sleekcraft, 599 F.2d at
<line: 10>  350 (observing that "[a]lthough appellant's mark is protectible and may have been.
<line: 11> 9  strengthened by advertising, it is a weak mark entitled to a restricted range of protection"
<line: 12> 10  and "only if the marks are quite similar, and the goods closely related, will infringement
<line: 13> be found' (citations omitted)). In addition, the inexpensive nature of the products and the

<line: 16> ARM's efforts to expand the use of their respective marks to complementary products,

<line: 32> was sometime in April 2011.  Tr. (Sep. 18, 2019) at 418:20-419:1 (docket no. 140).  This 
<line: 33> statement is inconsistent with the decision to pay a designer $5,800 to work exclusively 
<line: 34> on a logo and packaging for an entirely different mark, i.e., EZ-FILL.  See Ex. 98.  The

<line: 39> Rivera testified that he did not know about Eko Brands or EKOBREW in

<line: 41> 184:11-185:15 (docket no. 139).  Having observed Rivera’s demeanor during trial and 
<line: 42> considered the other evidence in the record, the Court finds that Rivera’s denial of 
<line: 43> knowledge is not credible.  The evidence establishes that, before EKOBREW’s launch in 
<line: 44> September 2011, defendants intended to simply extend their “EZ” line by calling their

<line: 4> 39. 
<line: 5> In response to questioning by Eko Brands’ counsel, Rivera acknowledged 
<line: 6> at trial that he keeps his eyes on the competition by monitoring Amazon and other 
<line: 7> marketplaces, but he speculated that he did not become aware of EKOBREW until late 
<line: 8> 2012 or “maybe 2013.”  Tr. (Sep. 17, 2019) at 181:5-184:4, 184:20-21 (docket no. 139).  
<line: 9> EKOBREW’s status as a #1 new release on Amazon in September 2011 could not have 
<line: 10> escaped Rivera’s and/or Ditta’s notice for long, and certainly not for a year or more, as 
<line: 11> Rivera suggests.  Moreover, Rivera’s estimate of learning about EKOBREW in late 2012 
<line: 12> or 2013 is contradicted by Ditta’s testimony that, in January 2012, a manufacturer with 
<line: 13> whom he was working on a different product told him about EKOBREW.  Tr. (Sep. 18, 
<line: 14> 2019) at 419:12-420:10 (docket no. 140).  Even if they were not aware of EKOBREW 
<line: 15> before seeking registration of ECO FILL, defendants knew about the competing mark 
<line: 16> several months before they introduced their similarly-named product into the market. 
<line: 17> 40. 
<line: 18> The haste with which Rivera applied to register ECO FILL also undermines 
<line: 19> his assertion that he was unaware of EKOBREW at the time.  Defendants could have 
<line: 20> ascertained from the PTO’s records that Eko Brands had been unsuccessful in its initial 
<line: 21> attempt to register EKOBREW, and the relative speed with which an application for 
<line: 22> ECO FILL was filed (less than two weeks after the ECO FILL logo was developed 
<line: 23> versus 6-to-10 years after using PERFECT POD in commerce) constitutes evidence of 
<line: 24> defendants’ desire to beat Eko Brands to the proverbial punch.  These facts demonstrate

<line: 41> In Eko Brands, LLC v. Adrian Rivera Maynez Enterprises, Inc., et al., 
<line: 42> W.D. Wash. Case No. C15-522 JPD, a jury awarded damages to Eko Brands and against 
<line: 43> ARM and Rivera in the amount of $192,801.00 for non-willful infringement of United 
<line: 44> States Patent No. 8,707,855 (the “’855 Patent”).  See Verdict (C15-522, docket no. 242).

<line: 23> June 8, 2018.  See Instr. Nos. 36-38 (C15-522, docket no. 233). 
<line: 24> 47. 
<line: 25> During his opening statement in the patent trial, counsel for Eko Brands 
<line: 26> told the jury that the claim for infringement of the ’855 Patent “covers the entirety of this 
<line: 27> unit,” meaning ARM’s ECO FILL and/or ECO-FLOW capsule, and that Eko Brands is 
<line: 28> “entitled to the royalty based on that unit.”  Tr. (June 4, 2018) at 65:19-22 (C15-522, 
<line: 29> docket no. 326).  According to Eko Brands’ attorney, the features of ARM’s product 
<line: 30> could not be apportioned so as to reduce the royalty rate, and the unit was “not divisible 
<line: 31> in any other way.”  Id. at 65:15-23.  In his opening statement in the trademark matter, the 
<line: 32> same lawyer for Eko Brands explained disgorgement as follows:  “Remember that graph, 
<line: 33> the inverse relationship as Eko’s profits went down . . . , defendants’ went up.  And it’s 
<line: 34> that delta there, or the disgorgement of profits that trademark law allows [Eko Brands] to 
<line: 35> recover.”  Tr. (Sep. 16, 2019) at 21:22-22:1 (docket no. 138).11   
<line: 36> 48. 
<line: 37> To the extent Eko Brands alleges that defendants’ profit in connection with 
<line: 38> the ECO FILL and ECO-FLOW products was attributable exclusively to trademark 
<line: 39> infringement, such theory runs contrary to the premise on which the jury in the patent 
<line: 40> case awarded damages, i.e., that defendants profited from infringing the ’855 Patent 
<line: 41> without paying a reasonable royalty.  The patent royalty owed by defendants, which 
<line: 42> constitutes an item of expense to be deducted from gross revenue to compute net profit, 

[ABANDON]
<line: 44> 11 To the extent Eko Brands contends that it is entitled to both its losses (decline in profit), as 
<line: 45> well as defendants’ profit, such assertion is inconsistent with Eko Brands’ withdrawal of its 
<line: 46> claim for actual damages.  See Pla.’s Resp. (docket no. 120).

<line: 3> not be permitted in equity to argue that, for purposes of disgorgement under the Lanham 
<line: 4> Act, branding is all that matters when, in the patent context, it took the position that the 
<line: 5> various product features, including the labeling, were not divisible.  The Court therefore 
<line: 6> concludes that Eko Brands is not entitled, in connection with either claim in this action, 
<line: 7> to disgorgement of defendants’ profit associated with products bearing the marks ECO 
<line: 8> FILL DELUXE, ECO FILL DELUXE 2.0, or ECO-FLOW during the period from

<line: 37> 53. 
<line: 38> With regard to defendants’ profit for the period from August 1, 2019, to the 
<line: 39> present, Eko Brands did not satisfy its burden of proving gross revenue.  The amount 
<line: 40> sought for the approximately six-week period before trial and thereafter (i.e., $57,092.00 
<line: 41> per month) is entirely speculative, extrapolated from variable monthly profit figures for 
<line: 42> the preceding years without any expert (or even lay) testimony to support such analysis.  
<line: 43> Eko Brands is not entitled to disgorgement of defendants’ profit on or after August 1, 
<line: 44> 2019.

<line: 46> 13 Defendants offered a similar explanation concerning ARM’s ECO CARAFE filter, indicating 
<line: 47> that Eko Brands’ similar carafe-sized product also had compatibility issues with the Keurig® 2.0 
<line: 48> machine, but in contrast to the testimony concerning the ECO FILL 2.0 device, defendants did 
<line: 49> not provide evidence concerning the timing of the changes Keurig made to the security system, 
<line: 50> which necessitated a redesign of the carafe cartridge, or the monthly sales before and after ARM 
<line: 51> rolled out its solution.  As a result, the Court cannot draw the same conclusion with respect to 
<line: 52> ECO CARAFE as it has in connection with ECO FILL 2.0, and instead concludes that 
<line: 53> defendants have not met their burden of proving that any portion of the profit derived from use 
<line: 54> of the mark ECO CARAFE is attributable to the ARM product’s superior compatibility with 
<line: 55> Keurig’s 2.0 device.

<line: 27> Expenses

<line: 29> 54. 
<line: 30> In attempting to meet their burden of proving expenses, defendants relied 
<line: 31> on financial summaries provided in a spreadsheet format.  See Exs. 89 & 274.  The 
<line: 32> spreadsheets itemized expenses on a yearly basis, and they divided the annual overhead 
<line: 33> between the “ECO” part and the remainder of ARM’s business.  Defendants have 
<line: 34> proffered sufficient evidence to support the expenses that must be deducted from gross 
<line: 35> revenue in calculating the profit to be disgorged. 

[TEXT]
<line: 37> 55. 
<line: 38> Given the need to apportion the profit between Eko Brands’ two claims, 
<line: 39> which involve different sets of infringing marks and distinct time frames, the Court has 
<line: 40> used the data set forth in Exhibit 274, which is duplicated in Exhibit 89, to allocate 
<line: 41> “ECO” related expenses pro rata among the various marks.  The pro rata computation 
<line: 42> was performed on the basis of gross profit (gross revenue minus cost of goods).  For 
<line: 43> example, in 2014, the gross profit generated by ECO FILL 1.0 ($148,777 + $280,446) 
<line: 44> and ECO FILL MAX ($10,317) capsules was $439,540.  This figure represents roughly 
<line: 45> 52% of the gross profit for all “ECO” products ($841,628), and thus, 52% of the “ECO” 
<line: 46> related expenses (or $233,634 of the total $447,360) was deducted to arrive at a net profit 
<line: 47> figure of $205,906 for ECO FILL 1.0 and ECO FILL MAX products combined (referred 
<line: 48> to in Tables 1 and 2, infra ¶¶ 59 & 60, as simply “ECO FILL 1.0”).  This analysis was 
<line: 49> performed for each brand and year at issue.

<line: 26> 60. 
<line: 27> As for Eko Brands’ second claim alleging unfair competition, further 
<line: 28> discussion is warranted concerning the profit associated with defendants’ use of the mark 
<line: 29> ECO CARAFE.  Although Eko Brands’ co-owner Laura Sommers approximated that, 
<line: 30> in 2015, Eko Brands began selling carafe-size filters under the EKOBREW Marks, she 
<line: 31> admitted during cross-examination that she did not know which company, ARM or 
<line: 32> Eko Brands, was the first to launch a carafe product.  See Tr. (Sep. 16, 2019) at 66:13-15 
<line: 33> (docket no. 138);  Tr. (Sep. 17, 2019) at 163:11-16 (docket no. 139).  Other evidence, 
<line: 34> including facts stipulated by the parties, indicates that ARM entered the carafe market in 
<line: 35> early February 2015, while Eko Brands trailed far behind and did not introduce a carafe 
<line: 36> device until March 2016.  During the interim, defendants generated a profit of $822,290 
<line: 37> on sales of ECO CARAFE filters.17  For three consecutive years beginning in 2016, when 
<line: 38> Eko Brands began offering a carafe filter carrying the EKOBREW Marks, defendants 
<line: 39> experienced net losses.  The Court finds that the profit associated with use of the mark 
<line: 40> ECO CARAFE during the time frame of Claim 2 is attributable to a factor other than 
<line: 41> unfair competition, namely the absence of any competing EKOBREW carafe-size 
<line: 42> product.  In light of this and other rulings, the Court concludes that the amount of profit 
<line: 43> to be disgorged by defendants, in connection with Eko Brands’ second claim for unfair 
<line: 44> competition, is as follows: 

[TEXT]
<line: 46> 17 In 2015, the gross profit associated with ECO CARAFE was $1,536,966.  Ex. 274.  This 
<line: 47> amount represented about 27.2% of the gross profit in 2015 for “ECO” products in the aggregate 
<line: 48> ($5,657,602).  Subtracting a pro rata share of the expenses for 2015 ($714,676 = $2,630,738 x 
<line: 49> (1,536,966 ÷ 5,657,602)) yields a net profit of $822,290 for ECO CARAFE devices in 2015.

<line: 36> (docket no. 140). Eko Brands marked for identification, but did not offer, Exhibit 129, which

<line: 39> indicates that, while ARM's share remained fairly steady, Eko Brands lost considerable ground
<line: 40> to Keurig. In other words, Exhibits 80 and 129 suggest that defendants' infringement did not
<line: 41>  cause Eko Brands' loss of sales during the three-year period (February 25, 2016 - January 29,
<line: 42> 2019) shortly preceding trial in this matter. The Court therefore concludes that no purpose

<line: 26> $4.4 million, $3 million, and $2.7 million, respectively.  See Ex. 274; Tr. (Sep. 18, 2019) 
<line: 27> at 369:21-22 (docket no. 140).  Although the figures decreased over the three-year span, 
<line: 28> the sheer quantity of sales belies any sense that Eko Brands has suffered irreparable harm 
<line: 29> to its reputation or goodwill.  Moreover, to the extent confusion between EKOBREW and 
<line: 30> defendants’ “ECO” marks has occurred, Eko Brands has not identified any comments 
<line: 31> that were derogatory of the parties’ respective products nor proven that any EKOBREW 
<line: 32> customer was lost to ARM.  See San Miguel, 625 Fed. App’x at 327.  Eko Brands has not 
<line: 33> shown that defendants’ attempt to exploit the early success of the EKOBREW Marks has 
<line: 34> caused Eko Brands to lose control over its reputation or impacted Eko Brands’ goodwill 
<line: 35> in a manner that has not been compensated by monetary relief. 
<line: 36> 65. 
<line: 37> Eko Brands has, however, demonstrated a significant risk that defendants 
<line: 38> will continue to engage in infringing conduct and that, if defendants are not restricted in 
<line: 39> some manner with respect to the use of “ECO” in their marks, the parties will continue to 
<line: 40> be embroiled in litigation until one or the other or both of them are driven out of business.  
<line: 41> See Anhing Corp. v. Thuan Phong Co., 2015 WL 4517846 at *24 (C.D. Cal. July 24, 
<line: 42> 2015) (observing that injunctive relief avoids giving an infringer “a judicially imposed 
<line: 43> compulsory license” and alleviates the burden on the trademark owner of “filing 
<line: 44> duplicative lawsuits”).  This prospect establishes a form of irreparable injury, as well as 
<line: 45> the inadequacy of damages alone.  It also tips the balance of hardships in favor of some 
<line: 46> injunctive relief and indicates that the public interest in avoiding market confusion and 
<line: 47> efficiently expending judicial resources will be served by limiting defendants’ conduct.  
<line: 48> The Court therefore concludes that a permanent injunction is appropriate, but it must be 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> tailored much more narrowly than Eko Brands has proposed.  In determining the scope of 
<line: 3> injunctive relief, the Court may consider a number of factors, including (i) the nature of 
<line: 4> the interest to be protected, (ii) the nature and extent of the wrongful conduct, (iii) the 
<line: 5> relative harm likely to result to the legitimate interests of the parties if an injunction is 
<line: 6> granted or denied, and (iv) the practicality of framing and enforcing an injunction.  See 
<line: 7> Quiksilver, Inc. v. Kymsta Corp., 360 Fed. App’x 886, 889-90 (9th Cir. 2009); see also 
<line: 8> Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition § 35 (1995) (cited in Quiksilver). 
<line: 9> 66. 
<line: 10> Given (i) the relative weakness of the EKOBREW Marks, and the long 
<line: 11> period of coexistence in the market, during which only three isolated instances of 
<line: 12> confusion have been identified, and (ii) defendants’ extension of the “ECO” line of marks 
<line: 13> (from ECO FILL to ECO CARAFE and ECO-FLOW) during a time when Eko Brands 
<line: 14> had not yet been successful in registering the EKOBREW Marks, Eko Brands’ proposal 
<line: 15> to preclude defendants from using, in connection with coffee products, “ECO” or “EKO” 
<line: 16> alone or in combination with other words or symbols in a service mark, trademark, trade 
<line: 17> name, or domain name is overly broad.  A permanent injunction containing these terms 
<line: 18> (iii) would likely signal the death knell of ARM’s business involving reusable filters and 
<line: 19> related products, while having minimal or no positive effect on Eko Brands’ market 
<line: 20> position, and (iv) might be difficult to enforce in light of the myriad ways in which the 
<line: 21> letters “ECO” or “EKO” could be incorporated into brands or website addresses without 
<line: 22> connoting the environmental conscientiousness underlying the EKOBREW Marks, 
<line: 23> for example, ECONOMY, EKOCHAMBER (a phonetic equivalent of “echo chamber”), 
<line: 24> BEKON (a phonetic equivalent of “beckon”), DÉCOR, RECOVER, or ZYDECO.

<line: 23> Conclusion

[TEXT]
<line: 25> follows:
<line: 26> a.
<line: 27> The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. $ 1338;
<line: 28> b.
<line: 29> The EKOBREW Marks are valid because they are either inherently.
<line: 30> distinctive or they have acquired secondary meaning, and Eko Brands
<line: 31> owned the EKOBREW Marks before defendants began using ECO FILL;
<line: 32> c.
<line: 33> Defendants' use of ECO FILL, ECO CARAFE, ECO-FLOW, ECO
<line: 34> FILTER, ECOSAVE, and ECO-PURE on products similar to those sold by
<line: 35> Eko Brands under the EKOBREW Marks is likely to cause confusion about
<line: 36> the source of the respective goods;
<line: 37> d.
<line: 38> Defendants' adoption of the ECO FILL mark, the first of their "ECO"' style
<line: 39> marks, was willful;.
<line: 40> e.
<line: 41> In light of Eko Brands' award of royalties in the parties' earlier patent
<line: 42> litigation, Eko Brands is not entitled to disgorgement of defendants' profit
