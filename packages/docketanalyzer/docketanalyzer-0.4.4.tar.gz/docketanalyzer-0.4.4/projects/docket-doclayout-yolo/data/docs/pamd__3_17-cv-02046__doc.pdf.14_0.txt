<line: 7> I.
<line: 8> Background

[TEXT]
<line: 10> Plaintiff, an inmate confined in the Mahanoy State Correctional
<line: 11> Institution (“SCI-Mahanoy”), Frackville, Pennsylvania, originally filed the above
<line: 12> captioned civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983, in the Schuylkill
<line: 13> County Court of Common Pleas (Doc. 1). The named Defendants are Correct
<line: 14> Care Solutions; John Steinhart, Correctional Health Care Administrator;
<line: 15> Christopher Oppman, Director of Health Care Service; Theresa DelBalso,
<line: 16> SCI-Mahanoy Superintendent; and John Wetzel, Department of Corrections
<line: 17> Secretary. Id. Plaintiff claims that Defendants provided inadequate medical
<line: 18> treatment with respect to Plaintiff’s medical condition.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Currently pending before the Court are Defendants’ motions to dismiss
<line: 21> Plaintiff’s complaint. (Docs. 7, 9). The motion are fully briefed and are ripe for
<line: 22> disposition. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant the motions. 

[TITLE]
<line: 2> Allegations in Complaint.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> Plaintiff alleges that "on July 13, 2017, and numerous times before, [he].
<line: 5> went to medical for inflammation on [his] eye and [he] was told it was a stye
<line: 6> on [his] eye. (Doc. 1). He was "given antibiotics and drops and was told to use
<line: 7> a hot rag and it would go away." Id. Plaintiff states that "for over a month [his]
<line: 8> eye was/is in pain and swollen." Id. He was "last given some different
<line: 9> medication but nothing has changed, my eye is still inflamed and painful." Id.
<line: 10> Plaintiff claims that he was "informed over a month ago that [he] would be
<line: 11> sent out to have surgery and until this day nothing has happened." Id.

[TEXT]
<line: 13> On July 14, 2017, Plaintiff filed Grievance No. 687530, "in an attempt.
<line: 14> to resolve the failure to properly treat the stye." Id. By Initial review response.
<line: 15> dated August 1, 2017, Grievance No. 687530 was denied. Id. A timely appeal
<line: 16> to the Facility Manager was taken on August 8, 2017 and the denial was
<line: 17> affirmed on August 18, 2017. Id. An August 24, 2017 appeal to Final Review.
<line: 18> was referred to the Bureau of Health Care Services on August 31, 2017 and
<line: 19> was denied on September 27, 2017. Id.

[TEXT]
<line: 21> Plaintiff files the instant action, claiming that "there is no medical
<line: 22> justification for the Defendants' failure to properly treat Plaintiff's stye by.
<line: 23> opening and draining it" and that "their actions and inactions have caused and.
<line: 24> continue to cause Plaintiff pain, suffering and emotional distress." Id.
<line: 25> Specifically, Plaintiff states that Defendants, Steinhart and Oppman
<line: 26> disregarded their duties "by negligently and carelessly allowing Plaintiff's

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> rights under Pennsylvania law to be violated by medical personnel at SCI-
<line: 3> Mahanoy's negligent conduct in regard to the treatment of Plaintiff's stye." Id.
<line: 4> He claims that "Defendant, Correct Care Solutions, as Medical Care Provider
<line: 5> is the policy maker at SCl-Mahanoy regarding medical treatment", and "it was
<line: 6> policy, practice and/or custom for Correct Care Solutions to fail to adequately
<line: 7> treat and/or to dump inmates who require extensive and/or expensive medical
<line: 8> care." Id. Plaintiff believes that "the above described policies, practices and
<line: 9> customs demonstrated a deliberate indifference on the part of Defendant[s],
<line: 10> DelBalso and Wetzel, to the constitutional rights of person within Mahanoy,
<line: 11> and were the cause of the violations of Plaintiff's rights as alleged herein." Id.
<line: 12> For relief, Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages. Id.

<line: 15> Motion to Dismiss

[TEXT]
<line: 17> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) authorizes dismissal of a complaint for "failure to.
<line: 18> state a claim upon which relief can be granted." Under Rule 12(b)(6), we must
<line: 19> 'accept all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most
<line: 20> favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable
<line: 21> reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief." Fowler v.
<line: 22> UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting Phillips v.
<line: 23> County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 231 (3d Cir. 2008)). While a complaint
<line: 24> need only contain "a short and plain statement of the claim," Fed.R.Civ.P.
<line: 25> 8(a)(2), and detailed factual allegations are not required, Bell Atlantic Corp.

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007), a complaint must plead "enough facts
<line: 3> to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Id. at 570. "The
<line: 4> plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for
<line: 5> more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully." Ashcroft
<line: 6> v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). "[L]abels
<line: 7> and conclusions" are not enough, Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, and a court "is
<line: 8> not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual
<line: 9> allegation." Id. (quoted case omitted).

[TEXT]
<line: 11> In resolving the motion to dismiss, we thus "conduct a two-part
<line: 12> analysis." Fowler, supra, 578 F.3d at 210. First, we separate the factual
<line: 13> elements from the legal elements and disregard the legal conclusions. Id. at
<line: 14> 210-11. Second, we "determine whether the facts alleged in the complaint are
<line: 15> sufficient to show that the plaintiff has a "plausible claim for relief". Id. at 211
<line: 16> (quoted case omitted).

[TEXT]
<line: 18> In addition, because Plaintiff complains about "prison conditions," the
<line: 19> screening provisions of 42 U.S.C. $1997e apply, as do the screening
<line: 20> provisions of 28 U.S.C. S1915(e), given that he was granted in forma pauperis
<line: 21> status to pursue this suit. The court's obligation to dismiss a complaint under
<line: 22> the PLRA screening provisions for complaints that fail to state a claim is not
<line: 23> excused even after defendants have filed a motion to dismiss. See, e.g.,
<line: 24> Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1126 n. 6 (9th Cir. 2000). Hence, if there is
<line: 25> a ground for dismissal which was not relied upon by a defendant in a motion

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> to dismiss, the court may nonetheless sua sponte rest its dismissal upon such
<line: 3> ground pursuant to the screening provisions of the PLRA. Id..

<line: 6> Discussion

[TITLE]
<line: 8> A. Eighth Amendment Medical Claim.

[TEXT]
<line: 10> In order to establish an Eighth Amendment medical claim, a plaintiff
<line: 11> must show "(i) a serious medical need, and (ii) acts or omissions by prison
<line: 12> officials that indicate deliberate indifference to that need." Natale v. Camden
<line: 13> Cty. Correctional Facility, 318 F.3d 575, 582 (3d Cir. 2003). See also Rouse.
<line: 14> v. Plantier, 182 F.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir. 1999). A serious medical need is one
<line: 15> that has been diagnosed by a physician as requiring treatment, or one that is
<line: 16> so obvious that a layperson would recognize the need for a doctor's attention.
<line: 17> Monmouth County Correctional Institutional Inmates v. Lanzaro, 834 F.2d
<line: 18> 326, 347 (3d Cir. 1987). In addition, "if unnecessary and wanton infliction of
<line: 19> pain results as a consequence of denial or delay in the provision of adequate
<line: 20> medical care, the medical need is of the serious nature contemplated by the
<line: 21> eighth amendment." Id.

[TEXT]
<line: 23> A prison official acts with deliberate indifference to an inmate's serious
<line: 24> medical needs when he "knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate
<line: 25> health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the
<line: 26> inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and
<line: 27> he must also draw the inference." Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> (1994). Thus, a complaint that a physician or a medical department "has been
<line: 3> negligent in diagnosing or treating a medical condition does not state a valid.
<line: 4> claim of medical mistreatment under the Eighth Amendment..." Estelle v..
<line: 5> Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976). For instance, a "medical decision not to
<line: 6> order an X-ray, or like measures, does not represent cruel and unusual
<line: 7> punishment. At most it is medical malpractice." Id., 429 U.S. at 107. "[A]s long.
<line: 8> as a physician exercises professional judgment his behavior will not violate
<line: 9> a prisoner's constitutional rights." Brown v. Borough of Chambersburg, 903
<line: 10> F.2d 274, 278 (3d Cir. 1990). Further, a doctor's disagreement with the
<line: 11> professional judgment of another doctor is not actionable under the Eighth
<line: 12> Amendment. See White v. Napoleon, 897 F.2d 103, 110 (3d Cir. 1990). In
<line: 13> sum, negligence, unsuccessful medical treatment, or medical malpractice
<line: 14> does not give rise to a g1983 cause of action, and an inmate's disagreement
<line: 15> with medical treatment is insufficient to establish deliberate indifference. See
<line: 16> Durmer v. O'Carroll, 991 F.2d 64, 69 (3d Cir. 1993)

[TEXT]
<line: 18> Further, a prison administrator cannot be found deliberately indifferent.
<line: 19> under the Eighth Amendment because he or she fails to respond to the
<line: 20> medical complaints of an inmate being treated by a prison physician, or
<line: 21> because, as non-physicians, they defer to the medical judgment of the
<line: 22> inmate's treating physicians. Id., 991 F.2d at 69. If, however, non-medical
<line: 23> prison personnel had "a reason to believe (or actual knowledge) that prison
<line: 24> doctors or their assistants are mistreating (or not treating) a prisoner," liability

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> may be imposed. Spruill, 372 F.3d 236

[TEXT]
<line: 4> A mere difference of opinion between the prison's medical staff and the.
<line: 5> inmate regarding the diagnosis or treatment which the inmate receives does
<line: 6> not support a claim of cruel and unusual punishment. Farmer v. Carlson, 685
<line: 7> F. Supp. 1335, 1339 (M.D. Pa. 1988). See McCracken v. Jones, 562 F.2d 22
<line: 8> 24 (10th Cir. 1977); Smart v. Villar, 547 F.2d 112, 113 (10th Cir. 1976)

[TEXT]
<line: 10> Additionally, if there is a dispute over the adequacy of the received.
<line: 11> treatment, courts have consistently been reluctant to second guess the
<line: 12> medical judgment of the attending physician. Little v. Lycoming County, 912
<line: 13> F. Supp. 809, 815 (M.D. Pa.), aff'd, 101 F.3d 691 (3d Cir. 1996). The key
<line: 14> question is whether the defendant has provided the plaintiff with some type
<line: 15> of treatment, regardless of whether it is what the plaintiff desires. Farmer v.
<line: 16> Carlson, 685 F. Supp. at 1339

[TEXT]
<line: 18> Assuming, without deciding, that Plaintiff's medical needs were serious
<line: 19> in the constitutional sense, the allegations in Plaintiff's complaint clearly
<line: 20> demonstrate that Plaintiff received medical attention, and that the attention
<line: 21> Plaintiff received lacks the requisite deliberate indifference to support a
<line: 22> Section 1983 claim. Plaintiff, himself, states that he was seen "on July 13,
<line: 23> 2017 and numerous times before", and was prescribed antibiotics, drops and.
<line: 24> other medication.

[TEXT]
<line: 26> At best, Plaintiff's complaint demonstrates his disagreement with the
<line: 27> type of treatment rendered. Though he may have wished to have a doctor

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> open the stye and drain it, his disagreement with the course of action that was
<line: 3> taken is not enough to state a $1983 claim. Sample v. Diecks, 885 F.2d 1099
<line: 4> 1109 (3d Cir.1989) (citing Estelle, 429 U.S. at 105-06 (in the medical context,
<line: 5> an inadvertent failure to provide adequate medical care cannot be said to
<line: 6> constitute an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain or to be repugnant to
<line: 7> the conscience of mankind)). This is particularly so in light of the fact that
<line: 8> there are no allegations in the complaint that any of the Defendants
<line: 9> intentionally withheld medical treatment from Plaintiff in order to inflict pain or
<line: 10> harm upon Plaintiff. Farmer; Rouse. To the extent that Plaintiff states that he
<line: 11> was "informed over a month ago that [he] would be sent out to have surgery.
<line: 12> and until this day nothing has happened", does not demonstrate an intentional
<line: 13> withholding, or unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. In fact, it shows that
<line: 14> Defendants continue to be attentive to Plaintiff's situation. Thus, the
<line: 15> allegations in the Plaintiff's complaint amount to nothing more than Plaintiff's
<line: 16> subjective disagreement with the treatment decisions and medical judgment
<line: 17> of the medical staff at the prison. At most, the allegations in the complaint only
<line: 18> rise to the level of mere negligence. As simple negligence can not serve as.
<line: 19> a predicate to liability under $1983, Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984),
<line: 20> Plaintiff's civil rights complaint fails to articulate an arguable claim. See.
<line: 21> White, 897 F.2d at 108-110.
<line: 22> Moreover, to the extent that Plaintiff believes that he has been
<line: 23> misdiagnosed, mere misdiagnosis or negligent treatment is not actionable as

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> an Eighth Amendment claim because medical malpractice is not a
<line: 3> constitutional violation. Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106. Indeed, prison authorities are
<line: 4> accorded considerable latitude in the diagnosis and treatment of prisoners.
<line: 5> Durmer, 991 F.2d at 67. Once again, "mere disagreements over medical
<line: 6>  judgment" do not rise to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation. White,
<line: 7> 897 F.2d at 110.

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Plaintiff asserts a 1983 claim against CCS, a limited liability company
<line: 13> that provides health care services to SCI-Mahanoy under contract. A private
<line: 14> corporation providing health services to inmates may be liable under g1983
<line: 15> to the extent its policies or customs exhibit deliberate indifference to a
<line: 16> prisoner's serious medical needs. Leflar v. Algarin, Civ. No. 16-6567, 2017
<line: 17> WL 1425835, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 19, 2017); Edwards v. Northampton Cty.,

<line: 19> 663 Fed.Appx. 132 (3d Cir. 2016), A plaintiff must show that a relevant policy
<line: 20> or custom cause the constitutional violation at issue. Natale, 318 F.3d at 583-
<line: 21> 84, ("In order for PHS to be liable, the [plaintiffs] must provide evidence that
<line: 22> there was a relevant PHS policy or custom, and that the policy caused the
<line: 23> constitutional violation they allege.").

[TEXT]
<line: 25> In the absence of a predicate constitutional injury, however, there can
<line: 26> be no liability on the part of CCS. Cessna v. Corr. Med. Servs., 794 F.Supp.2d
<line: 27> 544, 550 (D.Del. 2011)("The court has concluded that Dr. Wallace did not

<line: 5> plaintiff’s rights.”) (citing Goodrich v. Clinton Cty. Prison, 214 Fed.Appx. 105,
<line: 6> 113 (3d Cir. 2007)).
<line: 7> Here, Plaintiff has failed to assert facts that could plausibly establish a
<line: 8> violation of his Eighth Amendment rights. Moreover, Plaintiff has not asserted
<line: 9> that his health care providers acted in a manner that was deliberately
<line: 10> indifferent to his serious medical needs. In any event, however, Plaintiff’s own
<line: 11> allegations indicate that he was seen by medical staff on numerous
<line: 12> occasions. During the course of his treatment, Plaintiff was given antibiotics
<line: 13> and eye drops. As noticed, he complains that the stye should have been
<line: 14> opened and drained. Based on the facts alleged, Plaintiff has not
<line: 15> demonstrated that prison medical personnel were deliberately indifferent to
<line: 16> his serious medical needs. See Matthews v. Pa. Dep’t of Corr., 613 Fed.Appx.
<line: 17> 163, 170 (3d Cir. 2015), (prison medical officials were not deliberately
<line: 18> indifferent to plaintiff's Achilles tendonitis, where complaint allegations showed

<line: 20> not to participate in certain physical activities during his recovery; to the extent
<line: 21> they exposed him to greater risk of injury by refusing to recommend a cell

<line: 22> failing to dictate an alternative course of treatment. See Durmer v. O'Carroll,
<line: 23> 991 F.2d 64, 69 (3d Cir. 1993) (ruling that non-medical defendants "[could

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Here, Plaintiff’s allegations establish that he was under continuous

[TEXT]
<line: 15> In addition, Plaintiff’s claims against DelBalso are deficient to the extent
<line: 16> they are predicated on DelBalso’s denial of Plaintiff's grievance appeal. A
<line: 17> prison official’s participation in grievance processes, including appeals, fails
<line: 18> to establish the requisite personal involvement.” Brooks v. Beard, 167
<line: 19> Fed.Appx. 923, 925 (3d Cir. 2006) (“Although the complaint alleges that
<line: 20> [prison officials] responded inappropriately to [the plaintiff’s] later-filed

[TEXT]
<line: 24> In sum, Plaintiff has failed to plead a plausible constitutional violation for
<line: 25> which DelBalso could be liable. Even if he had, DelBalso’s participation in the

<line: 8> Leave to Amend

[TEXT]
<line: 10> The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has stated that,.
<line: 11> in civil rights cases, pro se plaintiffs should generally be afforded an
<line: 12> opportunity to amend a complaint before the complaint is dismissed in its
<line: 13> entirety, Fletcher-Harlee Corp v. Pote Concrete Contractors, 482 F.3d 247,
<line: 14> 253 (3d Cir. 2007), unless granting further leave to amend would be
<line: 15> inequitable or futile. Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d
<line: 16> Cir. 2002). Based on the foregoing, the Court finds futility in allowing Plaintiff
<line: 17> to amend his Complaint because, as discussed, Plaintiff's complaint fails as
<line: 18> a matter of law, as his disagreement with the course of treatment received
<line: 19> does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.
