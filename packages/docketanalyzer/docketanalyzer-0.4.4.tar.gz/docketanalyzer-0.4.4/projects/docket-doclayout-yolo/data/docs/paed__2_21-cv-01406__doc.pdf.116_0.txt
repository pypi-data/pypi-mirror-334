<line: 20> MEMORANDUM OPINION 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> After a vigorously litigated trial concerning a purported agreement to produce hand 
<line: 23> sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic, the parties in this case energetically dispute the 
<line: 24> amount of costs that can be taxed against the Plaintiffs.1  Following a five-day trial, the jury 
<line: 25> found in favor of Defendant Five Below, Inc. (“Five Below”) on both counts of the Complaint—
<line: 26> breach of contract and promissory estoppel.  Judgment was entered in Five Below’s favor, and it 
<line: 27> subsequently filed a Bill of Costs seeking, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1920, to tax Plaintiffs K7 
<line: 28> Design Group, Inc. and K7 Design Group, LLC (collectively, “K7”) for five categories of 
<line: 29> expenses: service costs; witness costs; transcript costs; copying costs; and trial technician costs.  
<line: 30> In total, Five Below seeks $65,303.19.  For the reasons that follow, Five Below’s Bill of Costs 
<line: 31> will be granted in part, with the amount taxable to be reduced to $28,665.35.

<line: 32> A. Service Costs

<line: 34> Five Below seeks to tax $1,445.49 in costs incurred serving non-party subpoenas on the 
<line: 35> warehouses used by K7—California Distribution Center, High Tech Logistics, and HK Trans 
<line: 36> LLC—as well as subsequent motions and orders to enforce the subpoena of HK Trans LLC in 
<line: 37> 2021 and 2022.  The subpoenas “sought records related to the shipment, transfer, and billing” of

<line: 5> through these subpoenas was eventually introduced as a trial exhibit.  Five Below served these 
<line: 6> documents through private process servers.

<line: 8> “Costs of serving testimonial and document subpoenas on witnesses and third parties may 
<line: 9> be recovered” under Section 1920(1) if “the issuance of the subpoena was reasonable and

<line: 11> v. Bengal, 2013 WL 5309269, at *10 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 23, 2013).  However, as Section 1920(1) 
<line: 12> pertains to “fees of the clerk and the marshal,” courts in this district have limited costs of private 
<line: 13> process servers to the rate that the United States Marshals Service would have charged to effect 
<line: 14> service.3  See Kovalev v. Weiss, 2021 WL 1897761, at *6 (E.D. Pa. May 5, 2021), aff’d sub nom.

[TEXT]
<line: 18> The Marshals Service fees are “$65 per hour (or portion thereof) for each item served . . . 
<line: 19> plus travel costs,” 28 C.F.R. § 0.114; travel costs included mileage reimbursement at a rate of 
<line: 20> $0.56 per mile in 2021 and $0.585 per mile in 2022.  5 U.S.C. § 5704: (a)(1); POV Mileage

<line: 28> damages.”  At trial, K7 “abandoned its demand for storage costs”; however, Five Below argues, it was still 
<line: 29> reasonable and necessary to seek this information at the time it served its subpoenas.

<line: 5> litigation, these subpoenas were reasonable and necessary at the time of service, and these.
<line: 6> service costs---limited to the Marshals Service's rates--are taxable. Because Five Below

<line: 5> Farrajota Meal Expenses 

[TEXT]
<line: 7> Five Below seeks to recover costs connected to fact witness Idalia Farrajota’s appearance 
<line: 8> at two depositions, one in Philadelphia and one in New York.  K7 objects to including a $47 
<line: 9> meal expense charged after Farrajota’s New York deposition.  K7 is correct that this expense is 
<line: 10> not taxable under Sections 1920 and 1821.   

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Section 1821(d)(1)-(2) allows witnesses to be paid a “subsistence allowance” not to 
<line: 13> exceed the maximum per diem rate set by the General Services Administration (“GSA”). The 
<line: 14> GSA per diem rates include meal expenses.  See 41 C.F.R. § 300-3.1 (defining “subsistence 
<line: 15> allowance” to include meals); Frequently Asked Questions, Per Diem, U.S. Gen. Servs. Admin., 
<line: 16> https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates/faq#1 (last visited June 16, 2023) (“Per 
<line: 17> diem is an allowance for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses.”).  

[TEXT]
<line: 19>   However, this subsistence allowance is only permitted when witnesses must make “an 
<line: 20> overnight stay . . . at the place of attendance.”  28 U.S.C. 1821(d)(1).  The documentation of 
<line: 21> Farrajota’s travel expenses relating to her New York deposition indicates single-day travel: all 
<line: 22> charges occurred on the same day, and they include a morning Uber receipt to a Philadelphia 
<line: 23> train station and Amtrak charges that evening.  Her meal expenses are therefore not taxable, and 
<line: 24> the amount claimed by Five Below for her deposition appearances will be reduced to $112.47.

<line: 29> Rather than the standard $40 daily appearance fee provided for by Section 1821(b), Five 
<line: 30> Below seeks to recover the full fee charged by its testifying supply chain expert, Jay Kent.  Kent 
<line: 31> was deposed during discovery and attended all five days of trial, although he only testified on the 
<line: 32> final two days.  Five Below seeks to tax $3,250 for his appearance at his deposition—ten hours

<line: 4> hour days at a rate of $350 an hour.  These fees are not taxable under Sections 1821 and 1920, 
<line: 5> which “do not authorize an award for . . . expert witness fees. . . . ”  Rimini St., Inc. v. Oracle 
<line: 6> USA, Inc., 139 S. Ct. 873, 878 (2019); see also In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 221 F.3d at 464 
<line: 7> (“[T]he types of costs recoverable under Rule 54(d)(1) are quite circumscribed. . . . [T]hese costs 
<line: 8> ‘do not include such litigation expenses as attorney’s fees and expert witness fees in excess of 
<line: 9> the standard daily witness fee[.]’”) (quoting Friedman v. Ganassi, 853 F.2d 207, 209 (3d Cir. 
<line: 10> 1988)).5  Kent’s appearances are taxable at the $40 per day witness appearance rate, not his 
<line: 11> expert rate, and will therefore be reduced. 

[TEXT]
<line: 13> K7 raises an additional objection with respect to Kent—although Kent only testified 
<line: 14> during two days of trial, Five Below seeks to recover costs for all five days he attended.  
<line: 15> Attending but not testifying at trial is taxable when there exists a reasonable expectation that the 
<line: 16> witness may be called.  See, e.g., Greene v. Fraternal Ord. of Police, 183 F.R.D. 445, 450 (E.D. 
<line: 17> Pa. 1998) (“[C]osts are properly taxed when there is a good faith expectation that witnesses 
<line: 18> might be called and had to be made available for that eventuality.”); Smith v. Crown Equip. 
<line: 19> Corp., 2000 WL 62314, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 13, 2000) (holding that the taxation of costs for a 
<line: 20> witness’s two days of trial attendance was proper even though the witness only testified for one 
<line: 21> day); Farley v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 1997 WL 537406, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 1, 1997) (“Having a 
<line: 22> witness available a day in advance is reasonable”).

<line: 24> During the opening, defense counsel told the jury that Kent was “a retail supply-chain 
<line: 25> expert” who “will talk to you . . . about why the industry uniformly requires purchase orders as 

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 5 In addition to arguing that expert fees are not taxable under Section 1920, K7 argues that the Court should reject 
<line: 28> Kent’s fees because his testimony “was not reasonably necessary or helpful to the Court” and “[i]t is highly unlikely 
<line: 29> that his trial appearance played any role in the jury’s verdict[.]”  This argument is based on counsel’s self-
<line: 30> assessment that his cross-examination was so successful that it revealed Kent to be a “buffoon.”  In addition to being 
<line: 31> beside the point given the precedent cited above and difficult to square with the fact that the jury found wholly in 
<line: 32> Five Below’s favor, this vitriolic characterization is inappropriate.

<line: 4> the mechanism to require goods.”  At no point did Plaintiffs suggest that it was possible that they 
<line: 5> might decide to call Kent as a witness in their case.  Accordingly, there was no need for Kent 
<line: 6> (except to the extent that Defendant was inclined to ask him to attend and there was no valid 
<line: 7> objection to his presence) to be in the courtroom during Plaintiffs’ case-in-chief.   

[TEXT]
<line: 9> During the trial, at the end of each day the Court checked in with the parties to evaluate 
<line: 10> what was likely to occur during the next trial day.  At the end of the first day of trial, the 
<line: 11> Plaintiffs informed the Court that the entirety of the next trial day would be filled with their 
<line: 12> witnesses’ testimony.  Accordingly, it was not necessary for Kent to attend the second day of 
<line: 13> trial. 

[TEXT]
<line: 15> At the end of the second day of trial, Plaintiffs’ counsel informed the Court that it had 
<line: 16> two witnesses to put on the next day.  From a discussion with the parties the Court concluded 
<line: 17> that the day after that (the fourth day of trial) it would be Defendant’s turn to present evidence. 

[TEXT]
<line: 19> Finally, on the third day of trial, Plaintiffs’ counsel informed the Court that he would rest 
<line: 20> the following day.  Defense counsel then indicated that Kent would testify shortly 
<line: 21> thereafter.  Accordingly, it was necessary that Kent be available on the fourth day of trial.  In 
<line: 22> fact, he was called by Defendant to testify on the fourth day of trial which testimony continued 
<line: 23> into the fifth day of trial.   

[TEXT]
<line: 25> Three days of Kent’s attendance are therefore taxable under Section 1920 at the standard 
<line: 26> witness appearance rate of $40 a day—the one day of his deposition testimony and the two days 
<line: 27> of his trial testimony.  Five Below is not, however, entitled to costs for his attendance on the first 
<line: 28> three days of trial, which he attended “to listen to live witness testimony and understand the 
<line: 29> exhibits entered in evidence” and during which there was no reasonable expectation he would 
<line: 30> testify.  See Farley, 1997 WL 537406 at *3 (declining to tax costs for a witness’s attendance at

<line: 8> Kent Travel Costs 

[TEXT]
<line: 10> As Five Below claims that Kent’s travel was obtained at the most economical rate 
<line: 11> available and K7 has provided no evidence to the contrary, his travel costs are fully taxable.  See 
<line: 12> 28 U.S.C. § 1821(c)(1) (“A witness who travels by common carrier shall be paid for the actual 
<line: 13> expenses of travel. . . . Such a witness shall utilize a common carrier at the most economical rate 
<line: 14> reasonably available.”).  Five Below acknowledges that Kent’s actual meal and lodging expenses 
<line: 15> exceeded the GSA per diem rate and should therefore be reduced.  Kent’s lodging costs are 
<line: 16> therefore limited to $227.85 per day (the GSA per diem lodging rate for Philadelphia), for two 
<line: 17> days; his meals and incidentals costs are limited to $59.25, the per diem rate for the first and last 
<line: 18> day of travel.  FY 2023 Per Diem Rates for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S. Gen. Servs. Admin,

[TEXT]
<line: 21> In total, then, Five Below is entitled to $306.85 for his travel and lodging expenses 
<line: 22> connected to his deposition, and $1,603.51 for travel, lodging, and meal expenses incurred as a 
<line: 23> result of his trial attendance.  

[TEXT]
<line: 25> As K7 does not object to the other witness fees requested by Five Below,6 they will be

<line: 4> included in Five Below’s requested transcript costs.  K7’s blanket objection to deposition 
<line: 5> transcript costs is that Five Below has not explained “why any of the deposition transcripts were 
<line: 6> necessarily obtained for use in this case.”  K7 then objects to the following discrete fees included 
<line: 7> in Five Below’s claimed transcript costs: (1) costs for expedited preparation of deposition 
<line: 8> transcripts; (2) costs for condensed copies of deposition transcripts; (3) costs for transcript 
<line: 9> handling and processing; (4) costs labelled “transcript technology package and litigation 
<line: 10> technology support”; and (5) costs labelled “video pages.”  In response, Five Below argues that 
<line: 11> these are all “routine industry costs accompanying the preparation” of deposition transcripts, a 
<line: 12> response that is inadequate given that courts disallow certain categories of transcript-related costs 
<line: 13> even if charged by vendors.  See, e.g., Duchesneau v. Cornell Univ., 2015 WL 619609, at *6-7 
<line: 14> (E.D. Pa. Feb. 11, 2015) (disallowing fees for condensed transcripts).  

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Section 1920 permits recovery of “[f]ees for printed or electronically recorded transcripts 
<line: 17> necessarily obtained for use in the case.”  28 U.S.C. § 1920(2); see also Quagliarello v. Dewees, 
<line: 18> 2012 WL 3279212, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 10, 2012) (finding transcript costs taxable if 
<line: 19> “necessarily incurred in the preparation of effective litigation”).  K7 would limit recoverable 
<line: 20> transcript costs only to those introduced as trial exhibits.  As Section 1920 permits recovery for 
<line: 21> transcripts “necessarily obtained for use in the case,” not those only obtained for use in trial, this 
<line: 22> is an overly narrow reading.  See In re Baby Food Antitrust Litig., 166 F.3d 112, 138-39 (3d Cir.

[TEXT]
<line: 6> K7’s objections to more specific fees are up next.  K7 first objects to fees for expedited 
<line: 7> deposition transcripts.  Fees for expedited transcripts are not taxable when incurred “solely for 
<line: 8> the convenience of counsel.”  Montgomery County v. Microvote Corp., 2004 WL 1087196, at *6 
<line: 9> (E.D. Pa. May 13, 2004); In re Kulicke, 747 F. Supp. at 1147 (finding fees for expedited 
<line: 10> transcripts not “necessarily obtained” and disallowing them).  Here, however, Five Below seeks 
<line: 11> costs for expedited deposition transcripts of two experts, Kent and Gary Simmons, that took 
<line: 12> place approximately two weeks before the deadline for summary judgment and Daubert motions.  
<line: 13> Expediting transcripts was necessary under these circumstances, rather than merely for the 
<line: 14> convenience of counsel, and these fees are therefore taxable under Section 1920. 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> K7 also objects to costs for condensed copies of transcripts.  These will be disallowed.  
<line: 17> See Duchesneau, 2015 WL 619609 at *6-7.  Five Below’s explanation that such costs are 
<line: 18> “routine” does not explain why they were necessarily incurred.  K7 next objects to “handling and 
<line: 19> processing” fees included in transcript costs.  As “[a] party may not recover the shipping and 
<line: 20> handling costs associated with depositions,” and Five Below has provided no information 
<line: 21> indicating these fees relate to some other permissible costs, these will be disallowed.  In re 
<line: 22> Aspartame Antitrust Litig., 817 F. Supp.2d 608, 617 (E.D. Pa. 2011); cf. In re Penn Cent. 
<line: 23> Transp. Co., 630 F.2d at 191 (holding “postage and courier fees” nontaxable under the Federal 
<line: 24> Rules of Appellate Procedure).  Costs for “transcript technology package and litigation 
<line: 25> technology support” will also be disallowed as these services appear to be for the convenience of 
<line: 26> counsel, as opposed to necessarily obtained.   

[TEXT]
<line: 28> Finally, the fees labelled “video pages” will be disallowed.  Five Below explains that this 
<line: 29> charge “is assessed when a videographer attends the deposition” and “review[s] the video against

<line: 4> the transcript” to ensure accuracy.  As this service not necessary to produce the transcript—two 
<line: 5> of the attached transcript invoices do not include a “video pages” charge—these costs are 
<line: 6> duplicative and not taxable.  See In re Aspartame Antitrust Litig., 817 F. Supp.2d at 617 (holding 
<line: 7> that prevailing parties cannot “recover the costs of both transcripts and videotapes of 
<line: 8> depositions”).    

[TEXT]
<line: 10> As K7 does not object to Five Below’s request for fees incurred by obtaining daily trial 
<line: 11> transcripts, these costs will be taxed.  Five Below is therefore entitled to $22,589.42 total in 
<line: 12> transcript costs.

<line: 14> D. Copying Costs 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Five Below seeks to tax $3,579.107 for the costs of making copies of documents 
<line: 17> necessarily obtained for use in the case which, here, include the costs of providing exhibit 
<line: 18> binders for the Court and for witnesses to refer to while testifying.  “[T]he costs of making 
<line: 19> copies of any materials where the copies are necessarily obtained for use in the case” are taxable 
<line: 20> under 28 U.S.C. § 1920(4).  “The party seeking reimbursement for copying costs must describe 
<line: 21> the purpose of the charge with sufficient specificity,” and “[t]he cost per page and the number of 
<line: 22> copies cannot be excessive.”  E.C. v. Sch. Dist. of Phila., 91 F. Supp.3d 598, 616-17 (E.D. Pa. 
<line: 23> 2015). 

[TEXT]
<line: 25> K7 argues that that Five Below’s documentation of its copying costs is not sufficiently 
<line: 26> itemized to permit their recovery.  Although Five Below’s documentation provides a “work 
<line: 27> date,” number of pages copied, and cost per page ($0.15), it does not provide a description of 
<line: 28> each document copied.  Such a detailed level of itemization has not been found necessary, and 
<line: 29> the description provided in the Bill of Costs—explaining that these charges reflect document

<line: 4> printing for attorney document review; deposition and trial preparation; and deposition, motion, 
<line: 5> and trial exhibits—is sufficient to permit recovery.  See Laura P. v. Haverford Sch. Dist., 2009 
<line: 6> WL 1651286, at *9 (E.D. Pa. June 12, 2009) (finding the descriptions “copies for hearing,” 
<line: 7> “copies of research for hearing,” “copies for reply brief,” and “copies of exhibits” sufficiently 
<line: 8> specific to permit the recovery of copying costs), abrogated on other grounds by Steven I. v. 
<line: 9> Central Bucks Sch. Dist., 618 F.3d 411 (3d Cir. 2010); Microvote, 2004 WL 1087196, at *7 
<line: 10> (“While the prevailing party is not expected to provide a detailed description of every piece of 
<line: 11> paper copied, it is expected to provide the ‘best breakdown of the copied material obtainable 
<line: 12> from its records.’”).  And the $0.15 per copy charges are within the range that courts in this 
<line: 13> district have found reasonable.  In re Aspartame Antitrust Litig., 817 F. Supp.2d at 618 (“Courts 
<line: 14> in the Third Circuit have routinely held that copying costs of $0.25/page . . . were reasonable.”).  
<line: 15> The number of copies is also reasonable given the document-intensive nature of the case.  

[TEXT]
<line: 17> However, the entirety of the color copying Five Below seeks to recover has a work date 
<line: 18> of February 16, 2021, meaning these costs were incurred over a month before K7 filed its 
<line: 19> Complaint on March 24, 2021.  Although these pre-litigation costs may have been “necessary to 
<line: 20> effective and competent representation,” E.C., 91 F. Supp.3d at 617, Five Below has provided no 
<line: 21> argument or information demonstrating that they were.  Five Below describes these costs as 
<line: 22> necessary for “attorney document review, preparation for discovery production, and 
<line: 23> depositions,” without explaining why this work occurred prior to the filing of the Complaint.  
<line: 24> These costs, totaling $118.60, will therefore be disallowed.8  For the same reason, nine entries 
<line: 25> for regular copying also dated February 16, 2021 and totaling $23.40 will also be disallowed.   

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 8 Moreover, although color copying may be necessary and therefore taxable in certain circumstances, losing parties 
<line: 28> are not responsible for “unnecessary aesthetic costs” or their opponents’ “glitz.”  In re Aspartame Antitrust Litig., 
<line: 29> 817 F. Supp.2d at 619.  As a result, a party seeking to recover color copying costs must demonstrate why color 
<line: 30> copies, specifically, were necessary.  Five Below has not done so.

<line: 6> E. Trial Technician Costs 

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Finally, Five Below seeks to recover the costs of a trial technician who aided in the 
<line: 9> electronic presentation of exhibits at trial.  Five Below argues that these costs fit within the 
<line: 10> definition of “exemplification” under Section 1920(4).  Although it has distinguished 
<line: 11> “‘exemplification’ from ‘making copies,’” Race Tires Am., Inc. v. Hoosier Racing Tire Corp., 
<line: 12> 674 F.3d 158, 165-66 (3d Cir. 2012), the Third Circuit has not specifically defined the term or 
<line: 13> determined whether it extends to trial technician costs.  It has, however, “narrowly interpreted” 
<line: 14> other portions of Section 1920.  See Mylan Inc. v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 2015 WL 
<line: 15> 1931139, at *15 (D.N.J. Apr. 28, 2015) (describing the Third Circuit’s interpretation of “cost of 
<line: 16> making copies” in Race Tires as “widely considered to be the most restrictive in the country on 
<line: 17> that issue”).  A narrow interpretation of “exemplification” is also consistent with the Supreme 
<line: 18> Court’s direction that: 

[TEXT]
<line: 20> [W]e have never held that Rule 54(d) creates a presumption of statutory 
<line: 21> construction in favor of the broadest possible reading of the costs enumerated in 
<line: 22> § 1920. To the contrary, we have made clear that the “discretion granted by Rule 
<line: 23> 54(d) is not a power to evade” the specific categories of costs set forth by Congress.  
<line: 24> “Rather,” we have said, “it is solely a power to decline to tax, as costs, the items 
<line: 25> enumerated in § 1920.”

<line: 29> District courts in this circuit have therefore disallowed the taxation of trial technician costs.  See, 
<line: 30> e.g., Alzheimer’s Inst. of Am., Inc. v. Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, 2016 WL 1161349, at *1-2 
<line: 31> (E.D. Pa. Mar. 23, 2016) (“The expense of having vendors at trial to present exhibits and aids 
<line: 32> electronically is . . . not taxable. . . . The cost of preparing the format for presenting a party’s 
<line: 33> exhibits in a manner favored by that party should not be borne by the other party.”).  Courtroom

<line: 4> support costs have also been denied on the grounds that it “is the type of activity typically 
<line: 5> performed by paralegals or support staff employed at a law firm, and is therefore akin to 
<line: 6> attorneys fees, which are not recoverable as costs.”  Mylan Inc., 2015 WL 1931139, at *16

[TEXT]
<line: 10> Five Below’s argument that similar reasoning does not apply here is unpersuasive, and its 
<line: 11> request for trial technician costs will therefore be denied.  It argues that Alzheimer’s Institute of 
<line: 12> America, Inc. is distinguishable because that court disallowed trial technician costs “because 
<line: 13> there were no issues that needed to be exemplified at trial” while “[t]he opposite is true here.”  
<line: 14> This is an inaccurate characterization.  The Alzheimer’s Institute court rejected the defendant’s 
<line: 15> argument that a trial support was necessary “to simplify the presentation of the evidence in a case 
<line: 16> involving complex issues,” as the case “never reached . . . highly technical and scientific issues. . 
<line: 17> . . ”  2016 WL 1161349 at *2.  But regardless, it found “the costs for a trial support team” not 
<line: 18> taxable “[i]n any event.”  Id.9  The use of trial technicians may have simplified the presentation 
<line: 19> of evidence, but this trial did not involve complex issues requiring such services.

<line: 34> distinguishable.  In that case, the court allowed trial support team costs to be taxed following a month-long patent

<line: 36> be taxed “where essential to a large or complex case.”  2007 WL 1852553, at *3.  This Court does not have a similar
