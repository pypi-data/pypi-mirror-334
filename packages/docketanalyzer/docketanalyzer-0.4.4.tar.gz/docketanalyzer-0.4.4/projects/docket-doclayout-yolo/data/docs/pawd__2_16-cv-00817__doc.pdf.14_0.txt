[TITLE]
<line: 22> ORDER OF COURT 

[TEXT]
<line: 24> AND NOW, this 18th day of October, 2016, upon consideration of Defendant Timothy Scott 
<line: 25> Kreger’s Motion to Dismiss, (Docket No. [10]), and Brief in Support, (Docket No. [11]), Plaintiff 
<line: 26> Ronald Leber’s Brief in Opposition, (Docket No. [13]), and after reviewing the allegations set forth 
<line: 27> in Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint, (Docket No. [4]), in light of the standards governing motions to 
<line: 28> dismiss set forth by the Supreme Court in Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), and 
<line: 29> Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009), and as articulated in Third Circuit precedent, see e.g., 
<line: 30> Connelly v. Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 790 (3d Cir. 2016), 

[TEXT]
<line: 32> IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant’s Motion [10] is GRANTED, IN PART, and 
<line: 33> DENIED, IN PART.  Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s § 1983 excessive force claim at 
<line: 34> Count I is denied as the Court finds that Plaintiff has set forth sufficient allegations to state a 
<line: 35> plausible claim that Officer Kreger’s actions in directing Plaintiff to remain in his car and thereafter 
<line: 36> intentionally slamming the car door, causing injury to his arm, constituted an actionable “seizure” 
<line: 37> under Third Circuit jurisprudence.  See United States v. Brown, 448 F.3d 239, 245 (3d Cir. 2006) 

[ABANDON]

<line: 2> (quoting California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 626, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991)) (“A 
<line: 3> seizure occurs when there is either (a) ‘a laying on of hands or application of physical force to 
<line: 4> restrain movement, even when it is ultimately unsuccessful,’ or (b) submission to ‘a show of 
<line: 5> authority.’  Put another way, when a seizure is effected by even ‘the slightest application of physical 
<line: 6> force,’ it is immaterial whether the suspect yields to that force.”); see also Couden v. Duffy, 446 F.3d 
<line: 7> 483, 496 (3d Cir. 2006) (citations omitted) (“The use of excessive force is itself an unlawful 
<line: 8> ‘seizure’ under the Fourth Amendment”).   Defendant’s Motion to dismiss Plaintiff's negligence 
<line: 9> claim at Count III is granted because the Court finds that Defendant is entitled to immunity from 
<line: 10> such claim under the Pennsylvania Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 8541 et seq., 
<line: 11> and that the sole exception raised by Plaintiff, the personal property exception, is not relevant to this 
<line: 12> case as the only claim for damages relates to injury to Plaintiff’s person and not to any damage 
<line: 13> caused to his personal property in possession of Defendant.  See Southersby Dev. Corp. v. Township 
<line: 14> of South Park, 2015 WL 1757767 at *9-11 (W.D. Pa. Apr. 15, 2015); see also 42 Pa.C.S. § 
<line: 15> 8542(b)(2) (“The only losses for which damages shall be recoverable under this paragraph are those 
<line: 16> property losses suffered with respect to the personal property in the possession or control of the local 
<line: 17> agency.”).   

[TITLE]
<line: 19> IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendant shall file his Answer to the remaining claims in 
<line: 20> Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint (Count I - § 1983 excessive force; and Count II – battery), by 
<line: 21> November 1, 2016.
