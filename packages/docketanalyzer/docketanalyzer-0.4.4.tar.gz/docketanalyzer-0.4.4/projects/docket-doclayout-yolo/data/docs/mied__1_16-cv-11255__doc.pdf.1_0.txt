[TITLE]
<line: 4> NATURE OF THE ACTION

[TEXT]
<line: 6> 1.
<line: 7> This is a shareholder's derivative action brought by Plaintiff on behalf
<line: 8> of Nominal Defendant, The Dow Chemical Company (Dow" or the "Company"),
<line: 9> against certain current and former officers and directors (the "Individual
<line: 10> Defendants") of the Company for breaches of their fiduciary duties and the failure
<line: 11> of their stewardship of the Company more generally. These claims are alleged
<line: 12> derivatively because Dow's Board of Directors, despite repeated written pre-suit
<line: 13> written demands, has not caused the Company to pursue such claims directly.

[TEXT]
<line: 15> 2.
<line: 16> Such conduct by the Individual Defendants, aided and abetted by.
<line: 17> Dow's purportedly independent auditors and legal counsel, resulted in, inter alia.
<line: 18> the Company's direct and indirect participation in and/or "cover-up' of Dow's
<line: 19> systemic violations of the federal antitrust laws and direct and indirect participation
<line: 20> in a conspiracy to fix, raise and/or stabilize prices for urethane chemicals over at
<line: 21> least a six-year period, as alleged and now proven in In Re: Urethane Antitrust
<line: 22> Litigation, MDL. No. 1616, Civil Action No. 04-1616 (D. Kan.), also referred to as
<line: 23> the polyether and polyol cases ("Urethane Litigation'). Such litigation resulted in a
<line: 24> final judgment on behalf of a Class of purchasers of such products against Dow for

<line: 5> provisionally settled for $835 million, subject to notice and approval by the Court.'

[TEXT]
<line: 7> 3.
<line: 8>  During and prior to the pendency of the Urethane Litigation described.
<line: 9> herein, Dow's Board and knowledgeable senior officers, out of misguided loyalty
<line: 10> to Defendant Andrew N. Liveris, Dow's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
<line: 11> conspired to acquiesce in and "cover up" massive, unjustified, multi-year misuse of
<line: 12> Dow's assets by him.?

<line: 16> 4.
<line: 17> This Court has jurisdiction over each of the Defendants pursuant to
<line: 18> diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. s 1332(a)(2) as Plaintiff, on the one hand,
<line: 19> and all the Defendants on the other, are citizens of different states, and the value of
<line: 20> the relief requested exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 5.
<line: 23> Venue is proper in this District because Dow is physically located.
<line: 24> within this District and because much of the wrongful conduct took place within

[ABANDON]
<line: 26> 1 Dow petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari during the 2014-5 term. The Petition
<line: 27> had been deferred for consideration during the Supreme Court's current term. The Company
<line: 28> never disclosed its total exposure to non-Class member claims arising from the price-fixing
<line: 29> conspiracy. On or after February 25, 2016, Dow requested that the Supreme Court defer
<line: 30> consideration of the Company's Petition for Certiorari pending consummation of the $835
<line: 31> million settlement with the Class..
<line: 32> 2 Although Defendant Liveris has repaid Dow a portion of the assets he misused, there

[TEXT]
<line: 34> has been no public record of the full amount thereof or, upon information and belief, any
<line: 35> complete accounting thereof.

<line: 5> THE URETHANE LITIGATION AND RELATED CONDUCT

[TEXT]
<line: 7> 34.  At all relevant times, Dow manufactured, sold and shipped substantial
<line: 8> quantities of "Polyether Polyol' products in a continuous and uninterrupted flow of
<line: 9> interstate commerce in the United States and elsewhere. The term "Polyether.
<line: 10> Polyol' products, as used herein, means polyether polyols, monomeric or
<line: 11> polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate ("MDI), toluene diisocyanate ("TDI),
<line: 12> and polyether polyol systems except any such systems that also contain polyester
<line: 13> polyols.

[TEXT]
<line: 15> 35.  Polyether Polyols are intermediate chemicals used in the manufacture
<line: 16> of rigid and flexible foams, among other applications. Polyether Polyols are
<line: 17> combined with isocyanates (usually either MDI or TDI) to produce polyurethane
<line: 18> polymers. Polyether Polyols constitute approximately 90 percent of the world's
<line: 19> polyol use.

[TEXT]
<line: 21> 36. MDI is a type of isocyanate used in combination with Polyether
<line: 22> Polyols as a raw material for the production of rigid insulation foams and structural.
<line: 23> foams, among other applications.

[TEXT]
<line: 25> 37. TDI is another type of isocyanate used in combination with Polyether.
<line: 26> Polyols as a raw material for the production of flexible foams for furniture,

<line: 4> Polyether Polyol) and a "B" side (an isocyanate, such as MDI or TDI) that, when
<line: 5> mixed together by the purchaser, react to form a polyurethane polymer. Due to
<line: 6> their different physical properties and applications, Polyether Polyols and polyester
<line: 7> polyols constitute separate and distinct markets. Important characteristics of the.
<line: 8> MDI, TDI and Polyether Polyols markets are such that facilitated anticompetitive
<line: 9> collusion among.Dow and its co-conspiritors and promoted successful effects of
<line: 10> that collusion; i.e. the inflation of prices above competitive levels..

<line: 13> As the Individual Defendants who held their respective positions with.
<line: 14> Dow before and during the pendency of the Urethane Litigation were aware or
<line: 15> should have been aware, due to both the limited number of common manufacturers
<line: 16> and a close correspondence in ownership of production of Polyether Polyol
<line: 17> products, the markets for these products are highly concentrated, with Dow and a.
<line: 18> few other manufacturers controlling 100% of the TDI and MDI markets and more
<line: 19> than 75 percent of the Polyether Polyols market. In addition, as such Individual.
<line: 20> Defendants knew or should have known, there are high barriers to entry to these.
<line: 21> markets due to environmental laws and regulations and the capital-intensive nature
<line: 22> of the business. Because of its high market share, Dow and the other manufactures.
<line: 23> named as defendants in the Urethane Litigation collectively were able to and did
<line: 24> exercise market power, including the ability to raise prices and erect barriers to
<line: 25> entry to the markets.

<line: 5> 39. Approximately 94% of all polyols used for flexible polyurethane foam
<line: 6> are comprised of Polyether Polyols. As a result, customers needing Polyether
<line: 7> Polyols do not switch suppliers because of the non-transitory, small but significant.
<line: 8> increase in the prices of Polyether Polyols, thereby setting favorable conditions for.
<line: 9> the successful implementation of the price-fixing agreement into which Dow was

<line: 13>  During the period of the price-fixing scheme in which Dow actively
<line: 14> participated, as alleged and ultimately proven in the Urethane Litigation, pricing.
<line: 15> for all three Polyether Polyol products was inter-related. On numerous occasions
<line: 16> during this period, as alleged and proven in the Urethane Litigation, price
<line: 17> increases in the same or similar amounts for Polyether Polyol products were
<line: 18> announced by Dow and its co-conspirators and/or became effective on the same
<line: 19> day or within a short period of time thereafter.

<line: 9> 47. Compounding the problem, the Individual Defendants (and.

<line: 11> valuable claims against the Company's outside legal counsel and outside auditor,

<line: 17> 61. The Company's Board established the Codes of Conduct and
<line: 18> published them extensively, despite knowing that they were not being and would
<line: 19> not be followed by the Individual Defendants. The Company's March 28, 2014.
<line: 20> Proxy Statement assured Dow's shareholders that:

[TEXT]
<line: 22> "All Directors, officers and employees. of Dow are
<line: 23> expected to be familiar with the Company's Code of
<line: 24> Business Conduct, and to apply it in the daily

<line: 26> Business Conduct is intended to focus employees,

[TEXT]
<line: 9> 63. Dow's Code of Conduct is published on Dow's website and
<line: 10> incorporated by reference in its Proxy Statements. The Code of Conduct describes.
<line: 11> the purported policies of conduct followed by Dow employees in conducting its
<line: 12> business operations.

[TEXT]
<line: 14> 64.  The Code of Conduct was approved by the Company's Board of
<line: 15> Directors which was directly responsible for approving and causing the publication.
<line: 16> of the misrepresentations set forth therein. Compliance with the Code of Conduct
<line: 17> is purportedly overseen by Dow's Office of Ethics and Compliance, with oversight
<line: 18> by the Company's General Counsel and the Audit Committee of the Board.

<line: 9>  As set forth herein, contrary to Defendant Liveris' representations and
<line: 10> assurances, as he was undoubtedly aware, the Company was engaged in a massive
<line: 11> price-fixing conspiracy in violation of antitrust laws, unethical ways of doing
<line: 12> business and securities fraud. All the while, during at least a decade, he was
<line: 13> misusing Dow assets for his personal benefit and/or wasting them profligately. The
<line: 14> Individual Defendants knowingly or recklessly permitted these abuses to occur, or
<line: 15> passively acquiesced therein and/or in the cover-up of such wrongdoing, with full
<line: 16> knowledge of the risks to Dow inherent in their deliberate strategy.

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 67. The Code of Conduct contains numerous representations specifically
<line: 19> relating to competition and antitrust, which the Individual Defendants knew, or
<line: 20> should have known were false, including the following:.

<line: 18> futile defense of the antitrust violations, deliberately failing to resolve those claims

<line: 11> such wrongdoing and the ensuing substantial liability. As such, they (as well as

<line: 24> not seriously considering the pursuit of any of Dow's claims but, rather, are proceeding in a

<line: 14> "likely to take several months to investigate' and on May 14, 2014, a final

[TITLE]
<line: 4> The Board's Responses to Plaintiff's Demands Were in Bad Faith

[TEXT]
<line: 6> 120. From the very first of the Board's responses to Plaintiff's demands, a
<line: 7> process was put in place, presumably engineered by Defendant Kalil and counsel
<line: 8> for the Board, to reject those demands (and those that followed the March 4, 2013
<line: 9> Demand Letter) and to employ such rejections as a foundation for an eventual
<line: 10> motion to dismiss.

[TEXT]
<line: 12> 121. Upon information and belief, although, according to the April 22,
<line: 13> 2013 letter from Ms. Wilson, the Board assigned to "the Governance Committee
<line: 14> of the Board, or any other action the responsibility to consider the facts and
<line: 15> circumstances surrounding the Demand Letter," its members almost totally
<line: 16> abdicated their responsibilities and left the investigation of Plaintiff's claims solely
<line: 17> in the hands of Mr. Nachbar and MNAT. In turn, such counsel intentionally
<line: 18> delayed even investigating Plaintiff's claims in a timely and competent manner by,
<line: 19> inter alia, not taking and preserving testimony from the most material of witnesses.
<line: 20> including members of Dow's Board to determine what they knew and when they.
<line: 21> knew it with regard to the underlying wrongdoing as alleged by Plaintiff..
<line: 22> Moreover, neither Mr. Nachbar, Ms. Wilson nor anyone else purportedly speaking.
<line: 23> on behalf of Dow has ever proferred any information that would demonstrate that
<line: 24> the Board or the Governance Committee was seriously considering whether Dow

<line: 5> would ever pursue any of the claims against the Individual Defendants or others as
<line: 6> identified by Plaintiff in his Demand Letters.

[TEXT]
<line: 8> 122.  In particular, integral to such strategy was: (a) the retention of Mr..
<line: 9> Nachbar and MNAT to represent the Governance Committee with their lack of
<line: 10> objectivity, independence and bias; (b) the denial to Plaintiff's counsel the
<line: 11> opportunity to address the Board and/or the Governance Committee with regard to
<line: 12> Plaintiff's demands; and (c) intentionally delaying taking testimony of material.
<line: 13> witnesses such as employees of Dow, while their memories were better than they.
<line: 14> would be today.

[TEXT]
<line: 16> 123. Upon information and belief, based in part upon his having a massive.
<line: 17> evidentiary record available to him, if it had been undertaken in good faith, Mr.
<line: 18> Nachbar's purported investigation should have long been completed.12 Together
<line: 19> with in-house and outside counsel, he has sought delay for no legitimate purpose.
<line: 20> Indeed, upon information and belief, Mr. Nachbar and his firm have aided and
<line: 21> abetted the individual defendants' wrongdoing and culpability and have worked
<line: 22> together in constructing a "whitewash' thereof. As such, given the three-year delay

[ABANDON]
<line: 24> 12 While it might be argued that while the Urethane Litigation appeals remained.
<line: 25> unresolved and Dow could not practically commence suit against those that caused and/or
<line: 26> participated in the underlying wrongdoing, there is no valid reason for a legitimate investigation
<line: 27> of Plaintiff's demands not to have been concluded when Mr. Nachbar predicted it could have
<line: 28> been concluded; i.e. the Summer of 2013. If the Governance Committee and/or the Board had
<line: 29> taken the position that Dow could not commenced suit, they could have rejected Plaintiff's
<line: 30>  demands but taken no position as to his pursuing the claims he made derivatively. They chose

<line: 4> in the Board's acting on Plaintiff's 2013 demands and the other reasons set forth

<line: 6> Board's bad faith in addressing Plaintiff's earlier demands and its deferral in
<line: 7> addressing the Liveris Demand Letter of October 31, 2015, the demands therein
<line: 8> have also been constructively rejected.

<line: 13> respect to the Company's claims against Dow's Trial Counsel and those implicated
<line: 14> in the price-fixing conspiracy that was the subject of the Urethane Litigation), such.
<line: 15> rejection was wrongful. Upon information and belief, the representation of the.
<line: 16> Company by Dow's Trial Counsel has ended more than two years ago and Dow's.
<line: 17> Board and Defendant have not sought tolling agreements with others whose
<line: 18> wrongdoing was addressed in Plaintiff's 2013 and 2014 Demand Letters. Further,
<line: 19> such rejection was recommended by the Governance Committee and its counsel
<line: 20> and, for the reasons stated above, participated in a process illegitimately developed

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 129. The members of Dow's Board have benefited from the wrongdoing.
<line: 5> alleged herein, and have engaged in conduct to preserve their positions of control
<line: 6> and the perquisites derived therefrom and to protect themselves from personal
<line: 7> liability for their acts of mismanagement and breaches of fiduciary duties. In their
<line: 8> own self-interest and out of loyalty to Defendant Liveris, even if they initially.
<line: 9> displayed some degree of independence in first considering Plaintiff's Demand
<line: 10> Letters, by their subsequent conduct and the conduct of the members of the
<line: 11> Governance Committee, they demonstrated their biases, lack of independence and
<line: 12> expectation that such demands would be rejected..

[TEXT]
<line: 14> 130. Moreover, in light of the Board members' personal culpability and
<line: 15> responsibility for the wrongful acts described herein, they are not disinterested
<line: 16> with respect to responding to Plaintiff's Demand Letters..

[TITLE]
<line: 18> DAMAGES SUFFERED BY DOW

[TEXT]
<line: 20> 131. The Board and senior management of Dow, including Defendant.
<line: 21> Liveris, in particular, failed to act in accordance with any legitimate exercise of.
<line: 22> business judgment and consistently with the fiduciary and other duties owed by.
<line: 23> them to Dow and its shareholders..

[TEXT]
<line: 25> 132. Dow's Directors utterly failed to implement validly functioning
<line: 26> reporting and controls to prevent Dow's serious and ongoing violations of antitrust
<line: 27> and trade regulation laws, rules and regulations. Thereafter, Dow's Directors.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> approved or acquiesced in a cover-up of the wrongdoing and an ill-considered
<line: 5> defense of such claims in the Urethane Litigation, as well as failed to properly
<line: 6> disclose and account for potential liability in connection with those proceedings.
<line: 7> Further, Dow's Board has failed to properly investigate and preserve (by way of
<line: 8> tolling agreements or otherwise) claims against other potentially responsible
<line: 9> persons, including but not limited to its outside auditors and Dow's Trial Counsel,
<line: 10> and utterly failed to take steps to make fundamental and meaningful changes in the.
<line: 11> Company's culture and corporate governance consistent with the fiduciary duties
<line: 12> of the members of Dow's Board.

[TEXT]
<line: 14> 133. As a result of the Individual Defendants' breaches of their fiduciary
<line: 15> duties as described herein, a judgment against Dow has been entered in excess of
<line: 16> $1 billion in connection with the Urethane Litigation, now settled for $835 million.
<line: 17> Moreover, if the Board does not put into place stringent antitrust compliance
<line: 18> procedures and implement them, Dow will continue to be exposed to substantial.
<line: 19> injury to its reputation and corporate goodwill, as well as possible governmental.
<line: 20> investigations and enforcement actions, potential criminal and civil liability,
<line: 21> including litigation.

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 134. The Company also has been caused to expend tens of millions of
<line: 24> dollars in the defense of the Urethane Litigation, which case should never have
<line: 25> proceeded to trial. Tellingly, Dow was the only named Defendant to take the case

<line: 5> to trial. As a direct consequence, Dow has incurred and will continue to incur.
<line: 6> substantial costs of defending against such litigation and ultimately resolving the
<line: 7> claims with shareholder funds, despite the fact that the underlying wrongdoing was.
<line: 8> and is the responsibility of the Individual Defendants named herein.

[TEXT]
<line: 10> 135. Dow has suffered and will continue to suffer substantial harm to an.
<line: 11> extent not yet fully capable of determination specifically because a full and public
<line: 12> accounting has never been made of Defendant Liveris' misuse of Dow's assets and
<line: 13> because the Individual Defendants have not disclosed publicly the Company's.
<line: 14> potential liability for antitrust law violations beyond those alleged in the Urethane
<line: 15> Litigation.

[TEXT]
<line: 17> 136. Because the members of the Company's Board suffer massive.
<line: 18> conflicts of interest due to their own personal culpability and their loyalty to
<line: 19> Defendant Liveris, they are not capable of advancing solely the Company's
<line: 20> interests as compared to their own. Based upon the facts and circumstances
<line: 21> described herein, it is clear that the members of Dow's Board have not dealt with
<line: 22> and are not dealing with Plaintiff's claims objectively, independently, and solely in
<line: 23> the Company's best interests.

[TEXT]
<line: 25> 137. As a result of the misconduct alleged herein, Dow has sustained and.
<line: 26> will continue to sustain significant damages, not only monetarily, but also to its

<line: 4> corporate image, reputation and goodwill. Should the Company's interests
<line: 5> continue to be represented as they are at present, Dow will be irreparably harmed.

[TITLE]
<line: 7> COUNT I
<line: 8> (Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Waste of Corporate Assets)

[TEXT]
<line: 10> 138. Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges each of the allegations set forth above
<line: 11> as if fully set forth herein.

[TEXT]
<line: 13> 139. The Individual Defendants all owed and/or owe fiduciary duties to the
<line: 14> Company and its shareholders to exercise candor, good faith and loyalty. By
<line: 15> reason of their fiduciary relationships, the Individual Defendants specifically owed.
<line: 16> and owe Dow the highest obligation of good faith and loyalty in the management
<line: 17> and administration of the affairs of the Company, including the oversight of Dow's.
<line: 18> compliance with federal and state antitrust and trade laws and regulations,
<line: 19> avoidance of conflicting loyalties and business relationships and compliance with
<line: 20> Dow's codes of conduct and tenets of corporate governance.

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 140. Each member of the Board had specific fiduciary duties as defined by
<line: 23> the Company's key corporate governance documents and principles, and as set
<line: 24> forth above, that, had they been discharged in accordance with the Board's.
<line: 25> obligations, would have either necessarily prevented the misconduct and
<line: 26> consequent harm to the Company, or would have uncovered and corrected such
<line: 27> misconduct, as alleged herein.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 141. The Individual Defendants consciously violated their corporate
<line: 5> responsibilities and intentionally breached their fiduciary duties to protect the.
<line: 6> rights and interests of Dow and its shareholders.

[TEXT]
<line: 8> 142. As a direct and proximate result of the Individual Defendants'
<line: 9> conscious failure to perform their fiduciary obligations, they have caused the.
<line: 10> Company substantial damages arising from their misconduct, to waste valuable.
<line: 11> corporate assets and to expend its corporate funds unnecessarily..

[TEXT]
<line: 13> 143. As a result of the misconduct alleged herein, the Individual
<line: 14> Defendants are personally liable to the Company in an amount that cannot
<line: 15> presently be determined..

<line: 20> 144. Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges each of the allegations set forth above
<line: 21> as if fully set forth herein..

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 145. Each of the Individual Defendants was and is being unjustly
<line: 24> compensated by Dow with compensation packages and otherwise despite the.
<line: 25> failure of their stewardship of the Company and their personal implication in the
<line: 26> wrongdoing set forth herein. This is particularly so as to Defendant Liveris who.
<line: 27> has personally been enriched unjustly as referred to above..

<line: 5> by the wrongdoing set forth in this Complaint should be required to account for.
<line: 6> and repay the Company therefor together with their earnings thereupon

<line: 8> COUNT III
<line: 9> (Breach of Duty of Loyalty)

[TEXT]
<line: 11> 147. Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges each of the allegations set forth above
<line: 12> as if fully set forth herein..

[TEXT]
<line: 14> 148. The conduct of Defendants has exposed Dow to significant damages
<line: 15> due to the members of the Board having first put their personal or contractual.
<line: 16> loyalties to Defendant Liveris before their obligations to put the Company's.
<line: 17> interests first and foremost..

[TEXT]
<line: 19> 149. By reason of the foregoing, Defendants have caused the Company to
<line: 20> suffer substantial harm.

[TITLE]
<line: 22> COUNT IV
<line: 23> (Breach of Duty of Candor)

[TEXT]
<line: 25> 150. Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges each of the allegations set forth above
<line: 26> as if fully set forth herein.

[TEXT]
<line: 28> 151. The Individual Defendants, during their respective tenures with the
<line: 29> Company, repeatedly concealed Dow's violations of the antitrust laws and risk of a
<line: 30> massive liability verdict in the Urethane Litigation as well the extent of Defendant.
<line: 31> Liveris' misuse of the Company's assets..

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 152. Such concealment of material facts from Dow's shareholders and the
<line: 5> public at large was a breach of the Individual Defendants' duty of candor owed to
<line: 6> Dow and its shareholders which, ultimately has case substantial damages to the
<line: 7> Company.
