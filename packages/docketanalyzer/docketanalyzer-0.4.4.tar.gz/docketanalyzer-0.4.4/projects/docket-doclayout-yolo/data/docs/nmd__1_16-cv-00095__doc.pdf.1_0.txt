[TITLE]
<line: 6> FILING COMPLAINT UNDER 42 U.S.C. $1983

[TEXT]
<line: 8> 1) The attached form is to assist you in the preparation of a complaint seeking relief under the
<line: 9> Civil Rights Act. In order for your complaint to be considered by the District Court, it must be
<line: 10> typewritten or legibly handwritten. All questions must be answered clearly and concisely in the.
<line: 11> appropriate space on the form. If necessary, you may use up to two additional pages (8 1/2" x.
<line: 12> 11") to complete part "C" of the complaint, making clear to which count the continued information
<line: 13>  applies. If there is more than one defendant, you should clearly indicate which of the acts alleged.
<line: 14> is attributable to each defendant.

[TITLE]
<line: 16> A. The Complaint

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 2) An original and one copy of the complaint must be provided for the court and one copy for.
<line: 19> each of the persons (defendants) you wish to sue. For example, if you name two defendants, you.
<line: 20> must file an original and three copies of the complaint. You should keep an additional copy of the
<line: 21> complaint for your own records. All copies of the complaint must be identical to the original.

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 3) Your complaint must be signed and include a declaration under penalty of perjury. You are
<line: 24> cautioned that any deliberate false statement of a material fact may serve as a basis for prosecution
<line: 25> and conviction for perjury. You should therefore exercise care to assure that all answers are true,
<line: 26> correct, and complete.

[TEXT]
<line: 28> 4) Under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. $1983, the court can grant relief only for wrongs which
<line: 29> amount to the denial of federal constitutional rights by a person acting under color of state law.
<line: 30> Your complaint can be brought in this court only if one or more of the named defendants is located
<line: 31> within this judicial district.

[TEXT]
<line: 33> 5) You must furnish an original and one copy of all papers, correspondence or other documents
<line: 34> (except the original complaint which requires an original and two copies) submitted to the court
<line: 35> for filing and consideration. In addition, you must furnish the opposing party or his attorney with
<line: 36> a copy of all such documents submitted to the court. Each original document (except the original
<line: 37> complaint) must include a certificate stating the date a copy of the document was mailed to the
<line: 38> opposing party or his attorney and the address to which it was mailed..

[TEXT]
<line: 40> A certificate of service may be in the following form:.

<line: 21> B.The Filing Fee and 28 U.S.C. s 1915

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 6) On and after May 1, 2013, filing a civil complaint in the federal district courts will require a
<line: 24> $350 filing fee, plus a $50 general administrative fee, for a total of $400. If you want to commence
<line: 25>  an action without prepayment of fees or security therefor, you must file a motion for leave to.
<line: 26> proceed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. $ 1915. Under  1915, you also must submit an affidavit and
<line: 27> a certified copy of your trust fund account statement (or institutional equivalent) for the six-month
<line: 28> period immediately preceding the filing of the complaint. The certified copy of the trust fund
<line: 29> account statement (or institutional equivalent) must be obtained from the appropriate official of
<line: 30> each penal institution at which you are or were confined during the six-month period. The court
<line: 31> will not consider the merits of the claims asserted in any complaint filed without either the $400.00
<line: 32> filing fees or a properly completed motion, affidavit and certified copy of your trust fund account.
<line: 33> statement (or institutional equivalent) as required by s 1915.

[TEXT]
<line: 35> 7) The motion and affidavit for leave to proceed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. s 1915 must be
<line: 36> typewritten or legibly handwritten. All questions must be answered clearly and concisely in the
<line: 37> appropriate space on the form. You must sign the motion and affidavit. You should exercise care
<line: 38> to assure that all answers are true, correct and complete.

[TEXT]
<line: 40> 8) If you are proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. $ 1915 and the motion, affidavit and certified
<line: 41> copy of your trust fund account statement (or institutional equivalent) are in proper form, you will
<line: 42> be ordered to pay within thirty days an initial partial filing fee in an amount to be determined by
<line: 43> the court pursuant to $ 1915(b)(1). The court will not review the merits of your complaint until
<line: 44> the initial partial filing fee is paid. If you fail to pay the initial partial filing fee within thirty days
<line: 45> or fail to show that you have no assets and no means by which to pay the initial partial filing fee,
<line: 46> the complaint will be dismissed without prejudice. If the initial partial filing fee is paid within
<line: 47> thirty days, the court will review the complaint pursuant to $ 1915(e)(2)(B) to determine if it is
<line: 48> frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary
<line: 49> relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief.

[TEXT]
<line: 51> 9) You are reminded that, even if you are allowed to proceed pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1915, you
<line: 52> must pay the full filing fees as required by law, i.e., $400.00. It is your responsibility to ensure
<line: 53> that monthly payments are sent to the court as required by $ 1915(b)(2) until the filing fee is paid
<line: 54> in full. It is your responsibility to have the institution where you are confined forward the
<line: 55> payments from your trust fund account to the clerk of the court each time the amount in your

<line: 4> account exceeds $10.00. The complaint may be dismissed at any point if you fail to make the.
