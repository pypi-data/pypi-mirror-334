[TEXT]
<line: 17> The Court had previously stayed this case because Defendants' insurer was in liquidation
<line: 18> and there was a state court order staying all matters on behalf of the insurance company's
<line: 19> insureds. (Dkt. No. 10.) Plaintiff's counsel now informs the Court that the state court stay has
<line: 20> been lifted. (Dkt. No. 13.)

[TEXT]
<line: 22> Accordingly, the stay of this case is lifted. Plaintiff is directed to serve Defendants
<line: 23> within 30 days from the date of this order. Defendants are directed to file an appearance within
<line: 24> 14 days from the date of service. The parties are further directed to file a joint letter to the Court
<line: 25> within 30 days from the date of service, outlining their proposals on how to proceed with this
<line: 26> action.

[TEXT]
<line: 28> The Clerk of Court is directed to lift the stay and to reinstate this case.
<line: 29> SO ORDERED.
