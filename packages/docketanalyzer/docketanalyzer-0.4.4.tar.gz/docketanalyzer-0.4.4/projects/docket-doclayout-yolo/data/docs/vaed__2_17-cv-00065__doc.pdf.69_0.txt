<line: 3> BACKGROUND

[TEXT]
<line: 5> This case is an appeal from an administrative hearing conducted by the Virginia
<line: 6> Department of Education pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20
<line: 7> U.S.C.  1400 et seq. See generally Doc. 1 ("Compl."). M.N. is a special education student in
<line: 8> Virginia Beach's schools. Doc. 53 at 2. In 2014-2015, her family moved to the city of Virginia
<line: 9> Beach, bringing along an individualized education program ("IEp") from Fairfax County Public
<line: 10> Schools. See Ex. B887-919 (Doc. 28 at 68-100). She has multiple issues that affect her ability
<line: 11> to learn, including the following:

[TEXT]
<line: 13> Right Hemiplegia (paralysis of the right side of the body that is a symptom
<line: 14> of an attack on the left side of the brain);
<line: 15> Cerebral Palsy (causes impaired movement and possibly chronic fatigue
<line: 16> and slow performance);
<line: 17> Neurodevelopmental disorders (including deficits in executive
<line: 18> functioning, visual figure-ground, sensory processing secondary to brain
<line: 19> hemorrhaging);
<line: 20> Visual tracking problems (causes eye movements to be slow and/or
<line: 21> inaccurate);
<line: 22> Language disorder (trouble understanding others or sharing thoughts,.
<line: 23> ideas and feelings);
<line: 24> Inattentive type of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (a
<line: 25> brain disorder marked by an ongoing pattern of inattention and/or.
<line: 26> hyperactivity that interferes with functioning or development);.
<line: 27> Developmental coordination disorder (a chronic neurological disorder that.
<line: 28> can affect planning of movements and coordination as a result of brain.
<line: 29> messages not being accurately transmitted to the body);
<line: 30> Learning disorder (LD) (problems that affect the brain's ability to receive,
<line: 31> process, analyze, or store information making it more difficult to learn);
<line: 32> Deficits in higher order reading comprehension (deficits in word reading.
<line: 33> accuracy and/or reading comprehension);
<line: 34> Voice projection disorder or Dysphonia (usually characterized by
<line: 35> hoarseness, vocal fatigue, raspiness, periodic loss of voice, or
<line: 36> inappropriate pitch);
<line: 37> Deficits in written expression (generally a combination of difficulties in
<line: 38> the individual's ability to compose written texts evidenced by grammatical
<line: 39> or punctuation errors within sentences, poor paragraph organization,
<line: 40> multiple spelling errors, and/or poor handwriting skills);

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Deficits in arithmetic calculation (unable to memorize many basic math
<line: 3> facts and/or exhibits weak verbal skills for monitoring the steps of.
<line: 4> complex calculations);
<line: 5> Generalized anxiety disorder (characterized by excessive, exaggerated.
<line: 6> anxiety and worry about everyday life events with no obvious reasons for
<line: 7> worry);
<line: 8> Obsessive compulsive disorder (OcD) (uncontrollable, reoccurring
<line: 9> thoughts 'obsessions' and behaviors 'compulsions' that create the urge to.
<line: 10> repeat actions over and over); and.
<line: 11> Brain Injury (In case, a loss of volume on the left side of her brain that
<line: 12> increases her risk for seizures)..

<line: 14> Doc. 1-1 ("Hearing Officer's Decision"' or "Decision") at 7-8.

[TEXT]
<line: 16> The underlying IDEA proceeding resulted from M.N.'s parents' decision to enroll her in
<line: 17> Chesapeake Bay Academy ("CBA'), a private school, after determining that Virginia Beach
<line: 18> failed to provide her with a free appropriate public education (*FAPE'). Id. at 10-12. When
<line: 19> M.N. moved to the city of Virginia Beach, Virginia Beach represented that it could implement
<line: 20> the Fairfax IEP. See Ex. B919 (Doc. 28 at 100). In September 2014, M.N. enrolled in fifth
<line: 21> grade at Red Mill Elementary School ("Red Mill') in Virginia Beach. Doc. 53 at 4; Doc. 55 at 4;
<line: 22> see also, e.g., Ex. B001 (Doc. 22 at 2) (listing Red Mill as the school). After a meeting on
<line: 23> October 1, 2014, to address parental concerns, the IEP team at Red Mill agreed on an addendum
<line: 24> to the IEP. See Ex. B130 (Doc. 23 at 10). That same month, one of M.N.'s teachers, Julie
<line: 25> Harrison ("Mrs. Harrison'), was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan. See Ex. 23.061-
<line: 26> 062 (Doc. 31 at 61-62). Virginia Beach subsequently removed her from her teaching position in
<line: 27> December 2014. Decision at 15; see also, e.g., Ex. 41.012 n.2 (Doc. 40 at 25).

[TEXT]
<line: 29> Throughout 2014--2015, M.N.'s IEP team met several times to craft an IEP for PAMS but
<line: 30> was unsuccessful in agreeing on a new IEP. These meetings occurred on December 8, 2014, and
<line: 31> several dates in 2015: January 22, February 5, March 23, March 30, April 2, and June 17, 2015.
<line: 32> See Ex. B031 (Doc. 22 at 32); Ex. A031 (Doc. 21 at 36). During this time, M.N.'s parents also

[TEXT]
<line: 2> paid for tutoring and social skills classes to supplement M.N.'s education at Red Mill. See Ex.
<line: 3> B309-21 (Doc. 24 at 92-98; Doc. 25 at 1-6). On August 10, 2015, M.N.'s parents timely
<line: 4> noticed Virginia Beach of their intent to unilaterally place M.N. at CBA, a private school, should
<line: 5> Virginia Beach not agree to private day placement. Ex. 41.005-006 (Doc. 40 at 18-19). On.
<line: 6> August 25, 2015, Virginia Beach rejected the parents' request for private day placement. Ex.
<line: 7> B057-58 (Doc. 22 at 58-59).

[TEXT]
<line: 9> During 2015-2016, Virginia Beach and M.N.'s parents agreed on multiple evaluations of
<line: 10> M.N. in support of ongoing IEP discussion, but they were still unable to reach agreement on a
<line: 11> new IEP despite numerous additional meetings. Agreed evaluation topics included occupational
<line: 12> therapy, physical therapy, sociocultural evaluation, and updated medical, educational, and
<line: 13> observational reports. Ex. B186 (Doc. 23 at 65). The parents also paid for multiple independent
<line: 14> evaluations in those categories in addition to the school's evaluations. See, e.g., Ex. C172-204,
<line: 15> C217-229 (Doc. 36 at 1-33, 46-58). After all of those evaluations and additional IEP meetings,
<line: 16> the last proposed IEP for this school year was the one that Virginia Beach dated June 9, 2016,
<line: 17> and offered to M.N.'s parents on June 23, 2016. Trial Tr. (Doc. 42) (hereinafter "Tr.") at 5:19

[TEXT]
<line: 20> On July 11, 2016, M.N.'s parents filed a due process complaint pursuant to the IDEA
<line: 21> with the Virginia Department of Education. Decision at 2. The Virginia Department of
<line: 22> Education appointed a Hearing Officer, who heard the case on September 12-14, 2016. Id. The
<line: 23> Parties presented four (4) issues to the administrative hearing officer:.

[TEXT]
<line: 25> Whether or not the local education agency (LEA) has properly implemented an.
<line: 26> individual educational program (IEP) for the student.
<line: 27> Whether or not the LEA is providing the student with a free appropriate public
<line: 28> education (FAPE).
<line: 29> Whether or not the LEA provided sufficient educational evaluations to formulate
<line: 30> an appropriate IEP within a reasonable time.

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Whether or not private day placement is required for the student to receive a
<line: 3> FAPE.

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Id. at 12. The Hearing Officer entered her decision in the matter on October 30, 2016. Id. at 30.
<line: 6> She made four (4) key findings: that Virginia Beach had not properly implemented an IEP for
<line: 7> M.N., that Virginia Beach failed to offer FAPE to M.N., that Virginia Beach provided sufficient
<line: 8> evaluations to form an IEP within a reasonable time, and that private day placement was required
<line: 9> for 2015-2016 and for 2016-2017. See generally id. She ordered reimbursement for two (2)
<line: 10> years of private day placement, denied reimbursement for tutoring, and deferred any decision on
<line: 11> attorneys' fees to a reviewing court on the ground that she lacked statutory authority to grant
<line: 12> such an award. See id. at 29-30.

[TEXT]
<line: 14> On January 27, 2017, M.N. timely filed a complaint with this Court seeking an award of
<line: 15> attorneys' fees for prevailing in an IDEA due process hearing. Doc. 1. On January 30, 2017,
<line: 16> Virginia Beach filed a separate action seeking reversal of the Hearing Officer's decisions in
<line: 17> favor of M.N. No. 2:17cv66, Doc. 1 ("VB Counterclaim'). On May 22, 2017, M.N. filed an
<line: 18> Amended Complaint in this action with leave of Court. Doc. 11. M.N. filed a counterclaim in
<line: 19> the companion action seeking the tutoring and social skills fees denied by the Hearing Officer.

[TEXT]
<line: 22> The Court entered a combined scheduling Order for both actions on June 16, 2017
<line: 23> directing the Parties to file cross-motions for summary judgment on the administrative record,?.

[ABANDON]
<line: 25> motions in such actions are not properly captioned as summary judgment motions. See, e.g., Cty. Sch. Bd. of
<line: 26> Henrico Cty., Virginia y. Z.P. ex rel. R.P., 399 F.3d 298, 309 (4th Cir. 2005). It has inconsistently expressed this
<line: 27> view, though, at times affirming the practice while noting IDEA specific rules. See, e.g., Schaffer ex rel. Schaffer v.
<line: 28> Weast, 554 F.3d 470, 479 (4th Cir. 2009); A.B. ex rel. D.B. v. Lawson, 354 F.3d 315, 324-25 (4th Cir. 2004). It has
<line: 29> yet to resolve this inconsistency, as some panels have observed in commenting on the relevant standard of review.
<line: 30> See O.S. v. Fairfax Cty. Sch. Bd., 804 F.3d 354, 360 n.2 (4th Cir. 2015). Because this Court must generally give a
<line: 31> type of deference to the factual findings of the underlying administrative decision, subject to a limited exception,
<line: 32> these proceedings are very similar to administrative appeals, even if they are not exactly the same. Thus, this

<line: 10> LEGAL STANDARD

[TEXT]
<line: 12> The IDEA offers federal funding to states in exchange for their agreement to educate.
<line: 13> disabled students in accordance with certain statutory criteria. See 20 U.S.C.  1411. One of
<line: 14> those criteria is that the state provide a "free appropriate public education" (FAPE") to all
<line: 15> disabled students residing in the state. See id.  1412(a)(1). The statute defines FAPE as
<line: 16> follows:

[TEXT]
<line: 18> special education and related services that--
<line: 19> (A) have been provided at public expense, under public supervision and direction,.
<line: 20> and without charge;.
<line: 21> (B) meet the standards of the State educational agency;.
<line: 22> (C) include an appropriate preschool, elementary school, or secondary school.
<line: 23> education in the State involved; and.
<line: 24> (D) are provided in conformity with the individualized education program
<line: 25> required under section 1414(d) of this title.

[TEXT]
<line: 27> Id.  1401(9). The chapter further states that "[t]he term *individualized education program' or
<line: 28> 'IEP' means a written statement for each child with a disability that is developed, reviewed, and
<line: 29> revised in accordance with this section and that includes' several categories of information. Id.
<line: 30>  1414(a)(5)(1)(A). While it contains a lengthy list of requirements, it generally provides that
<line: 31> "[a]n appropriate IEP must contain statements concerning a disabled child's level of functioning,.
<line: 32> set forth measurable annual achievement goals, describe the services to be provided, and

[ABANDON]
<line: 34> District has generally labelled the motions as ones for summary judgment while acknowledging the applicable IDEA

[TEXT]
<line: 5> The IDEA further provides that any party may present a due process complaint to the.
<line: 6> appropriate state or local education agency "with respect to any matter relating to the
<line: 7> identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a free.

<line: 11> due process complaint. Id.  1415(i)(2).

<line: 13> When reviewing IDEA administrative proceedings, a court applies "modified de novo
<line: 14> review, giving due weight to the underlying administrative proceedings." O.S., 804 F.3d at 360
<line: 15> (quoting M.S. ex rel. Simchick y. Fairfax Cty. Sch. Bd., 553 F.3d 315, 323 (4th Cir. 2009))
<line: 16> (internal quotation marks omitted). Due weight in this context means that "findings of fact made
<line: 17> in administrative proceedings are considered to be prima facie correct, and if a reviewing court.
<line: 18> fails to adhere to them, it is obliged to explain why." MM, 303 F.3d at 531 (citing Doyle v.
<line: 19> Arlington County Sch. Bd., 953 F.2d 100, 103 (4th Cir. 1991)). Credibility determinations, both
<line: 20> explicit and implicit, are part of the findings that a reviewing court must afford due weight. Z.P.,
<line: 21> 399 F.3d at 306-07. Deference does not apply if the findings are not "regularly made." Id. at
<line: 22> 305 (citing Doyle, 953 F.2d at 105). "Factual findings are not 'regularly made' if they are
<line: 23> reached through a process that is 'far from the accepted norm of a fact-finding process." Id.

<line: 9>  ANALYSIS

[TEXT]
<line: 11> The primary issue in this case is whether M.N.'s parents properly removed her from.
<line: 12> Virginia Beach public schools to a private school. "When a state receiving IDEA funding fails
<line: 13> to provide a FAPE, the child's parent may remove the child to a private school and then seek
<line: 14> tuition reimbursement from the state." A.K., 484 F.3d at 679 (quoting A.B., 354 F.3d at 320).
<line: 15> "The parent may recover if (1) the proposed IEP was inadequate to offer the child a FAPE and
<line: 16> (2) the private education services obtained by the parents were appropriate to the child's needs."
<line: 17> Id. (quoting same).

[TEXT]
<line: 19> The underlying issue in this case is that the Parties disagree about whether to trust
<line: 20> Virginia Beach's staff, and they engage in many different arguments that are proxy fights about
<line: 21> that issue. These arguments began when Virginia Beach failed to provide M.N. a FAPE in
<line: 22> 2014-2015, as explained infra. It did not admit that failure, and it crafted IEPs in the belief that
<line: 23> its staff at another school would remedy any deficiencies going forward. The parents do not trust
<line: 24> Virginia Beach and want a detailed IEP to fix implementation problems. While the Court does
<line: 25> not pass judgment on whether Virginia Beach could ever provide a FAPE, the Court agrees with
<line: 26> the Hearing Officer that Virginia Beach at least failed to offer FAPE in its last proposed IEPs for

[ABANDON]
<line: 28> 3 For example, one frequent fight in the records is over whether M.N. needs social skills goals. Virginia Beach
<line: 29> insists that their social skills lunchtime program at PAMS is enough and that no literal goals are needed, while
<line: 30> M.N.'s parents repeatedly insist that explicit written goals are needed. Neither Party appears to have a good reason
<line: 31> why the other Party's idea is unacceptable beyond their respective positions on trusting Virginia Beach's staff.

[TEXT]
<line: 2> 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 by promoting M.N. too quickly and by offering insufficient detail,
<line: 3> respectively, as explained in further detail infra.

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Virginia Beach challenges the Hearing Officer's decision on two (2) grounds: that the
<line: 6> Hearing Officer failed to give due deference to professional educators, and that several of the
<line: 7> Hearing Officer's findings are not supported by the evidence. See VB Counterclaim  51-56.
<line: 8> In its Motion for Summary Judgment, Virginia Beach expands the first ground for relief to
<line: 9> encompass five (5) different reasons why the Hearing Officer's findings failed to comport with
<line: 10> legal standards and are not entitled to deference, and it reduces the second ground to dispute two
<line: 11> (2) specific findings: that the 2014--2015 "stay-put' was not properly implemented, and that the
<line: 12> last proposed IEP did not offer M.N. a FAPE. See generally Doc. 55. The incongruity between
<line: 13> the two (2) documents leaves Virginia Beach's arguments open to some interpretation. For
<line: 14> example, Virginia Beach's Counterclaim challenges the finding that CBA could provide M.N. a
<line: 15> FAPE, but its Motion for Summary Judgment only challenges the legal standard applied to that
<line: 16> finding and never challenges the finding itself. Compare VB Counterclaim  56(r), (t) with
<line: 17> Doc. 55 at 24. Thus, the Court attempts to organize and address Virginia Beach's actual
<line: 18> challenges as best as is cognizable based on the briefing.4

[TITLE]
<line: 20> A.
<line: 21> Whether the Hearing Officer's Findings Are Entitled to Deference

[TEXT]
<line: 23> Virginia Beach misunderstands this Circuit's law on deference in IDEA proceedings, and
<line: 24> that mistake undermines its arguments. As explained supra, a hearing officer's findings are
<line: 25> entitled to deference when "regularly made." See supra Part II. Instead of citing that body of

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 4 M.N. seems to recognize the incongruence between the two (2) documents as well, observing that Virginia Beach's
<line: 28> Motion "raise[s] new claims that were not a part of the original appeal of the Special Education Due Process
<line: 29> Hearing Officer's decision." Doc. 59 at 10. In all fairness to Virginia Beach, many of its "new' arguments are not
<line: 30> truly new claims, as they merely affect the level of deference this Court applies in considering the Hearing Officer's
<line: 31> factual findings. See, e.g., Doc. 55 at 16-17, 19-20 (contesting the Hearing Officer's methodology for assessing
<line: 32> FAPE); see also VB Counterclaim  56(n), (p), (s), (t) (contesting whether VB offered a FAPE more broadly). M.N.
<line: 33> attempts to address the arguments raised in total between the two (2) incongruent documents notwithstanding her
<line: 34> objection, and thus, the Court has full briefing before it on all relevant issues.

[TEXT]
<line: 2> case law, Virginia Beach cites A.K., 484 F.3d at 67980 (citing Z.P., 399 F.3d at 309) for the
<line: 3> proposition that "[a] hearing officer's finding regarding the sufficiency of an IEP 'is not entitled.
<line: 4> to deference to the extent that it is based upon application of an incorrect legal standard.'" Doc.
<line: 5> 55 at 15 (quoting A.K., 484 F.3d at 679-80). That selective quoting of A.K. led Virginia Beach
<line: 6> to an incorrect reading of the case law. A.K. stands for the proposition that a district court's
<line: 7> finding is not entitled to deference from appellate courts when based on the incorrect legal
<line: 8> standard. See A.K., 494 F.3d at 679-80 (discussing the standard of review for a district court's
<line: 9> order). This distinction matters because the Fourth Circuit applies a different standard of review
<line: 10> to a Hearing Officer's decision than it applies to a District Court's opinion. See J.P., 516 F.3d at
<line: 11> 262. For example, the Fourth Circuit requires detailed analysis from a District Court while
<line: 12> allowing "bare-boned" findings from a Hearing Officer to suffice. Id. If a Hearing Officer fails
<line: 13> to apply the correct legal standard, and that failure leaves the record devoid of any findings that
<line: 14> would allow a reviewing court to reach a conclusion on the correct legal standard, then the
<line: 15> Fourth Circuit requires remand to the Hearing Officer, not simply assessment without deference.
<line: 16> JH, 326 F.3d at 568; see also J.P., 516 F.3d at 262 n.3 (elaborating on the Fourth Circuit's
<line: 17> understanding of the requirements for remand). Because Virginia Beach's arguments do not

<line: 24>  Separate Consideration of Each School Year

<line: 26> Two (2) of Virginia Beach's arguments address essentially the same issue: whether the
<line: 27> Hearing Officer separately considered 2014-2015, 2015-2016, and 2016-2017. See Doc. 55 at

[TEXT]
<line: 2> 16-17, 19-20. "[T]he finding of an invalid IEP for a particular school year is a necessary
<line: 3> precursor to reimbursement for a parental placement." M.S., 553 F.3d at 324.

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Virginia Beach rightly criticizes deficiencies in the Hearing Officer's decision. The
<line: 6> Hearing Officer began with the accurate statement that the last proposed IEP was the IEP offered
<line: 7> on June 23, 2016, as corrected on July 7, 2016. Decision at 12. She then stated that the last.
<line: 8> detailed statement of disagreement occurred on May 17, 2015, but cited to a different statement
<line: 9> from March 2015. See id. at 11 (citing Ex. 12.001); see also Ex. 12.001 (Doc. 30 at 1) (the
<line: 10> statement from March 2015 listing concerns with the draft IEP); Ex. B734 (Doc. 27 at 6) (the.
<line: 11> statement of disagreement from May 17, 2015). She also described the March 2015 statement as.
<line: 12> a twenty (20) page commentary on the last proposed IEP, which was incorrect for two (2)
<line: 13> reasons: the exhibit encompassed two (2) different statements, and both of them predated the last
<line: 14> proposed IEP by over a year. See Decision at 17; see also Ex. 12.001-020 (Doc. 30 at 1-20).
<line: 15> She then made her findings regarding the "last proposed IEP" without any dates or citations,
<line: 16> leaving an open question of whether she understood that the cited statements did not apply to the
<line: 17> last proposed IEP. Decision at 20. She also considered implementation of the stay-put IEP as.
<line: 18> part of determining the sufficiency of the last proposed IEP, which was not proper at all. See id.
<line: 19> (offering that errant analysis); see also M.S., 553 F.3d at 324 (requiring that IEP findings be
<line: 20> particularized by school year). The Hearing Officer's decision is a bit confusing in its
<line: 21> description of important terms and thus requires some interpretation.

[TEXT]
<line: 23> Although these deficiencies are concerning, they do not amount to errors requiring
<line: 24> remand. The harsh reading by Virginia Beach is that the Hearing Officer failed to consider any
<line: 25> draft IEPs except the ones criticized in Ex. 12.001-020, while the charitable reading by M.N. is
<line: 26> that the Hearing Officer found that the same violations afflicted the January 2015 IEP and all

[ABANDON]
<line: 28> 11

[TEXT]
<line: 2> subsequent ones. A hearing officer cannot fail to consider each year's IEPs, but a hearing officer
<line: 3> may criticize all of them with the same violations. See, e.g., M.S., 553 F.3d at 323 (observing,
<line: 4> without comment, that a hearing officer found three (3) IEPs invalid for the same reasons). The
<line: 5> only limit is that a hearing officer must review each IEP based on evidence that arose before the
<line: 6> creation of that IEP. See Schaffer, 554 F.3d at 477 (emphasizing that review of an IEP is
<line: 7> prospective, not retrospective). In view of that standard, M.N.'s reading is the more accurate
<line: 8> interpretation of the decision in this case. The Hearing Officer at one point referred to all of the
<line: 9> draft IEPs cumulatively:

[TEXT]
<line: 11> The IEPs proposed by VBCPS dropped eight goals and sixteen accommodations
<line: 12> that the parents' contend [M.N.] continued to need. (Tr. pg. 405) As previously
<line: 13> mentioned, the IEP moved occupational therapy and physical therapy from the
<line: 14> services category to accommodations. (Tr. pg. 396) When confronted, VBCPS
<line: 15> justified the OT and PT changes by claiming that is the way it is routinely done in
<line: 16> VBCPS.

[TEXT]
<line: 18> Decision at 18-19. She also concluded that the IEP team failed to propose goals that would
<line: 19> remedy M.N.'s below grade level performance:

[TEXT]
<line: 21> If a child, such as [M.N.,] is performing below grade level, that child needs to.
<line: 22> receive specialized instruction. It is the responsibility of the IEP team to develop
<line: 23> annual goals to close the gap. This did not occur..

[TEXT]
<line: 25> Decision at 20.  She then offered explicit findings on the "last proposed IEp" to determine
<line: 26> whether Virginia Beach offered FAPE. Id. at 20, 27. It seems that she intended her criticisms of
<line: 27> the last proposed IEP to be criticisms of all draft IEPs up to and including the last proposed one.
<line: 28> Because that apparent approach is an appropriate approach, any errors under this topic are not
<line: 29> severe enough to deprive this Court of reviewable findings..

<line: 32> Procedural Violations

[TEXT]
<line: 34> Virginia Beach's next challenge concerns whether the Hearing Officer improperly relied
<line: 35> on procedural violations for finding a denial of FAPE. Doc. 55 at 17-19. "[A]n alleged

[ABANDON]
<line: 37> 12

[TEXT]
<line: 2> procedural violation of the IDEA, without more, is insufficient to show a school failed to provide
<line: 3> a child with FAPE." Bobby v. Sch. Bd. of City of Norfolk, No. 2:13cv714, 2014 WL 3101927,
<line: 4> at *8 (E.D. Va. July 7, 2014). "Rather, when procedural violations are alleged, they 'must
<line: 5> actually interfere with the provision of a FAPE to that child.'" Id. (quoting DiBuo ex rel. DiBuo
<line: 6> v. Bd. of Educ. of Worcester Cnty., 309 F.3d 184, 190 (4th Cir. 2002)). The Hearing Officer's
<line: 7> findings at issue stated as follows:

[TEXT]
<line: 9> I FIND that the VBCPS' last proposed IEP failed to meet [M.N.'s] complex
<line: 10> academic and functional needs by rejecting parental concerns, minimizing the.
<line: 11> severity of [M.N.'s] disabilities, providing only cursory review of the results of.
<line: 12> independent evaluations; and by failing to include agreed-upon revisions to the.
<line: 13> IEP drafts.

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Decision at 20. Virginia Beach argues that some of these findings are not even procedural
<line: 16> violations, as it is not required to adopt all of the parents' suggestions. Doc. 55 at 18-19. It
<line: 17> further insists that to the extent it committed any procedural violations, none led to the denial of.
<line: 18> FAPE in the substance of the IEPs for 2015-2016 and for 2016-2017. Id.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Virginia Beach has not raised enough of a flaw to require remand. It is true that
<line: 21> "rejecting parental concerns," "providing only cursory review of the results of independent
<line: 22> evaluations," and "failing to include agreed-upon revisions to the IEP drafts' are procedural
<line: 23> errors, and the Hearing Officer does not offer any analysis as to why those violations led to
<line: 24> denial of FAPE here. It is less clear that "minimizing the severity of [M.N.'s] disabilities" is
<line: 25> procedural, as an IEP that provides services for a lower level of disability would fail to provide
<line: 26> FAPE. Virginia Beach offers no analysis directed at that particular finding, instead taking the
<line: 27> view that all of the Hearing Officer's findings implemented a parental veto. See Doc. 55 at 18.
<line: 28> This argument is analogous to the previous one because Virginia Beach takes a dim view of the
<line: 29> Hearing Officer's decision, believing that she favored the parents and did not understand the

[ABANDON]
<line: 31> 13

[TEXT]
<line: 2> substance at issue. See id. Because the Court believes that the better reading of the Hearing
<line: 3> Officer's decision is that she criticized all of the draft IEPs' failure to address M.N.'s needs, the
<line: 4> Court further FINDS that "minimizing the severity of [M.N.'s] disabilities" is a substantive
<line: 5> criticism similar to other findings in the decision. Thus, any errors under this topic are not
<line: 6> severe enough to deprive this Court of reviewable findings.

[TITLE]
<line: 8> iii
<line: 9> Deference to Educators

[TEXT]
<line: 11> Virginia Beach contends that the Hearing Officer failed to give the required deference to
<line: 12> professional educators in her findings. The Supreme Court has repeatedly cautioned that courts
<line: 13> should not "substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school
<line: 14> authorities which they review." Endrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cty. Sch. Dist. RE-1.
<line: 15> 137 S. Ct. 988, 1001 (2017); Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist., Westchester
<line: 16> Cty. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 206 (1982). The Fourth Circuit has extended this deference to the
<line: 17> administrative proceedings. Z.P., 399 F.3d at 307 ("We recognize, of course, that at all levels of
<line: 18> an IDEA proceeding, the opinions of the professional educators are entitled to respect."). This
<line: 19> deference does not mean that a hearing officer must decide all factual disputes in favor of the
<line: 20> school. See id. For example, in Z.P., the Fourth Circuit explained that the hearing officer was
<line: 21> obligated to accept the educators' testimony regarding the effectiveness of their own program but
<line: 22> was not obligated to accept testimony regarding the propriety of their program for the particular
<line: 23> student at issue. See id. at 308. It observed that "[t]o conclude that the hearing officer erred
<line: 24> simply because he did not accept the testimony of the School Board's witnesses, an argument
<line: 25> that the School Board comes very close to making, would render meaningless the due process
<line: 26> rights guaranteed to parents by the IDEA." Id. at 307 (citing School Bd. v. Malone, 762 F.2d
<line: 27> 1210, 1217 (4th Cir. 1985))

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> 14

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Virginia Beach raises three (3) issues that it believes demonstrate no deference. Doc. 55
<line: 3> at 20-23. First, it argues that the Hearing Officer improperly credited the testimony of the
<line: 4> parents alone over the testimony of special education case manager Nikki Moore ("Ms. Moore')
<line: 5> in assessing the adequacy of goals and accommodations in draft IEPs. Id. at 21-22. Second, it
<line: 6> contends that the Hearing Officer failed to address the credibility of all of the relevant school
<line: 7> witnesses when deciding whether M.N. needed smaller class size or a private school placement.
<line: 8> Id. at 22-23. Third, it criticizes the findings about whether M.N. could be heard at PAMS as
<line: 9> substituting the Hearing Officer's own observations for the testimony of the school officials. Id.
<line: 10> at 23.

[TEXT]
<line: 12> This Court's deference to the Hearing Officer's credibility determinations undermines
<line: 13> Virginia Beach's arguments here. As M.N. recognizes, this Court must defer both to explicit and
<line: 14> implicit credibility determinations. See id. at 17 (quoting Z.P., 399 F.3d at 307). Virginia Beach
<line: 15> does not offer any reasonable basis for the Court to reverse those determinations

[TEXT]
<line: 17> For the issue of goals and accommodations, the Parties are reprising their familiar
<line: 18> arguments of whether the Hearing Officer considered the substance of the IEPs. M.N.'s expert
<line: 19> witnesses criticized the adequacy of the goals and accommodations. See, e.g., Tr. at 63:2-9;
<line: 20> 80:3-18. The Hearing Officer's decision does not explicitly rely on the parents' testimony alone,
<line: 21> and her findings on the adequacy of goals and accommodations implicitly credit the testimony of
<line: 22> M.N.'s experts. Once the Hearing Officer found that special education case manager Nikki
<line: 23> Moore ("Ms. Moore') was not credible, she also implicitly found that other school officials on
<line: 24> the IEP team lost credibility on goals and accommodations because they relied on Ms. Moore's
<line: 25> data.  Her commentary on Dr. Joey Phillips ("Dr. Phillips'), assistant principal at PAMS,

[ABANDON]
<line: 30> 15

[TEXT]
<line: 2> supports this reading because she only discredits him due to his reliance on that data. See.
<line: 3> Decision at 26.  Thus, the Hearing Officer's finding regarding Ms. Moore's credibility
<line: 4> undermines Virginia Beach's arguments here.

[TEXT]
<line: 6> For the issue of smaller class sizes, the Hearing Officer was not required to make explicit
<line: 7> credibility determinations on every witness because her implicit determinations hold the same
<line: 8> weight here. See Z.P., 399 F.3d at 307. Virginia Beach does not address that legal standard, and.
<line: 9> thus, its argument here fails..

[TEXT]
<line: 11> For the issue of hearing M.N. in a classroom, the Hearing Officer relies on three (3)
<line: 12> different sources of evidence: the documented lack of volume and projection in M.N.'s voice,
<line: 13> her personal observations, and the testimony of Ms. Judy Jankowski ("Ms. Jankowski"), the.
<line: 14> educational administrator at CBA, who testified that CBA had to implement a rule that everyone
<line: 15> is silent when M.N. speaks in order to hear her. See Decision at 26. Virginia Beach cites no
<line: 16> authority for why the Hearing Officer cannot use her own observations to make credibility
<line: 17> determinations, and it is not at all clear that deciding how audible M.N. is in a classroom.
<line: 18> amounts to imposing her own educational policy on Virginia Beach. The Court need not decide.
<line: 19> that issue, though, because that was not the sole basis for the Hearing Officer's decision. Thus,
<line: 20> any errors under this topic are not severe enough to deprive this Court of reviewable findings.

[TITLE]
<line: 22> iv.
<line: 23> Analysis of Private Placement.

[TEXT]
<line: 25> Virginia Beach contends that the Hearing Officer engaged in an impermissible compare
<line: 26> and-contrast analysis to determine whether CBA was an appropriate placement. Doc. 55 at 24.

[ABANDON]
<line: 28> explicitly offered a dim view of Mrs. Harrison's abilities and implicitly offered a dim view of her data, too. Virginia
<line: 29> Beach makes no attempt to defend Mrs. Harrison's data, likely recognizing this problem.
<line: 30> 6 Furthermore, it is not at all clear whether Virginia Beach's witnesses receive any net deference when the
<line: 31> contrasting witness testimony (Ms. Jankowski) is also from an educator. Virginia Beach disregards the Hearing
<line: 32> Officer's reference to Ms. Jankowski's testimony and does not argue this issue, and the Court need not reach it,
<line: 33> either.

[ABANDON]
<line: 35> 16

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Virginia Beach's authority in support of that argument does not extend as far as it represents.
<line: 3> though. It is correct that parents cannot demonstrate that a proposed placement fails to provide
<line: 4> FAPE through evidence of a better program because "the [IDEA] does not require the
<line: 5> 'furnishing of every special service necessary to maximize each handicapped child's potential.
<line: 6> MM, 303 F.3d at 527 (quoting Hartmann y. Loudoun County Bd. of Educ., 118 F.3d 996, 1001
<line: 7> (4th Cir. 1997) (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at 199-200)); see also Hessler by Britt v. State Bd. of
<line: 8> Educ. of Maryland, 700 F.2d 134, 139 (4th Cir. 1983) ("In sum, because a given educational
<line: 9> placement is allegedly more appropriate than another, it does not follow that the less appropriate.
<line: 10> program is not 'appropriate' within the meaning of the Act.") Nevertheless, it does not follow
<line: 11> from that proposition that compare-and-contrast is always impermissible. The primary case cited
<line: 12> by Virginia Beach merely bans compare-and-contrast in a case where (1) it is undisputed that the
<line: 13> public school cannot provide FAPE, and the parties are disputing between private school
<line: 14> placements; and (2) the Hearing Officer performed no substantive analysis otherwise. See Sch.
<line: 15> Bd. of the City of Suffolk v. Rose, 133 F. Supp. 3d 803, 827 (E.D. Va. 2015). That case does not
<line: 16> purport to establish any rule regarding compare-and-contrast analysis, instead only observing
<line: 17> that a Hearing Officer cannot substitute that analysis for the required analysis. See id..

[TEXT]
<line: 19> The Hearing Officer's decision satisfied the correct legal standard. She primarily.
<line: 20> assessed whether CBA offers FAPE based on M.N.'s actual performance. Decision at 27
<line: 21> Actual performance is a relevant factor, but not the only factor, in determining whether a
<line: 22> placement offers FAPE.  See M.S., 553 F.3d at 326-27. The Hearing Officer also applied
<line: 23> several other factors to support her decision:.

[TEXT]
<line: 25> CBA can provide the services that [M.N.] requires. They provide [M.N.] with the.
<line: 26> flexibility to rearrange her scheduling and programs as she progresses. She is able.
<line: 27> to be heard and her social skills are improving. Through the direct services.
<line: 28> provided at CBA, [M.N.'s] full array of disabilities are addressed. The small

[TEXT]
<line: 2> classroom and small school size provide her the individualized attention she
<line: 3> requires to receive educational benefit.

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Decision at 27. Her recitation of facts on the pages prior to these findings does not alter the
<line: 6> conclusion that these findings show independent analysis of CBA, even if the prior facts
<line: 7> compare CBA with PAMS. Thus, any errors under this topic are not severe enough to deprive
<line: 8> this Court of reviewable findings..

[TEXT]
<line: 10> Despite the lack of any errors requiring remand here, a certain related error deserves
<line: 11> noting at this stage. Virginia Beach's brief quotes the related error:

[TEXT]
<line: 13> Here, the Hearing Officer engaged in this very "compare and contrast" analysis
<line: 14> that courts caution against. The Hearing Officer expressly found that:
<line: 15> [T]he educational benefits available to [M.N.] in a traditional, inclusive or
<line: 16> special education classroom at Princess Anne Middle School, even if
<line: 17> supplemented with appropriate aids and services, in comparison to the
<line: 18> educational benefits she will receive from CBA, are negligible.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Doc. 55 at 24 (quoting Decision at 27 (emphasis added)). Virginia Beach tries to use the
<line: 21> analysis regarding PAMS to impugn the analysis regarding CBA. See id. An error regarding
<line: 22> PAMS does not compel any result regarding the Hearing Officer's decision. If the draft IEPs
<line: 23> denied FAPE, and CBA provided FAPE, then this Court need not decide whether PAMS could
<line: 24> offer FAPE apart from the content of the draft IEPs. See A.K., 484 F.3d at 679 (noting that
<line: 25> reimbursement for private placement relies on assessment of the IEP and of the adequacy of the
<line: 26> private placement). Thus, the Court FINDS that the Hearing Officer erred in assessing PAMS
<line: 27> through compare-and-contrast, but the Court need not take any other action on the issue because
<line: 28> no finding on PAMS is necessary to the disposition of this case.

<line: 6> Implementation of the IEP for 2014-2015 and Whether Virginia Beach Provided FAPE

[TEXT]
<line: 8> Virginia Beach challenges the Hearing Officer's finding that it failed to properly
<line: 9> implement the IEP for 2014-2015 such that it denied M.N. a FAPE, arguing that the finding was
<line: 10> based solely on parent testimony. Doc. 55 at 25. Failure to implement a material portion of an
<line: 11> IEP violates the IDEA, but failure to perfectly execute an IEP does not amount to denial of.
<line: 12> FAPE. See Sumter Cty. Sch. Dist. 17 v. Heffernan ex rel. TH, 642 F.3d 478, 484 (4th Cir. 2011)
<line: 13> (citing agreement with the Fifth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits)..

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Virginia Beach undermines its argument by selectively quoting the findings in the
<line: 16> Hearing Officer's decision. The Hearing Officer's decision relied on four (4) facts. Decision at
<line: 17> 14-15. First, she cited Mrs. Norman's testimony. Id. at 14. Second, she cited an admission
<line: 18> from school officials at an IEP meeting that they failed to implement portions of the IEP. Id.
<line: 19> Third, she cited M.N.'s regression evidenced by test results. Id. Finally, she cited the fact that
<line: 20> M.N.'s fall 2014 teacher was placed on a performance improvement plan when she "failed to.
<line: 21> collect and effectively analyze data to meet the diverse needs of her special education students
<line: 22> which has led to ineffective planning and instructional delivery" and was later removed from her
<line: 23> position. Id. at 14-15 (quoting Exs. 23.061-062 (Doc. 31 at 61-62). Contrary to Virginia
<line: 24> Beach's argument, the Hearing Officer did not rely solely on parent testimony but instead relied
<line: 25> on a combination of Mrs. Norman's testimony with several other pieces of evidence to reach a
<line: 26> conclusion regarding implementation of the IEP in 2014-2015. Thus, the Court FINDS that

<line: 2> The Fourth Circuit has no bright line for what constitutes a material failure to implement

<line: 4> consistently implement half the accommodations in an IEP is a material failure because it defeats
<line: 5> the purpose of the IEP. "Congress did not intend that a school system could discharge its
<line: 6> duty .. . by providing a program that produces some minimal academic advancement, no matter
<line: 7> how trivial." Id. (quoting Hall ex rel. Hall v. Vance Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 774 F.2d 629, 636 (4th
<line: 8> Cir. 1985)). Thus, the Court FINDS that Virginia Beach materially failed to implement the
<line: 9> 2014-2015 IEP such that it denied FAPE to M.N because its ineffective teacher failed to
<line: 10> implement half the accommodations in the IEP, harming M.N.'s academic progress throughout

<line: 19> While the Hearing Officer's findings regarding the proposed IEPs are rather sparse, the

<line: 21> Decision at 25. Virginia Beach's last proposed IEP for 2015-2016 based all three (3) of its key

<line: 23> more restrictive environment for education-- on Ms. Moore's data. See Ex. B057 (Doc 22 at

<line: 25> not believe Ms. Moore's data, agreed with CBA's assessment that the data reflected a need for
<line: 26> retention in fifth grade, and further repeatedly expressed that M.N. currently needs a more

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Virginia Beach's disagreement with the decision is not unreasonable. The IDEA strongly
<line: 3> encourages placing students in the LRE.See 20 U.S.C.  1412(a)(5) (2018).
<line: 4>  This
<line: 5> encouragement is not an unbreakable requirement, though, because the purpose of LRE is to
<line: 6> ensure that schools seek integration of special education students with the rest of the school, not
<line: 7> to harm the academic progress of special education students. See M.S., 553 F.3d at 327; see also

<line: 9> Beach's proposal for 2015-2016 may have been appropriate if M.N. had not experienced trouble

[TEXT]
<line: 13> Virginia Beach apparently read the last proposed IEPs in a better light than the Hearing
<line: 14> Officer read them because it trusted in the ability of its staff to remedy M.N.'s problems during
<line: 15> 2015-2016. The Court cannot assess Virginia Beach's proposal in that light, though, because it
<line: 16> is restricted to considering the explicit terms of the IEP. A.K., 484 F.3d at 682. The Court
<line: 17> FOUND that Virginia Beach failed to provide a FAPE to M.N. in fifth grade in 2014-2015. See
<line: 18> supra Part IIl.B.i. In line with that finding, the Court further FINDS that Virginia Beach failed
<line: 19> to offer M.N. a FAPE for 2015-2016 because it sought to place her in an academic program
<line: 20> beyond her abilities --- namely, sixth grade. The Court need not reach any of the other potential
<line: 21> difficulties with the IEP in light of that finding, nor can it address the capabilities of PAMS staff.

[TEXT]
<line: 26> For the 2016-2017 last proposed IEP, the Hearing Officer's credibility determinations
<line: 27> regarding some of M.N.'s witnesses support her finding that Virginia Beach failed to offer
<line: 28> FAPE. Two (2) particular portions of her opinion are relevant. The first portion summarized the
<line: 29> experts' testimony:

[ABANDON]
<line: 31> 21

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Drs. Ling (Tr. pg. 15) Cotton (Tr. pg. 239) and Lucker (Tr. pg. 172) summarily
<line: 3> testified that [M.N.] is more suited to learn in a small environment due to the way
<line: 4> in which her many disabilities and medical conditions interact with one another.
<line: 5> At this stage in her life, requires constant individualized instruction to keep
<line: 6> focused and to learn. Dr. Ling, a neurologist who tested in September of 2015,.
<line: 7> testified that experiences disorganization, processing weaknesses and difficulties
<line: 8> with physical stamina. (Jt. Ex. C172-197)

[TEXT]
<line: 10> Decision at 25. The second portion credits the testimony of Dr. William D. Ling ("Dr. Ling"), a

[TEXT]
<line: 12> licensed clinical psychologist, and Dr. Jay Lucker (Dr. Lucker'), an audiologist:

[TEXT]
<line: 14> Testimony from [M.N.'s] doctors, including the evaluations from Dr. Ling and
<line: 15> Dr. Lucker, clearly indicate that [M.N.] needs continuous specialized and
<line: 16> individual attention in a smaller environment to receive educational benefit
<line: 17> Princess Anne Middle School with its 1,470 student population would not
<line: 18> educationally benefit [M.N.] regardless of how well-intended VBCPS may be. In
<line: 19> her case, with her multiple neurological, mental, processing, cognitive and
<line: 20> physical disabilities, at this stage in her life, [M.N.] requires the small school
<line: 21> environment offered at CBA to effectively learn both academically and socially
<line: 22> CBA, however, is admonished to educate [M.N.] towards independence with the
<line: 23> ultimate goal of returning her to public school. With no medical or cognitive
<line: 24> setbacks, [M.N.] should be more mature and more prepared to handle the rigors of
<line: 25> public school life after leaving CBA. Hopefully, via the educational benefits and
<line: 26> the FAPE she receives from CBA, [M.N.] will learn how best to deal with her
<line: 27> multiple disabilities and will have educationally and socially progressed and
<line: 28> matured enough to attend a VBCPS public school.

[TEXT]
<line: 30> Id. at 28. The Hearing Officer did not distinguish between the proposed IEPs and the school
<line: 31> years with this criticism, and this criticism was inappropriate for 2015-2016 because Dr. Ling's
<line: 32> and Dr. Lucker's reports were not available to Virginia Beach until October 2015 and August
<line: 33> 2016, respectively. See Ex. C172 (Doc. 36 at 1); Ex. 15.001 (Doc. 30 at 33). A hearing officer
<line: 34> and a court must assess the adequacy of an IEP based on the information available at the time it
<line: 35> was written. See Schaffer, 554 F.3d at 477. Despite that error, the grade level issue for 2015--
<line: 36> 2016 was sufficient to find a denial of FAPE under that IEP, as discussed infra, and at least Dr.
<line: 37> Ling's expert report was appropriate to consider for 2016-2017 because he completed his report
<line: 38> in advance of the last proposed IEP for that year. Dr. Lucker's report is also proper evidence in

[ABANDON]
<line: 40> 22

[TEXT]
<line: 2> this proceeding because it is only a records review that assesses what Virginia Beach should
<line: 3> have known and done based on the information available for the last proposed IEP. See Ex.
<line: 4> 15.001-002 (listing records reviewed). Furthermore, the Hearing Officer's view of these experts
<line: 5> continues a clear theme throughout the record: M.N. needed different services than what Virginia
<line: 6> Beach offered for now. The Hearing Officer stated that M.N. should be able to handle public
<line: 7> school after some time at CBA as long as she suffered no setbacks there. Decision at 28. This
<line: 8> finding expresses that the chief concern was that Virginia Beach did not propose adequate
<line: 9> remedies in any IEP for the setback that M.N. suffered at Red Mill, and accordingly, that M.N.'s
<line: 10> experts were credible in their assessment that the IEPs failed to offer FAPE..

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Virginia Beach's arguments against these findings largely amount to preferring their own.
<line: 13> experts over M.N.'s experts. It extensively reviews Dr. Phillips's testimony regarding the IEP
<line: 14> without addressing that the Hearing Officer found him credible but misled by his staff's
<line: 15> unreliable data. Doc. 55 at 28-30. It also cites two (2) other Virginia Beach witnesses in
<line: 16> support of the adequacy of its IEP without addressing the issue of implicit credibility findings..
<line: 17> Id. at 30. It offers no persuasive analysis as to why the Court should accept either of the two (2)
<line: 18> other witnesses' testimony. See id. Ms. Vasely's testimony about class size is an admissible.
<line: 19> opinion in opposition to the other witnesses, but the Hearing Officer found the other witnesses
<line: 20> more credible. See id. Speech/language pathologist Michelle Galvin's ("Galvin's") testimony
<line: 21> that M.N. could be heard in large classrooms was similarly admissible but contradicted both
<line: 22> other testimony in the record and other sources of evidence discussed infra under the alleged
<line: 23> procedural violations. See id.; see also supra Part IlI.A.ili. Failure to accept Virginia Beach's
<line: 24> witnesses testimony, without more, is no basis for reversal of a Hearing Officer's credibility.

[TEXT]
<line: 2> findings. Z.P., 399 F.3d at 307 (citing Malone, 762 F.2d at 1217). Thus, Virginia Beach has
<line: 3> provided no persuasive ground for the Court to reject the Hearing Officer's finding.

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Further evidence in the record as to Dr. Ling's and Dr. Lucker's testimony also supports.
<line: 6> the Hearing Officer's findings. Dr. Ling testified that the June 9, 2016 IEP failed to identify
<line: 7> "what specific intervention would be applied or provided to [M.N.] which can address
<line: 8> the ... processing demands and the limitations that she has." Tr. at 62:18-21. He also testified
<line: 9> that some interventions can be implemented in a public school, while others cannot, and that
<line: 10> Virginia Beach's data and the last proposed IEP for 2016-2017 indicated that Virginia Beach did
<line: 11> not know what interventions to apply. Id. at 73:19-74:4. He also specified that a key issue is
<line: 12> Virginia Beach's reliance on its own capabilities:

[TEXT]
<line: 14> "[W]hat I understand is the opinion of Virginia Beach in saying that some of the.
<line: 15> interventions that are necessary would be implemented through teachers, but
<line: 16> there's no identification within the IEP of what interventions would be applied
<line: 17> under the circumstances. And, therefore, the fit between what interventions are
<line: 18> being presented and that between her capacities and what her needs are is not
<line: 19> clear through the course of this IEP..

[TEXT]
<line: 21> Id. at 63:2-9. He emphasized on cross-examination from Virginia Beach's counsel that he has
<line: 22> participated in drafting IEPs that carry the level of specificity he believes is necessary. Id. at
<line: 23> 80:3-18. Similarly, Dr. Lucker testified that the audiology goals were too vague and that several
<line: 24> interventions were necessary. Id. at 211:5-214:13, 217:6-221:6. Perhaps the Hearing Officer's
<line: 25> summary of their testimony was misguided because she emphasized the need for smaller
<line: 26> classrooms, and neither witness seemed to focus on that issue, as Virginia Beach rightly argues.
<line: 27> Dr. Ling observed in response to the Hearing Officer's questions that smaller classrooms on their
<line: 28> own would be insufficient to address M.N.'s needs. Id. at 75:12-20. Despite that possible
<line: 29> analytical error by the Hearing Officer, testimony from both witnesses supports the Hearing
<line: 30> Officer's conclusion that "the final proposed IEP was insufficient to meet [M.N.'s] complex

[ABANDON]
<line: 32>  24

[TEXT]
<line: 2> needs .... Decision at 27. Thus, the Court FINDS that the last proposed IEP for 2016-2017
<line: 3> failed to offer M.N. a FAPE because less detailed IEPs had not worked for M.N.'s complex
<line: 4> needs, because Virginia Beach had the necessary information to address M.N.'s audiological
<line: 5> disorders in detail in time for the IEP for 2016-2017, and because Virginia Beach failed to add
<line: 6> that necessary level of detail.?

[TITLE]
<line: 8> iii.
<line: 9> Provision of FAPE by CBA

[TEXT]
<line: 11> As noted supra, Virginia Beach does not challenge this issue in its briefs beyond the.
<line: 12> procedural violation, but it raised a substantive challenge in other documents in this case and
<line: 13> appears to have intended such a challenge here. Compare VB Counterclaim  56(r), (t) with
<line: 14> Doc. 55 at 24. The Court also must find the provision of FAPE at CBA in order to grant M.N.
<line: 15> reimbursement. See A.K., 484 F.3d at 679 (quoting A.B., 354 F.3d at 320). Thus, carefully
<line: 16> reading the briefs, and in view of the relevant legal standard, the Court will address the substance
<line: 17> of the question for purposes of entering findings on both of the required elements for
<line: 18> reimbursement..

[TEXT]
<line: 20> The Hearing Officer's findings support the conclusion that CBA offers FAPE. There are
<line: 21> seven (7) relevant findings: improved test scores at CBA, flexibility to rearrange scheduled and
<line: 22> programming, ability to be heard in the classroom, improved social skills, and access to direct
<line: 23> services for disabilities, a small classroom, and a small school. Decision at 27. While Virginia
<line: 24> Beach may be correct that improved test scores and a small classroom alone are insufficient to
<line: 25> support the adequacy of CBA, Virginia Beach does not address the remainder of the relevant
<line: 26> findings in any of its documents. Instead, it emphasizes that "school population and class size'"
<line: 27> were the key factors in the Hearing Officer's decision. Doc. 66 at 5. This view of the Hearing

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> 7 This finding does not mean that a very detailed IEP is always necessary for every student. Further detail is
<line: 30> necessary for the IEP to offer FAPE in this instance because of the particular facts in M.N.'s history with Virginia
<line: 31> Beach.

[ABANDON]
<line: 33> 25

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Officer's decision is based on some of the Hearing Officer's commentary scattered throughout
<line: 3> the transcript and the decision. Nevertheless, this view also does not relieve Virginia Beach of
<line: 4> the obligation to address the other findings, no matter how much weight it believes that the
<line: 5> Hearing Officer attributed to her own findings. The seven (7) findings cumulatively reflect that
<line: 6> CBA offered specific interventions needed to remedy M.N.'s learning deficiencies from her bad
<line: 7> year in Virginia Beach schools, and no evidence in the record contradicts those findings. Thus,
<line: 8> the Court FINDS that CBA offered FAPE to M.N..

[TITLE]
<line: 10> iv.
<line: 11> Alternative Damages Theory: Compensatory Damages

[TEXT]
<line: 13> M.N. alternatively argues that the Hearing Officer properly awarded compensatory
<line: 14> education, either for 2016-2017 or for both 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 depending on the brief.
<line: 15> See Doc. 53 at 11 (making the former argument); Doc. 59 at 20 (making the latter argument).
<line: 16> Because the Court FOUND that Virginia Beach failed to offer FAPE to M.N. in its respective
<line: 17> last proposed IEPs for both school years, M.N. is entitled to reimbursement for unilateral private
<line: 18> placement for both of those years, and the issue of compensatory education is MOOT.

[TITLE]
<line: 20> V.
<line: 21> Tutoring Fees

[TEXT]
<line: 23> Although Virginia Beach has the most significant disagreements with the Hearing
<line: 24> Officer's decision, M.N. also has a disagreement, as she seeks reversal of the Hearing Officer's
<line: 25> denial of reimbursement for tutoring and social skills groups during 2014-2015. Doc. 53 at 10.
<line: 26> The Hearing Officer found as follows:

[TEXT]
<line: 28> In regard to the parents' prayer for reimbursement for tutoring and social skills.
<line: 29> training, these tools served to benefit [M.N.] with or without any actions on the
<line: 30> part of VBCPS. The parents sought these tools to support [M.N.] and to help her
<line: 31> excel, regardless of the actions of VBCPS. There will be no reimbursement for
<line: 32> tutoring or social skills training. I FIND that the parents did not meet their burden
<line: 33> on this issue, therefore relief is denied.

[ABANDON]
<line: 35> 26

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Decision at 22. M.N. argues that those fees were necessary to remedy Virginia Beach's failure
<line: 3> to provide FAPE during that school year. Doc. 53 at 10. She cites Florence Cty. Sch. Dist. Four
<line: 4> v. Carter By & Through Carter, 510 U.S. 7 (1993) for the proposition that all appropriate private
<line: 5> services are reimbursable after denial of FAPE. See id.; see also id. at 8. Virginia Beach does
<line: 6> not meaningfully oppose this argument beyond its general assertions that M.N. is not entitled to
<line: 7> any reimbursement. See generally Docs. 55, 66.

[TEXT]
<line: 9> M.N.'s argument is problematic because she seeks a highly unusual remedy, and an
<line: 10> award of tutoring fees would overcompensate her in addition to the other awards in this case.
<line: 11> Florence stands for the proposition that a court who finds a violation of IDEA "is authorized to
<line: 12> 'grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate." Florence, 510 U.S. at 15-16 (quoting
<line: 13> 20 U.S.C.  1415(e)(2) (currently codified at  1415(i)(2)(C)(iii)). It further cautions that a
<line: 14> court must consider the "appropriate and reasonable" level of reimbursement and may even deny
<line: 15> full reimbursement for tuition if it finds such expenses unreasonable. Id. at 16. M.N. cites no
<line: 16> case law, nor has the Court found any, where a court reimbursed tutoring services during the
<line: 17> school year, as opposed to reimbursing unilateral private school placement. Furthermore, the
<line: 18> Court already FOUND that CBA offered the required remediation, and it is not at all clear that
<line: 19> the tutoring was necessary or even helpful given M.N.'s poor academic performance during
<line: 20> 2014-2015. Thus, the Court FINDS that M.N. is not entitled to reimbursement for tutoring and
<line: 21> social skills training and DENIES such reimbursement.

[TITLE]
<line: 23> C.
<line: 24> Whether M.N. is Entitled to Attorney's Fees.

[TEXT]
<line: 26> Neither Party disputes that the Court has discretion to award attorney's fees to M.N. if
<line: 27> she is the prevailing party. See Doc. 53 at 11; Doc. 55 at 31. The IDEA provides that "the court,
<line: 28> in its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys' fees as part of the costs' to her parents. 20

[ABANDON]
<line: 30> 27

[TEXT]
<line: 2> U.S.C. g 1415(i)(3)(B)(i). Because M.N. is suing by and through her parents, any award of fees
<line: 3> is inevitably payable to them. Based on its decisions in M.N.'s favor, the Court FINDS that
<line: 4> M.N. is the prevailing party and GRANTS attorney's fees. M.N. must file her Motion for
<line: 5> Attorneys' Fees with appropriate supporting evidence. Virginia Beach will have ten (10) days
<line: 6> from receipt of the Motion for Attorneys' Fees to respond with appropriate supporting evidence.

<line: 8> IV.
<line: 9> CONCLUSION

[TEXT]
<line: 11> For the reasons stated herein, the Court AFFIRMS the decision of the Hearing Officer.
<line: 12> and FINDS as follows:

[TEXT]
<line: 14> that Virginia Beach materially failed to implement the 2014-2015 IEP such that it
<line: 15> denied a free appropriate public education ("FAPE") to M.N.;
<line: 16> that Virginia Beach failed to offer M.N. a FAPE for 2015-2016 because it sought
<line: 17> to place her in an academic program beyond her abilities, namely, sixth grade;.
<line: 18> that the last proposed IEP for 2016-2017 failed to offer M.N. a FAPE because
<line: 19> less detailed IEPs had not worked for M.N.'s complex needs, because Virginia
<line: 20> Beach had the necessary information to address M.N.'s audiological disorders in
<line: 21> detail in time for the IEP for 2016-2017, and because Virginia Beach failed to
<line: 22> add that necessary level of detail;
<line: 23> that Chesapeake Bay Academy ("CBA') offered FAPE to M.N.; and.
<line: 24> that M.N. is not entitled to reimbursement for tutoring and social skills training.
<line: 25> In accordance, with those findings, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff's/Counter-Defendant's Motion
<line: 26> for Summary Judgment, Doc. 52, IN PART, entering judgment in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-
<line: 27> Defendant for reimbursement for tuition at Chesapeake Bay Academy for 2015-2016 and 2016-
