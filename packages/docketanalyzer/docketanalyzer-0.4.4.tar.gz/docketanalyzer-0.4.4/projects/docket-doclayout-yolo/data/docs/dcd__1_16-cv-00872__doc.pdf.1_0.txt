<line: 4> administrative adjudication designated In the Matter of Integrity Advance, LLC and James R.
<line: 5> Carnes, 2015-CFPB-0029 (filed Nov. 18, 2015).

[TEXT]
<line: 7> 2.
<line: 8> In its administrative action, the Bureau alleges, among other things, that Plaintiffs
<line: 9> violated Section 1036 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (“CFPA”), 12 U.S.C. § 5536
<line: 10> through alleged violations of the federal consumer financial laws, including section 1031 of the
<line: 11> CFPA, 12 U.S.C. § 5531, which prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices
<line: 12> (UDAAP).

[TEXT]
<line: 14> 3.
<line: 15> The Bureau can only pursue CFPA claims, as allowed under sections 1031 and
<line: 16> 1036 of the CFPA, against entities or individuals that are “covered persons” within the meaning
<line: 17> of the statute. A “covered person” is any entity or person “that engages in offering or providing
<line: 18> a consumer financial product or service.” See 12 U.S.C. § 5481(6)(A).

[TEXT]
<line: 20> 4.
<line: 21> Plaintiffs Integrity Advance, which formerly offered short-term, small-dollar
<line: 22> loans to consumers, and its CEO and President Plaintiff Carnes stopped offering or providing
<line: 23> any consumer financial product or service before the Bureau had authority to pursue claims
<line: 24> under the CFPA as to Plaintiffs.

[TEXT]
<line: 26> 5.
<line: 27> Under the CFPA, certain – but not all – pre-existing consumer financial protection
<line: 28> authorities transferred to the Bureau from other prudential regulators on July 21, 2011 (the
<line: 29> “transfer date,” and also the “effective date”). In particular, this “transfer authority” was limited
<line: 30> in scope to “all powers and duties that were vested in the [federal banking regulators].”

[TEXT]
<line: 32> 6.
<line: 33> Plaintiffs are nonbanks that were not covered by the “transfer authority” that
<line: 34> transferred to the Bureau on July 21, 2011.

[TEXT]
<line: 36> 7.
<line: 37> This “transfer authority” did not include authority over nonbank “covered
<line: 38> persons” within the meaning of the CFPA.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 8.
<line: 5> Under the Congressional framing of the CFPA, certain “newly-created” authority
<line: 6> could only be assumed and exercised by the Bureau’s first lawfully-appointed Director. This
<line: 7> “newly-created” authority includes the CFPB’s ability to prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive
<line: 8> acts or practices under the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. § 5531, 5563(a)(1)(B); and to pursue claims against
<line: 9> nonbank “covered persons” that were not previously subject to the authority of the federal
<line: 10> banking regulators.

[TEXT]
<line: 12> 9.
<line: 13> All of the Bureau’s powers are concentrated within the hands of a single Director,
<line: 14> who is appointed by the President, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, to serve for a
<line: 15> five-year term. On January 4, 2012, during a Congressional recess, the President appointed the
<line: 16> Bureau’s current and first-ever Director, Richard Cordray; other appointments on the same day
<line: 17> and in the same manner were subsequently found to be unlawful.1 On July 16, 2013, the Senate
<line: 18> confirmed the President’s appointment of Mr. Cordray.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> 10.
<line: 21> Upon the Senate’s confirmation of Mr. Cordray on July 16, 2013, the CFPB’s
<line: 22> “newly-created” authority, including the authority to take enforcement actions against nonbank
<line: 23> “covered persons” for violations of the Bureau’s UDAAP authority and other federal consumer
<line: 24> financial laws vested.

[TEXT]
<line: 26> 11.
<line: 27> Here, when the Bureau’s “newly created” authority vested on July 16, 2013, the
<line: 28> Bureau lacked authority under the CFPA, including any UDAAP authority as to Plaintiffs. In
<line: 29> July 2013 Plaintiffs were not engaging in the offering or provision of a consumer financial

<line: 31> 1 In July 2014, the Supreme Court held that the recess appointments of three members of the
<line: 32> National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”), appointed on the same day as Mr. Cordray, were
<line: 33> unconstitutional because the Senate was not in recess. NLRB v. Noel Canning, 134 S. Ct. 2550,
<line: 34> 2556-57, 2577-78 (2014). Applying the Court’s holding, by the identical facts and reasoning,
<line: 35> Mr. Cordray’s recess appointment was also unconstitutional.

<line: 8> Plaintiffs also never engaged in any other conduct – at any time – as to which the

<line: 11> 13.
<line: 12> Because Plaintiffs never fell within the Bureau’s authority under the CFPA,
<line: 13> Plaintiffs ask this Court to temporarily restrain, and preliminarily and permanently enjoin the
<line: 14> CFPB from pursuing its claims under the CFPA against Plaintiffs, and to issue a declaratory
<line: 15> judgment that the Bureau does not have authority to pursue its CFPA claims against Plaintiffs.

<line: 5> This Court should exercise jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims because the CFPA
<line: 6> does not provide a “statutory scheme” that displays a “fairly discernible” Congressional intent to

<line: 11> Further, there would be a presumption against any implied intent to limit the
<line: 12> jurisdiction of the court because (a) without judicial review at this stage, meaningful judicial
<line: 13> review will be foreclosed; (b) Plaintiffs’ claims are wholly collateral to the review provisions of

<line: 4> Background of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

[TEXT]
<line: 6> 27.
<line: 7> The CFPA establishes the CFPB as an independent executive agency within the
<line: 8> Federal Reserve System. 12 U.S.C. § 5491 (2012).

[TEXT]
<line: 10> 28.
<line: 11> The Bureau opened its doors on July 21, 2011. This date is referred to as the
<line: 12> “transfer date,” (the date on which certain pre-existing consumer financial protection laws
<line: 13> transferred to the Bureau from other prudential regulators). See 12 U.S.C. § 5582; Designated
<line: 14> Transfer Date, 75 Fed. Reg. 57252 (Sept. 20, 2010).

[TEXT]
<line: 16> 29.
<line: 17> July 21, 2011 is also the “effective date” because it is the earliest date on which
<line: 18> certain enforcement and other statutory provisions under the CFPA could take effect, provided
<line: 19> certain statutory strictures are met. See 12 U.S.C. § 5582; Designated Transfer Date, 75 Fed.
<line: 20> Reg. 57252 (Sept. 20, 2010).

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 30.
<line: 23> Congress bifurcated the authorities of the Bureau. First, “transfer” authorities –
<line: 24> authorities transferred to the CFPB from the federal banking (or prudential) regulators – vested
<line: 25> in either the Director or the Secretary of the Treasury on July 21, 2011, 12 U.S.C. § 5586(a).
<line: 26> The “transfer” authorities do not include the authority to enforce federal consumer financial laws
<line: 27> as to nonbanks, such as Plaintiffs. Second, “newly-created” authorities vested solely in the
<line: 28> Director whenever he or she would be lawfully appointed and confirmed.

[TEXT]
<line: 30> 31.
<line: 31> The Bureau’s powers are concentrated within the hands of a single Director, who
<line: 32> is appointed by the President, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, to serve for a five-
<line: 33> year term. 12 C.F.R. § 5491(b).

[TEXT]
<line: 35> 32.
<line: 36> On January 4, 2012, the President appointed Richard Cordray to serve as Director
<line: 37> of the Bureau during a Congressional recess, under the Recess Appointments Clause. See U.S.

<line: 8> 34.
<line: 9> On July 16, 2013, the United States Senate confirmed Mr. Cordray to serve as
<line: 10> Director of the Bureau for a five-year term.

[TEXT]
<line: 12> 35.
<line: 13> In July 2014, the Supreme Court held that the recess appointments of three
<line: 14> members of the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”), purportedly appointed on the same
<line: 15> day as Mr. Cordray, were unconstitutional because the Senate was not in recess. NLRB v. Noel
<line: 16> Canning, 134 S. Ct. 2550, 2556–57, 2577–78 (2014). The Court’s holding necessarily applies to
<line: 17> the Director’s appointment, as well, as that case involves the same facts, and, thus, reasoning.

<line: 22> The Bureau issued a civil investigative demand (“CID”) to Integrity Advance on
<line: 23> January 7, 2013.

<line: 26> The Bureau filed a Notice of Charges in its administrative forum against Plaintiffs
<line: 27> on November 18, 2015.

[TEXT]
<line: 29> 38.
<line: 30> Plaintiffs filed an Answer on December 9, 2015 – as required under the CFPB’s
<line: 31> Rules of Practice for Adjudication Proceedings. 12 C.F.R. § 1081.201(a) (“Within 14 days of
<line: 32> service of the notice of charges, respondent shall file an answer as designated in the notice of
<line: 33> charges.”)

[TEXT]
<line: 35> 39.
<line: 36> Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Dismiss on December 21, 2015. The Bureau filed its
<line: 37> Opposition on January 1, 2016, and Plaintiffs filed their Reply on January 25, 2016. The Rules

<line: 12> The CFPA Is Retroactively Applied To Plaintiffs

[TEXT]
<line: 14> 42.
<line: 15> The Appointments Clause and Supreme Court precedent show that Executive
<line: 16> authority can only be delegated to an Officer of the United States.

<line: 19> The Appointments Clause provides important protections to the process of
<line: 20> creating Officers of the United States.

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 44.
<line: 23> This Constitutional framework is also inherent to the CFPA, which provides that
<line: 24> “there is established the position of the Director, who shall serve as the head of the Bureau,” and
<line: 25> that the Director shall “be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.”
<line: 26> 12 U.S.C. § 5491(b)(1)(2).

[TEXT]
<line: 28> 45.
<line: 29> Congress, in Subtitle F and Section 1066 of the CFPA, contemplated bifurcated
<line: 30> Bureau authority. Section 1066 specifically states that “[t]he Secretary [of the Treasury] is
<line: 31> authorized to perform the functions of the Bureau under this subtitle until the Director of the
<line: 32> Bureau is confirmed by the Senate in accordance with section 1011.” 12 U.S.C. § 5586(a).

<line: 19> Under Constitutional principles and the Congressional framing of the CFPB’s

[TEXT]
<line: 23> 51.
<line: 24> Since the first Director of the CFPB was not confirmed until July 16, 2013, the
<line: 25> Bureau did not assume its “newly-created” enforcement authority as to nonbanks until that time.

[TEXT]
<line: 27> 52.
<line: 28> The Bureau’s authority to pursue a CFPA claim as to nonbanks may not be

<line: 30> on or after July 16, 2013.

[TEXT]
<line: 32> 53.
<line: 33> By pursing an action against Plaintiffs for alleged violations of the CFPA that
<line: 34> occurred before July 16, 2013, the Bureau has and continues to undermine core principles of due
<line: 35> process. In short, the Bureau seeks to apply CFPA claims to actors over that have never been

<line: 16> all meaningful judicial review will be foreclosed; (ii) Plaintiffs’ claims are wholly collateral to
<line: 17> the review provisions of the CFPA; and (iii) Plaintiffs’ claims are outside the experience of the
<line: 18> CFPB.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> 56.
<line: 21> Moreover, it is plainly futile to force Plaintiffs to exhaust their administrative
<line: 22> remedies by continuing to defend against CFPA claims that the CFPB does not have authority to
<line: 23> pursue. The Bureau, in bringing the administrative action, has asserted jurisdiction and
<line: 24> authority, which has not been curtailed by the Hearing Officer. The Bureau is substantially
<line: 25> unlikely to find now, or later on in the proceeding, that it, in fact, does not have authority to
<line: 26> pursue its CFPA claims as to Plaintiffs.

[TITLE]
<line: 28> The Continued Prosecution Of The CFPA Claims Will Cause Plaintiffs Irreparable Harm

[TEXT]
<line: 30> 57.
<line: 31> Absent injunctive relief from this Court, Plaintiffs will be forced to continue to
<line: 32> litigate CFPA claims that arise from conduct that occurred before that statute was effective as to
<line: 33> Plaintiffs, which are nonbanks. This constitutional violation, standing alone, constitutes
<line: 34> irreparable injury.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> 58.
<line: 5> Even if Plaintiffs prevail on the underlying merits of the administrative
<line: 6> adjudication, they will still have suffered irreparable harm by having been forced to litigate
<line: 7> claims arising from the retroactive application of the CFPA.

[TEXT]
<line: 9> 59.
<line: 10> Moreover, under the Bureau’s rules, there is no automatic stay of any sanctions
<line: 11> imposed by the Bureau pending appeal to a federal circuit court of appeals. Thus, the availability
<line: 12> of an appeal after an administrative proceeding does not address this harm because the
<line: 13> administratively-imposed sanction already may have taken effect – and the damage therefore
<line: 14> already substantially and harmfully done – by the time the appellate court could rule. See 12
<line: 15> C.F.R. 1081.407(e).

[TEXT]
<line: 17> 60.
<line: 18> Likewise, the harm threatened here cannot be remedied after the fact by money
<line: 19> damages. Governmental immunity doctrines substantially constrain Plaintiffs’ ability to seek
<line: 20> damages from the CFPB.

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 61.
<line: 23> By contrast, the CFPB will suffer no harm from a pause in an administrative
<line: 24> proceeding against Plaintiffs pending final resolution of the constitutional issue presented here.

[TEXT]
<line: 26> 62.
<line: 27> Moreover, the last of the loans that are the subject of the Bureau’s administrative
<line: 28> enforcement action were made approximately three years ago, and Plaintiffs were in the midst of
<line: 29> shutting down the business when the Bureau first started its investigation. Integrity Advance,
<line: 30> while not technically dissolved under state law, has not operated for nearly three years.
<line: 31> Therefore, no consumer would be adversely affected by the requested injunctive relief.

<line: 4> 64.
<line: 5> Congress intentionally bifurcated the CFPB’s authority such that certain “newly-
<line: 6> created” authority could only be assumed and exercised by the Bureau’s lawfully-appointed
<line: 7> Director. That “newly-created” authority forms the basis for the CFPB’s CFPA claims against
<line: 8> Plaintiffs. This newly-created authority also includes the CFPB’s ability to bring enforcement
<line: 9> actions to prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices under the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. §
<line: 10> 5531, 5563(a)(1)(B); and to bring enforcement actions against “covered persons,” which were
<line: 11> not previously subject to the authority of the federal banking agencies, for violations of federal
<line: 12> consumer financial laws.

[TEXT]
<line: 14> 65.
<line: 15> The Bureau’s first-ever Director was not appointed and confirmed until July 16,
<line: 16> 2013, and thus the “newly-created” authority under the CFPA did not vest in the Director until
<line: 17> July 16, 2013.

[TEXT]
<line: 19> 66.
<line: 20> Plaintiffs ceased making loans to consumers in December 2012 and ceased all
<line: 21> operations in June 2013, all before the “newly-created” authority under the CFPA vested in the
<line: 22> Director. Thus, the Bureau lacked authority over Plaintiffs. Nonetheless, the Bureau initiated an
<line: 23> administrative action against Plaintiffs which, by its very nature, represents an unconstitutional
<line: 24> retroactive application of the law.

[TEXT]
<line: 26> 67.
<line: 27> By virtue of the Bureau’s pursuit of CFPA claims that are only retroactive in
<line: 28> nature, Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer a legal wrong in the form of a deprivation
<line: 29> of their right to due process of law guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the United States
<line: 30> Constitution.

[TEXT]
<line: 32> 68.
<line: 33> Plaintiffs’ due process rights will be irreparably harmed if a temporary restraining
<line: 34> order does not issue to stay the Bureau from continuing to prosecute its CFPA claims as to
<line: 35> Plaintiffs.

<line: 5> Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claims
<line: 6> under settled law.

[TEXT]
<line: 8> 70.
<line: 9> Plaintiffs will be irreparably injured without injunctive relief, as described above,
<line: 10> and the harm to Plaintiffs if the temporary restraining order is not granted far outweighs any
<line: 11> harm to the government if it is denied; indeed, the Bureau can show no harm resulting from
<line: 12> enjoining the current proceedings.

[TEXT]
<line: 14> 71.
<line: 15> The grant of an injunction will not disserve the public interest, as it is in the
<line: 16> public interest that the constitutional rights of all parties charged by any law enforcement
<line: 17> agency, including the CFPB, be protected, that the CFPA not be applied retroactively in
<line: 18> contravention of well-established principles, and that the appearance of fairness be preserved.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> 72.
<line: 21> Pursuant to the Court’s Local Rules, Plaintiffs contemporaneously apply for a
<line: 22> temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction by separate pleadings.

[TEXT]
<line: 24> 73.
<line: 25> Plaintiffs provided the Bureau with a copy of the complaint, motion for temporary
<line: 26> restraining order and preliminary injunction, and memorandum of points and authorities prior to
<line: 27> filing.

<line: 37> This is a request for a declaratory judgment that the CFPB’s administrative action
<line: 38> against Plaintiffs is unconstitutional.

[TEXT]
<line: 40> 76.
<line: 41> The Constitution and separation of power doctrines require that executive
<line: 42> authority be delegated to an Officer of the United States. Absent a lawfully appointed Officer of
<line: 43> the United States who can assume authority, such authority does not vest. Because Plaintiffs

[TEXT]
<line: 4> never fell within the Bureau’s authority after it had vested on July 16, 2013 with the appointment
<line: 5> of the first-ever Director, the administrative enforcement action against Plaintiffs represents an
<line: 6> unconstitutional retroactive application of the law, and violates Plaintiffs’ due process rights.

[TEXT]
<line: 8> 77.
<line: 9> By initiating and continuing to pursue its administrative action, the CFPB has
<line: 10> asserted its authority and is substantially unlikely to find that it lacks authority now or at any
<line: 11> stage of the administrative proceeding.

[TEXT]
<line: 13> 78.
<line: 14> Therefore, an actual and substantial controversy exists as to whether the CFPB
<line: 15> has the authority to pursue its administrative action. This case is within this Court’s jurisdiction
<line: 16> and the Court, upon the filing of this Complaint, may declare the rights and other legal relations
<line: 17> of any interested party seeking such declaration, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201.

[TEXT]
<line: 19> 79.
<line: 20> To clarify and settle the legal relations at issue and afford the parties relief from
<line: 21> the insecurity and uncertainty with respect to the rights and obligations of the parties, Plaintiffs
<line: 22> are entitled to a declaratory judgment that (1) Plaintiffs never fell within the CFPA’s jurisdiction;
<line: 23> and (2) that the Bureau does not have authority to pursue any of its CFPA claims now pending in
<line: 24> the administrative proceeding as to Plaintiffs.
