[TITLE]
<line: 16> ORDER

[TEXT]
<line: 18> On January 8, 1997, the court sentenced petitioner Ronald Schwensow to 262 months
<line: 19> in prison, concurrent, on two counts of possessing a firearm as a felon, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1),
<line: 20> after concluding that he qualified for an enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal
<line: 21> Act (“ACCA”), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), based on prior convictions for burglary, robbery, and
<line: 22> reckless injury.  In Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2251 (2015), the Supreme Court
<line: 23> declared the ACCA’s residual clause unconstitutional.  The parties agree that, pursuant to
<line: 24> Johnson, petitioner’s prior reckless injury conviction no longer qualifies as a violent felony
<line: 25> under the ACCA.  Johnson applies retroactively, Price v. United States, 795 F.3d 731 (7  Cir.
<line: 26> th
<line: 27> 2015), and petitioner has received permission to file a successive motion to vacate his
<line: 28> sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.  The government does not oppose the motion.  

[TEXT]
<line: 30> The parties agree that the court should forego a re-sentencing hearing and simply
<line: 31> impose the maximum sentence of 120 months, concurrent, on each count.  Petitioner further
<line: 32> asks the court to revise his conditions of supervised release to add a 60 day halfway house
<line: 33> condition to ease his adjustment into the community.
