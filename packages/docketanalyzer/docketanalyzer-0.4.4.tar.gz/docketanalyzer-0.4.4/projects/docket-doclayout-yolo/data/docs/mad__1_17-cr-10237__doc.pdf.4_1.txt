<line: 4> AFFIDAVIT OF ROBERT B. FISHER
<line: 5> IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR A CRIMINAL COMPLAINT

[TEXT]
<line: 7> I, Robert B. Fisher, being duly sworn, depose and state the following.

[TITLE]
<line: 9> Preface

[TEXT]
<line: 11> I am a Special Agent of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement
<line: 12> (ICE'), Homeland Security Investigations ("HSI"). I am currently assigned to the Office of the
<line: 13> Special Agent in Charge Boston, Massachusetts, Document and Benefit Fraud Task Force
<line: 14> (DBFTF"), and have been so employed since August 2009. I am a graduate of the Criminal
<line: 15>  Investigator Training Program and the ICE Special Agent Training Program at the Federal Law
<line: 16> Enforcement Training Center (*FLETC") in Glynco, Georgia. I have training and experience in
<line: 17> the enforcement of the Immigration and Nationality Act laws of the United States and am fully
<line: 18> familiar with the statutes applicable to the charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States as it
<line: 19> relates to passport misuse, visa fraud, and immigration benefits to include non-immigrant visa
<line: 20> applications and the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. I have assisted in prior
<line: 21>  investigations involving passport misuse and visa fraud for the purpose of obtaining immigration
<line: 22> and other benefits. I have also received advanced training in identity and benefit fraud at the
<line: 23> FLETC. Prior to becoming an ICE HSI Special Agent, I was employed as an Inspector and
<line: 24> Program Manager with the United States Customs Service for nearly seven (7) years. I received
<line: 25> a Bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice from Stonehill College and a Master's degree in
<line: 26> Homeland Security Leadership from the University of Connecticut.

[TEXT]
<line: 28> 2.
<line: 29> Based upon my training and experience, I know that it is a violation of Title 18 of
<line: 30> the United States Code, Section 371 for two or more persons to conspire to defraud the United
<line: 31> States, here specifically, by conspiring to obstruct the lawful functions of the Department of
<line: 32> Homeland Security ("DHs") to fraudulently obtain F-1 non-immigrant student visas (*F-1
<line: 33> visas"). The conspiracy charged in this complaint involves a foreign national (Test Taker),

<line: 4> entering into an agreement to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language ("TOEFL) exam
<line: 5> in the place of another foreign national ("Beneficiary'). The object of the conspiracy is for the
<line: 6> Beneficiary to be fraudulently awarded a TOEFL score that meets an American college or.
<line: 7> university's minimum entrance requirement, which would facilitate the Beneficiary obtaining an
<line: 8> F-1 visa.

<line: 11> The following affidavit is furnished to support a criminal complaint against Yue.
<line: 12> Wang and Shikun Zhang. Based on the facts contained in this affidavit, I believe there is probable
<line: 13> cause to believe that the above-named individuals have violated 18 U.S.C. $371.

[TEXT]
<line: 15> 4.
<line: 16> The facts herein are based on my involvement in this investigation, a review of.
<line: 17> reports written by other law enforcement officers during this investigation, and my conversations
<line: 18> with those officers. In submitting this affidavit, I have not included every fact known to me
<line: 19> regarding this investigation. Instead, I have included only those facts that I believe are sufficient.
<line: 20> to establish probable cause..

[TITLE]
<line: 22> Background

[TEXT]
<line: 24> 5.
<line: 25> In May 2016, DBFTF opened an investigation regarding possible fraud involving.
<line: 26> Chinese nationals and college admissions exams occurring in the Boston area. The information.
<line: 27> was developed from an investigation by the HSI Philadelphia DBFTF and by information from.
<line: 28> the Educational Testing Service ("ETs"), a nonprofit company that develops, administers, and
<line: 29>  scores various college admissions tests worldwide, including the TOEFL..

[TEXT]
<line: 31>  The TOEFL exam is an English language test recognized by more than 9,000
<line: 32> 6.
<line: 33> colleges, universities, and agencies in more than 130 countries. It is used by the United States
<line: 34> government in issuing, extending, or renewing F-1 visas, and as an entrance requirement for
<line: 35> colleges and universities.

[TEXT]
<line: 37> 7.
<line: 38> An F-1 visa is issued to international students who are attending an academic

<line: 4> program or English Language Program at a United States college or university. The process is
<line: 5> controlled by the DHS's Student and Exchange Visitor Program ("SEVP"), and requires the
<line: 6> international student to take the TOEFL exam and use his/her score to apply for admission to a
<line: 7> SEVP-certified school. Acceptance at these institutions is dependent on, among other factors,
<line: 8> the student achieving the particular school's minimum TOEFL score requirement. If the student
<line: 9> is accepted to a school, the student is issued a Form I-20 by the designated school official. The
<line: 10> Form I-20 is a multi-purpose document issued by a DHS-approved educational institution
<line: 11> certifying that a student has been legitimately admitted to a full-time study program. The student
<line: 12> then uses the I-20 form to apply for a student visa from the United States Department of State.
<line: 13> Once arriving in the United States, the student presents his/her Form I-20 and student visa to the
<line: 14> United States Customs and Border Protection for the purpose of gaining admission to the United
<line: 15> States to attend their respective school.

[TEXT]
<line: 17> 8.
<line: 18> As such, an international student's ability to obtain an F-1 visa depends on his/her
<line: 19> ability to achieve the minimum TOEFL score for admittance to an American college or
<line: 20> university.

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 9..
<line: 23> Based on my training and experience, I know that one method used to obtain such
<line: 24> a minimum TOEFL score is for a Beneficiary who cannot achieve a school's minimum TOEFL
<line: 25> requirement to hire an imposter Test Taker to take the exam in his/her place.

[TEXT]
<line: 27> 10.]
<line: 28> By various means, the Test Taker will be provided access to the Beneficiary's
<line: 29> ETS account (necessary to register for exams, check score results, and send out scores to
<line: 30> colleges) and identification (typically the Beneficiary's international passport), and present that
<line: 31> account information and passport to the ETS official administering the TOEFL exam.

[TEXT]
<line: 33> 11.
<line: 34> When a student arrives for a TOEFL exam, the TOEFL administrator will record
<line: 35> what identification a student uses, and in the case of a passport, note the passport number in the

[TEXT]
<line: 4> ETS registered account associated with that particular student. Additionally, the person who is
<line: 5> physically present for the exam is photographed, and that photograph becomes part of the ETS
<line: 6> record. As such, when a Beneficiary has taken a TOEFL exam legitimately on multiple
<line: 7> occasions, his/her true likeness may be included on the ETS record associated with one or more
<line: 8> exam scores that fail to achieve the minimum TOEFL requirement for the school they currently
<line: 9> attend. The Beneficiaries' ETS record will also include an exam score that does meet their
<line: 10> school's minimum entrance requirement with a different person depicted for that exam.

[TEXT]
<line: 12> 12.
<line: 13>  The Beneficiary agrees to pay the Test Taker or unknown third-parties for the.
<line: 14> Test Taker to take the TOEFL exam for him/her..

[TEXT]
<line: 16> 13.
<line: 17> Underlying this scheme is the DHS' SEVP's interest in not allowing its F-1 visa
<line: 18> program to be exploited by those individuals who have not legitimately earned the right to attend
<line: 19> an American college or university, but gained entry into the United States in part, through this
<line: 20> fraudulent process.

[TITLE]
<line: 22> Investigation

[TEXT]
<line: 24> 14.
<line: 25> Yue Wang ("Wang") is currently an F-1 non-immigrant student from China.
<line: 26> attending the Hult International Business School in Cambridge, MA..

[TEXT]
<line: 28> 15.
<line: 29> In the Spring of 2016, Special Agents from DBFTF and Diplomatic Security
<line: 30> Service - Boston Field Office received information from the HSI Philadelphia DBFTF and ETS
<line: 31> that a person ("YY") intended to impersonate another Chinese national and take an upcoming
<line: 32> TOEFL exam in her place in Boston on May 21, 2016. On that day, YY was removed from the
<line: 33> testing room while taking the exam by an ETS Investigator on suspicion of being an impostor.
<line: 34> YY is also an F-1 non-immigrant student from China attending the Hult International Business
<line: 35> School. After being Mirandized by law enforcement, YY agreed to speak with me and another
<line: 36> law enforcement officer. While under oath, YY admitted to being a paid Test Taker and was in

[TEXT]
<line: 4> possession of a People's Republic of China passport in the identity of ("swC'). YY stated that
<line: 5> her friend and classmate Wang had been contacted by someone in China to take the May 21,
<line: 6> 2016 TOEFL exam on the behalf of SWC, but asked YY to take the TOEFL exam for her. YY
<line: 7> stated that Wang had paid her $100 upfront and had promised her another $800 if she achieved a
<line: 8> score of ninety (90) or better on the TOEFL exam.

[TEXT]
<line: 10> 16.
<line: 11>  On May 24, 2016, I participated in a consensual interview of Wang at her.
<line: 12> residence in Malden, MA. After being Mirandized and while under oath, Wang admitted to
<line: 13> hiring her friend and classmate YY to take a TOEFL exam in her place under the identity of
<line: 14> SwC. Wang also admitted to having been a Test Taker on at least three (3) other occasions but
<line: 15> decided against taking the May 21, 2016, exam for SwC because she read in the news about
<line: 16> entrance exam Test Takers being arrested. Wang was able to recall taking the TOEFL exam for
<line: 17> two women (*LH') and ("XC'). Subsequent research by ETS revealed photos depicting Wang
<line: 18>  under the 2 above-listed names as well as the name Shikun Zhang (Zhang") with TOEFL exam
<line: 19> dates and valid scores in December 2015 (Zhang), and two occasions in March 2016 (LH and
<line: 20> XC).

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 17.
<line: 23>  Wang confirmed that she received genuine Chinese passports either through the.
<line: 24> mail, or on one occasion in person, and used those passports as identification to take TOEFL
<line: 25> exams under those respective identities. I then inspected Wang's phone which revealed: i)
<line: 26> screenshots of ETS account information for LH and XC; ii) photographs of LH's genuine
<line: 27> Chinese passport; and iii) UsPS and FedEx receipts detailing packages being sent between Wang.
<line: 28> and LH. Wang admitted to having been paid nearly $7,000 for taking these TOEFL exams in
<line: 29> place of Zhang, LH, and XC.

[TEXT]
<line: 31> Zhang is currently an F-1 non-immigrant student from China attending.
<line: 32> Northeastern University in Boston, MA.

<line: 4> 19.
<line: 5>  On August 31, 2016, I participated in a consensual interview of Zhang at her
<line: 6> apartment in Boston. After being Mirandized, Zhang admitted that in 2015, she paid $3,000 to
<line: 7> have someone take the TOEFL exam for her. She explained that using a texting service she
<line: 8> contacted an unknown third-party Broker, she believed to reside in China, and was instructed to
<line: 9>  meet a woman in Boston and provide this person with her genuine Chinese passport, which she.
<line: 10> admitted doing.

[TEXT]
<line: 12> 20.
<line: 13>  My review of Northeastern University's admission standards show that
<line: 14> international students who wish to attend Northeastern University must achieve a minimum score
<line: 15> of 92 on the TOEFL exam. My review of the ETS records associated with Zhang revealed that
<line: 16> on November 2, 2014, December 13, 2014, and December 28, 2014, a person sat for the TOEFL
<line: 17> exam and failed to earn a score that met Northeastern's minimum entrance requirement. Further
<line: 18> review of Zhang's ETS account revealed that that on December 4, 2015, a person sat for the.
<line: 19> TOEFL exam and earned a 96, which surpassed Northeastern's minimum entrance requirement

[TEXT]
<line: 21> 21.  Zhang was then shown these ETS records, which included the photographs of the
<line: 22> individual who took the TOFEL exam under her identity on those occasions. Zhang admitted
<line: 23> that the woman depicted on the ETS record associated with the November 2, 2014, December
<line: 24> 13, 2014, and December 28, 2014 TOEFL exams was her. Zhang further admitted that the
<line: 25> woman depicted on the December 4, 2015 TOEFL exam which took place in Boston, MA,
<line: 26> whose TOEFL score she used to gain admission to Northeastern University and obtain an F-1
<line: 27> visa, was not her. The ETS records further showed that for the December 4, 2015 TOEFL exam,.
<line: 28> the person who took the exam under the Zhang identity provided the passport number associated
<line: 29> with Zhang's genuine passport.
