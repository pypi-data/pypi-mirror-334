<line: 25> (1)
<line: 26>  Plaintiff is DIRECTED to show cause by noon on Wednesday,.
<line: 27> September 18, 2019, why the Court should not impose sanctions for plaintiff's failure to
<line: 28> make mandatory disclosures in discovery concerning the actual damages it seeks in this
<line: 29> action. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1)(A)(iii) requires a party to provide,
<line: 30> without awaiting a discovery request, a "computation of each category of damages," and
<line: 31> to make available for inspection and copying *the documents or other evidentiary
<line: 32> material, unless privileged or protected from disclosure, on which each computation is
<line: 33> based." Plaintiff failed to timely comply with Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(iii). Federal Rule of
<line: 34> Civil Procedure 37(c)(1) authorizes the Court to impose appropriate sanctions for
<line: 35> violation of Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(iii), even in the absence of any prior motion by the
<line: 36> opposing party to compel discovery. See Toyrrific, LLC v. Karapetian, 606 Fed. App'x
<line: 37> 365 (9th Cir. 2015). Plaintiff also failed to timely comply with Federal Rule of Civil
<line: 38> Procedure 33. In response to defendants' interrogatory seeking the "factual and legal
<line: 39> basis" for plaintiff's damages, plaintiff indicated merely that it wants "damages sufficient
<line: 40> to compensate [it] for all injury sustained, including the disgorgement of defendants

<line: 22> profits. See Pla.'s Resp. to Interrogatory No. 15 (docket no. 118-2). Plaintiff did not
<line: 23> supplement this response. In August 2018, defendants moved for summary judgment on
<line: 24> the ground that, among other things, plaintiff had produced no evidence of actual
<line: 25> damages. See Defs.' Mot. at 17-18 (docket no. 33). In response to the dispositive
<line: 26> motion, plaintiff presented arguments about the disgorgement of defendants' profits, but
<line: 27> did not mention any of the components of actual damages that it now seeks, namely
<line: 28> diminution in goodwill, lost profits, and/or the expenses of corrective advertising. See
<line: 29> Pla.'s Resp. at 20-21 (docket no. 52). According to defendants, the first time plaintiff
<line: 30> mentioned loss of goodwill and the costs of corrective advertising was during the
<line: 31> telephonic conference held on September 13, 2019, four days after the Pretrial
<line: 32> Conference and the last judicial day before trial. See Defs.' Resp. at 1 (docket no. 116).
<line: 33> Given the procedural history and posture of this case, the Court rejects plaintiff's
<line: 34> suggestion that defendants are somehow precluded from objecting to plaintiff's request
<line: 35> for actual damages by not moving to compel plaintiff to answer Interrogatory No. 15
<line: 36> and/or by not noting under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6) the deposition of
<line: 37> Christopher Legler, who signed the verification for plaintiff's response to Interrogatory
<line: 38> No. 15, see docket no. 118-2, and who, when asked about the subject in his deposition on
<line: 39> July 17, 2018, testified that plaintiff's "damages sufficient to compensate" was "not a
<line: 40> calculable number right now" and that he did not have "a number in front of [him] right
<line: 41> now." Legler Dep. at 65:17-25 (docket no. 115-1). Plaintiff is hereby placed on notice
<line: 42> that the Court considers plaintiff's discovery violations to involve the willfulness, fault,
<line: 43> and/or bad faith required to impose severe sanctions, including precluding the use as
<line: 44> evidence at trial of all materials and testimony that should have been disclosed under
<line: 45> Rules 26(a)(1)(A)(iii) and/or 33, informing the jury about plaintiff's violations of the
<line: 46> Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, striking or dismissing with prejudice plaintiff's prayer
<line: 47> for actual damages, and/or requiring plaintiff to pay defendants the reasonable attorney's
<line: 48> fees and costs caused by plaintiff's and/or its attorneys' conduct. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37;
<line: 49> see also Tablizo v. City of Las Vegas, 720 Fed. App'x 875 (9th Cir. 2018); Jay E. Grenig
<line: 50> & Jeffrey S. Kinsler, HANDBOOK FED. CIV. DISCOVERY & DISCLOSURE j 12:12 (4th ed.
