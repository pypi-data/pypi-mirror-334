<line: 24> (Dismissing 28 U.S.C.  2241 Petition)

[TEXT]
<line: 26> Juleen Brown, a federal inmate proceeding pro se, submitted this Petition for a
<line: 27> Writ of Habeas Corpus ("s 2241 Petition," ECF No. 1.) The matter is before the Court
<line: 28> for preliminary review. See Rule 4, Rules Governing $ 2254 Cases in the U.S. District
<line: 29> Courts ('If it plainly appears from the petition and any attached exhibits that the
<line: 30> petitioner is not entitled to relief in the district court, the judge must dismiss the petition
<line: 31> and direct the clerk to notify the petitioner.).' For the reasons set forth below, the
<line: 32> 8 2241 Petition will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction

<line: 4> States v. Brown, No. 99-7008, 1999 WL 1020772, at *1 (4th Cir. Nov. 10, 1999). In her
<line: 5> 8 2241 Petition, Brown contends that she is entitled to relief because this Court lacked
<line: 6> jurisdiction to prosecute her. As explained below, it is plain under the precedent in the
<line: 7> United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit that Brown may not utilize 28.

[TEXT]
<line: 12> A motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. $ 2255 "provides the primary means of collateral.
<line: 13> attack'" on the imposition of a federal conviction and sentence, and such motion must be
<line: 14> filed with the sentencing court. See Pack v. Yusuff, 218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir. 2000)
<line: 15> (quoting Cox v. Warden, Fed. Det. Ctr., 911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir. 1990). A federal
<line: 16> inmate may not proceed under 28 U.S.C. s 2241 unless he or she demonstrates that the
<line: 17> remedy afforded by 28 U.S.C.  2255 *is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of.
<line: 18> his detention." 28 U.S.C. s 2255(e).? "For example, attacks on the execution of a
<line: 19> sentence are properly raised in a  2241 petition." In re Vial, 115 F.3d 1192, 1194 n.5

<line: 21> Luther, 693 F.2d 629, 632 n.1 (7th Cir. 1982)). Nevertheless, the United States Court of
<line: 22> Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has emphasized that *the remedy afforded by $ 2255 is not
<line: 23> rendered inadequate or ineffective merely because an individual has been unable to.

<line: 8> The Fourth Circuit has stressed that an inmate may proceed under  2241 to
<line: 9> challenge his conviction "in only very limited circumstances." United States v. Poole,
<line: 10> 531 F.3d 263, 269 (4th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).
<line: 11> The "controlling test," id., in the Fourth Circuit is as follows:

[TEXT]
<line: 13> [Section] 2255 is inadequate and ineffective to test the legality of a
<line: 14> conviction when: (1) at the time of conviction, settled law of this circuit or.
<line: 15> the Supreme Court established the legality of the conviction; (2) subsequent
<line: 16> to the prisoner's direct appeal and first  2255 motion, the substantive law
<line: 17> changed such that the conduct of which the prisoner was convicted is.
<line: 18> deemed not to be criminal; and (3)the prisoner cannot satisfy the.
<line: 19> gatekeeping provisions of s 2255 because the new rule is not one of
<line: 20> constitutional law.

[TEXT]
<line: 22> In re Jones, 226 F.3d 328, 333-34 (4th Cir. 2000) (emphasis added). The Fourth Circuit
<line: 23> formulated this test to provide a remedy for the "fundamental defect presented by a
<line: 24> situation in which an individual is incarcerated for conduct that is not criminal but,
<line: 25> through no fault of his [or her] own, [he or she] has no source of redress." Id. at 333 n.3.

<line: 6> distributing crack and conspiring to distribute crack remains a crime.  Accordingly,
<line: 7> Brown's  2241 Petition will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The Court will deny a
