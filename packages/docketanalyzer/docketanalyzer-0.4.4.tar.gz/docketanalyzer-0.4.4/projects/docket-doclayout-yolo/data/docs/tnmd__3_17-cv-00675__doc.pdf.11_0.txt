[TITLE]
<line: 32> REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION 

[TEXT]
<line: 34> This civil action was commenced by the filing of a complaint on April 4, 2017 (Docket 
<line: 35> No. 4), in which Plaintiffs named the following Defendants: Jean Perez (aka Jeannette Perez 
<line: 36> Bolaños aka Jean Perez Delgado aka Jean Rodriguez); Jesus Enrique Bolaños Rangel (aka Kike 
<line: 37> Ranger); Emilio Esteffan Rodriguez; Gestoria Bolaños & Asociados; and, Grupo Aduanal Latino, 
<line: 38> LLC.  Nothing in Plaintiffs’ complaint indicates that any of the named Defendants are foreign 
<line: 39> defendants. Plaintiffs have filed only one return of service of summons, on June 2, 2017 (Docket 
<line: 40> No. 8), indicating service on Defendant Jean Perez by certified mail delivered on April 8, 2017. 

[TEXT]
<line: 42> Under the plain language of Rule 4(m) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, “[i]f a 
<line: 43> defendant is not served within 90 days after the complaint is filed, the court—on motion or on its 
<line: 44> own after notice to the plaintiff—must dismiss the action without prejudice against that defendant 
<line: 45> or order that service be made within a specified time.”  The 90th day after the April 4, 2017 
<line: 46> complaint filing date in this case was July 3, 2017.  There is nothing in the record indicating that 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> any Defendant other than Defendant Jean Perez was ever served with the summons and complaint,
<line: 3> much less by July 3, 2017.

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Plaintiffs were given notice by order entered on July 31, 2017 (Docket No. 10) that, unless.
<line: 6> returns of service of summons on all of the other Defendants were filed by August 14, 2017,
<line: 7> showing that service was timely effected, a recommendation for dismissal of this action as to any.
<line: 8> unserved Defendants would be made. No such returns of service were filed by August 14, 2017.

[TEXT]
<line: 10> Because Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate compliance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m), it is
<line: 11> respectfully recommended that Plaintiffs claims against Defendants Jesus Enrique Bolanos Rangel
<line: 12> (aka Kike Ranger); Emilio Esteffan Rodriguez; Gestoria Bolanos & Asociados, Grupo Aduanal
<line: 13> Latino, LLC be dismissed without prejudice, as provided for in that rule. This recommendation
<line: 14> does not include Plaintiffs' claims against Defendant Jean Perez, as Defendant Perez was at least
<line: 15> ostensibly served, according to the return of service filed by Plaintiffs on June 2, 2017..

[TEXT]
<line: 17> ANY OBJECTIONS to this Report and Recommendation must be filed with the Clerk of.
<line: 18> Court within fourteen (14) days of service of this Report and Recommendation and must state with
<line: 19> particularity the specific portions of this Report and Recommendation to which objection is made..
<line: 20> Failure to file written objections within the specified time can be deemed a waiver of the right to
<line: 21> appeal the District Court's Order regarding the Report and Recommendation. See Thomas v. Arn,
<line: 22> 474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985); United States v. Walters, 638 F.2d 947 (6th
<line: 23> Cir. 1981).
