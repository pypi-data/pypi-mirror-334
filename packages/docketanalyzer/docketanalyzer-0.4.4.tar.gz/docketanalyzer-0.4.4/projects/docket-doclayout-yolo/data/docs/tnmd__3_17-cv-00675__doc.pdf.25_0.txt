[TEXT]
<line: 25> The initial case management conference scheduled for February 7, 2018, was called and 
<line: 26> appearance was made by Joel Sanderson, counsel for Plaintiffs.  No appearance was made by or 
<line: 27> on behalf of Defendant Jean Perez, who is the sole remaining defendant in this case.   

[TEXT]
<line: 29> For the reasons that follow, and subject to further orders, the initial case management 
<line: 30> conference is RESCHEDULED for Thursday, April 19, 2018, at 11:00 a.m., in Courtroom 764, 
<line: 31> U.S. Courthouse, 801 Broadway, Nashville, Tennessee.  On February 6, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a 
<line: 32> motion for default judgment (Docket No. 24) against Defendant Jean Perez.  However, Plaintiff’s 
<line: 33> motion is defective for a number of reasons. Default has not yet been entered under Fed. R. Civ. 
<line: 34> P. 55(a), and Plaintiffs’ motion is not accompanied by an affidavit of service on Defendant Jean 
<line: 35> Perez or certificate of service of the motion.  Nor is there a statement of Defendant Jean Perez’s 
<line: 36> current military status, if any, as required by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.   Additionally, 
<line: 37> no affidavit attesting to the damages claimed by Plaintiffs was provided, and the described 
<line: 38> damages include compensatory and nonpecuniary damages that are not clearly computable to a 
<line: 39> sum certain.

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Based on some or all of these deficiencies, the Court anticipates that the Clerk will deny
<line: 3> the motion for default judgment. Nevertheless, because it does appear that Defendant Jean Perez
<line: 4> has taken no action to defend this case, Plaintiffs may be entitled to default relief, upon appropriate
<line: 5> motions and affidavits. To allow Plaintiffs additional time to properly pursue default relief, the
<line: 6> initial case management conference is rescheduled as provided above. Plaintiffs should promptly
<line: 7> proceed with whatever default relief they seek in this case, and should not wait until days before
<line: 8> the rescheduled case management conference before taking action to bring this case to a
<line: 9> conclusion.

[TEXT]
<line: 11> If Defendant Perez appears in this case, and the case therefore proceeds on its merits, the
<line: 12> parties shall, prior to the rescheduled initial case management conference, confer about and file a.
<line: 13> joint proposed initial case management order by no later than three (3) business days prior to the
<line: 14> rescheduled initial case management conference.

[TEXT]
<line: 16> It is SO ORDERED.
