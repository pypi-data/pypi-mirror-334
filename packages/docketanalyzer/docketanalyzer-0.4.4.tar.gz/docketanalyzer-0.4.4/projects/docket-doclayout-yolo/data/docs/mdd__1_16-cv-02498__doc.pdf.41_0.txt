<line: 21> MEMORANDUM OPINION

[TEXT]
<line: 23> Plaintiffs Ronald J. Schilling, Jr., Russell E. Dolan, Jonathan A. Hecker, Michael
<line: 24> McEwen, Michael Halager, Donald L. Bollinger, and Marcel Hamilton (collectively,
<line: 25> "Plaintiffs'), acting as individuals and on behalf of all similarly situated individuals, have filed
<line: 26> this action against their employer Schmidt Baking Company, Inc. ("Schmidt'), alleging
<line: 27> violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (*FLSA'), 29 U.S.C. $ 201-219 (2012). Plaintiffs
<line: 28> have filed a pre-discovery Motion for Conditional Certification and a Motion for Equitable
<line: 29> Tolling of the Statute of Limitations. Having reviewed the submitted materials, the Court finds
<line: 30> no hearing necessary. D. Md. Local R. 105.6. For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs
<line: 31> Motions are GRANTED.

[TITLE]
<line: 33> BACKGROUND

[TEXT]
<line: 35> Schmidt, a bread production and distribution company based in Baltimore, Maryland.
<line: 36> provides baked goods to various establishments, including restaurants, grocery stores, small

[TEXT]
<line: 2> businesses, schools, prisons, and warehouses, throughout the mid-Atlantic region. Schmidt
<line: 3> employs Plaintiffs and other individuals as District Sales Managers ("DSMs'), whose formal job
<line: 4> description states that their function is to "manage' a particular geographic region in which
<line: 5> Schmidt's products are sold.Compl.  30, ECF No. 1.

[TEXT]
<line: 7> Plaintiffs allege that despite this job description, DSMs' primary duty is to assist a group
<line: 8> of "independent operators"---independent contractors who lease delivery routes and vehicles
<line: 9> from Schmidt in order to deliver Schmidt's products. Id.  31. Because independent operators
<line: 10> are not Schmidt employees, DSMs have no authority over them. The primary way that DSMs
<line: 11> assist independent operators is by filling in for them in driving their delivery routes, which
<line: 12> generally take from 12 to 16 hours to complete. DSMs also fix any mistakes made by.
<line: 13> independent operators, including by retrieving incorrectly delivered products and delivering the
<line: 14> correct ones. DSMs can be called on to take on such duties at any time, including on scheduled
<line: 15> days off and before or after scheduled shifts, including overnight. Due to understaffing, in
<line: 16> addition to assisting those independent operators operating within their own districts, DSMs are
<line: 17> called upon to make deliveries originating in other districts and to correct errors occurring in
<line: 18> those districts. Plaintiffs allege that, all told, they spend between 65 and 85 percent of their time
<line: 19> each week making deliveries. Due to the limited number of delivery vehicles at each distribution
<line: 20> center, DSMs use their personal vehicles to complete these deliveries approximately 90 percent
<line: 21> of the time

[TEXT]
<line: 23> DSMs spend the remainder of their time performing clerical duties, manual labor around
<line: 24> Schmidt's warehouses, and work at customers' stores. Their clerical duties include routine
<line: 25> office work such as collecting receipts for transactions, checking the status of current orders,
<line: 26> monitoring order adjustments, and responding to calls regarding the status of deliveries. DSMs

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> are expected to respond to calls and emails whenever an issue arises, even when they are off-.
<line: 3> duty. Their manual labor includes unloading products from delivery trucks, cleaning.
<line: 4> warehouses, and applying labels to products. Their work at customers' stores includes
<line: 5> rearranging and stocking Schmidt's products on customers' shelves, retrieving stale or unused
<line: 6> products, and completing one or two "product resets' per store each year, which may include
<line: 7> changes ranging from replacing signs to constructing aisle displays. Id.  65.

[TEXT]
<line: 9> According to Plaintiffs, DSMs have no discretion in completing these tasks. They.
<line: 10> operate at the direction of Schmidt's Branch Managers, who are their direct supervisors, and
<line: 11> Area Sales Managers. Because DSMs are salaried employees paid weekly, they receive the same
<line: 12> salary regardless of how many hours they actually work. Although DSMs such as Plaintiffs are
<line: 13> scheduled to work between approximately 45 and 54 hours per week, because they are expected
<line: 14> to perform job functions even during their scheduled time off, they consistently worked between
<line: 15> 70 and 85 hours per week, sometimes working more than 100 hours over a seven-day work
<line: 16> week.

[TEXT]
<line: 18> On July 6, 2016, Plaintiffs Schilling, Dolan, and Hecker filed this action on behalf of all
<line: 19> DSMs, alleging that Schmidt has unlawfully failed to pay them overtime wages. Plaintiffs
<line: 20> brought the case as both a collective action pursuant to the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. $ 216(b), and a
<line: 21> class action pursuant to Maryland state wage laws. On July 27, 2016, Schmidt filed a Motion to
<line: 22> Dismiss and for Summary Judgment. On September 23, 2016, the Court (Motz, J.), construing
<line: 23> the motion as a Motion to Dismiss, granted it. Plaintiffs appealed that ruling. On November 17,
<line: 24> 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of
<line: 25> Plaintiffs' state law claims but reversed the dismissal of the FLSA claim. Upon remand,
<line: 26> Plaintiffs McEwen, Halager, Bollinger, and Hamilton joined the case as named Plaintiffs. On

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> February 26, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Conditional Certification, asking the Court to
<line: 3> conditionally certify an FLSA collective action on behalf of all Schmidt DSMs and to assist them
<line: 4> in identifying and notifying DSMs who are not currently parties to the Complaint. That same
<line: 5> day, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Equitable Tolling of the Statute of Limitations, asking the Court
<line: 6>  to toll the deadline for a putative class member to file an FLSA claim during the period from July
<line: 7> 27, 2016, the date on which Schmidt filed its Motion to Dismiss and for Summary Judgment, to
<line: 8> the date the Court rules on the Motion for Conditional Certification.

<line: 10> DISCUSSION

[TITLE]
<line: 12>  Motion for Conditional Certification
<line: 13> I.

[TITLE]
<line: 15> A.
<line: 16> Legal Standard

[TEXT]
<line: 18> The FLSA generally requires that employees who work more than 40 hours in a week
<line: 19> receive overtime pay at the rate of one and one-half times their regular pay rate. See 29 U.S.C. 
<line: 20> 207(a). If an employer violates these rules, employees may sue their employers as individuals
<line: 21> or, if they choose, in a collective action on behalf of themselves and "similarly situated'
<line: 22> employees. 29 U.S.C. $ 216(b); see Simmons v. United Mortg. & Loan Inv., LLC, 634 F.3d 754,
<line: 23> 758 (4th Cir. 2011). If employees choose to pursue a collective action, they may seek court-
<line: 24> approved notice to inform similarly situated employees that they may join the litigation. See
<line: 25> Hoffman-La Roche v. Sperling, 493 U.S. 164, 169 (1989) (discussing the parallel collective
<line: 26> action provision under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act).

[TEXT]
<line: 28> The collective action provision serves several purposes. First, collective actions allow
<line: 29> plaintiffs *the advantage of lower individual costs to vindicate rights by the pooling of
<line: 30> resources." See id at 170. Second, collective actions allow the courts efficiently to resolve
<line: 31> common issues in one proceeding. See id. Third, FLSA collective actions promote enforcement

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> of the law by empowering employees to *join in their litigation so that no one of them need stand
<line: 3> alone in doing something likely to incur the displeasure of an employer." See Pentland v. Dravo
<line: 4> Corp., 152 F.2d 851, 853 (3d Cir. 1945).

[TEXT]
<line: 6> Although the Fourth Circuit has not provided specific guidance on how to address a
<line: 7> motion for conditional certification of an FLSA collective action, decisions from other Courts of
<line: 8> Appeals have identified, and judges of the United States District Court for the District of
<line: 9> Maryland generally apply, a two-step process to test the sufficiency of the purported class: (1) a
<line: 10> pre-discovery determination that the purported class is similarly situated enough to disseminate
<line: 11> notice (the "notice stage') and (2) a post-discovery determination, typically in response to a
<line: 12> motion for decertification, that the purported class is indeed similarly situated. See, e.g.,
<line: 13> Thiessen v. General Electric Capital Corp., 267 F.3d 1095, 1102 (10th Cir. 2001); Hipp v.
<line: 14> Liberty Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 252 F.3d 1208, 1218-19 (11th Cir. 2001); Mooney v. Aramco, 54 F.3d
<line: 15> 1207, 1213-14 (5th Cir. 1995); Randolph v. Powercomm Constr., Inc., 7 F. Supp. 3d 561, 575
<line: 16> (D. Md. 2014); Syrja v. Westat, Inc., 756 F.Supp.2d 682, 686 (D. Md. 2010). At the notice stage,
<line: 17> courts applying this process make a threshold determination whether the class is similarly
<line: 18> situated based on "substantial allegations"' in the pleadings and any submitted affidavits or
<line: 19> declarations. See Thiessen, 267 F.3d at 1102. Then, once discovery is largely completed, such
<line: 20> courts perform a more stringent inquiry into whether the class is indeed similarly situated.
<line: 21> Mooney, 54 F.3d at 1214.

[TEXT]
<line: 23> Because the record is sparse at the notice stage, courts often apply "a fairly lenient
<line: 24> standard." Id.; Hipp, 252 F.3d at 1218 (noting that courts use a "fairly lenient standard" that
<line: 25> 'typically results in *conditional certification'" at the notice stage); Randolph, 7 F. Supp. 3d at
<line: 26> 575-76. Thus, courts require no more than "substantial allegations that the putative class

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> members were together the victims of a single decision, policy, or plan." Thiessen, 267 F.3d at
<line: 3> 1102 (citations omitted); Randolph, 7 F.Supp.3d at 575-76. Although vague allegations with
<line: 4> meager factual support are generally insufficient to certify a class, proponents of conditional
<line: 5> class certification need not conclusively demonstrate that a class of similarly situated plaintiffs
<line: 6> exists. See Randolph, 7 F. Supp. 3d at 576; Syrja, 756 F. Supp. 2d at 686-(requiring "relatively
<line: 7> modest" evidence that the putative class members are similarly situated)

[TEXT]
<line: 9> This Court will apply the two-step process because a modest inquiry into the propriety of.
<line: 10> conditional class certification before issuing court-approved notice is consistent with the
<line: 11> purposes of the FLSA collective action provision. Certainly, some threshold inquiry before
<line: 12> issuing notice to potential class members is appropriate to ensure that notice is not subject to
<line: 13> misuse and is "timely, accurate, and informative." See Hoffman-La Roche, 493 U.S. at 171-72
<line: 14> But it is equally important that the inquiry occur under a lenient standard to be consistent with
<line: 15> the FLSA's purposes of promoting efficient joint adjudication of claims, lowering the costs of
<line: 16> litigation to employee plaintiffs, and accounting for employees' natural reluctance to challenge
<line: 17> an employer. See id. at 170; Pentland, 152 F.2d at 853..

[TEXT]
<line: 19> Finally, because all employees who join an FLSA collective action, unlike a class action
<line: 20> under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, must affirmatively opt into the litigation as plaintiffs,
<line: 21> see Simmons v. United Mortg. & Loan Inv., LLC, 634 F.2d 754, 758 (4th Cir. 2011), it would be
<line: 22> unfair to impose an initial barrier significantly more stringent than the one imposed on ordinary
<line: 23> plaintiffs seeking to join a litigation under Rule 20. For these reasons, the Court will apply the
<line: 24> two-step process and the lenient standard at the notice stage..

<line: 2> B.
<line: 3> Conditional Certification

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Here, the Court finds that the members of the putative class are sufficiently similarly.
<line: 6> situated to warrant conditional certification and notice. The Complaint alleges that DSMs are all
<line: 7> salaried employees who perform the same job functions. Specifically, DSMs lack supervisory
<line: 8> authority, and their actual job duties include making deliveries in place of independent operators,
<line: 9> performing clerical duties, engaging in manual labor around Schmidt's warehouses, and working
<line: 10> at customers' stores. DSMs consistently work more than 40 hours per week, but they are.
<line: 11> compensated with a weekly salary and thus do not receive overtime pay. They remain on call
<line: 12> and frequently receive assignments outside of their standard work hours. Plaintiffs have
<line: 13> submitted five affidavits from DSMs attesting to these facts.

[TEXT]
<line: 15> This limited factual showing is more than sufficient to satisfy the lenient standard at this
<line: 16> stage. For example, in Butler v. DirectSAT USA, LLC, 876 F. Supp. 2d 560 (D. Md. 2012), the
<line: 17> court certified an FLSA collective action of technicians who installed DirecTV equipment based
<line: 18> on the finding that the plaintiffs had "made a modest factual showing that they are similarly
<line: 19> situated to other technicians based out of the Waldorf and Beltsville warehouses during the last.
<line: 20> three years," because "technicians in these warehouses were all subject to the same . . . company
<line: 21> policies and procedures, and . . . they followed the same timekeeping policies and practices and
<line: 22> same compensation plan," "they typically worked in excess of sixty hours per week but were not.
<line: 23> compensated for all of this time," and "warehouse managers and supervisors instructed [them].
<line: 24> not to record any overtime hours on [their] timesheets even though [they] routinely worked in
<line: 25> excess of forty hours in a given week." Id. at 568 (internal citations omitted). Other cases in this
<line: 26> District have likewise resulted in certification of a collective action under similar circumstances..
<line: 27> See, e.g., Desmond v. Alliance, Inc., No. CCB-14-3499, 2015 WL 2165115, at *3 (D. Md. May

<line: 3> showing that they are similarly situated to other Coordinators and Leads. The plaintiffs' detailed
<line: 4> declarations suggest they performed the same job duties, and explain how overwork and
<line: 5> understaffing caused them to work more than 40 hours per week."); Yeibyo v. E-Park of EC, Inc.,
<line: 6> No. DKC 2007-1919, 2008 WL 182502, at *8 (D. Md. Jan. 18, 2008) ("[U]nder the fairly lenient

<line: 8> because "each named plaintiff in this case asserts a common claim; i.e., that Defendants violated
<line: 9> the FLSA by failing to compensate him with overtime wages for his work as a parking
<line: 10> attendant.").

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Schmidt argues that conditional certification is inappropriate because the precise amount
<line: 13> of time each DSM spends engaging in particular duties varies based upon the needs of the
<line: 14> specific independent operators and establishments to which the DSM is assigned. Any such
<line: 15> variance is of little concern at this early stage. To warrant conditional certification, class
<line: 16> members' positions "need not be identical, only similar." Robinson v. Empire Equity Group,
<line: 17> Inc., No. WDQ-09-1603, 2009 WL 4018560, at *2 (D. Md. Nov. 18, 2009) (quoting Yeibyo,.
<line: 18> 2008 wL 182502, at *7)); see Desmond, 2015 WL 2165115, at *3 (citing Robinson). At this
<line: 19> point, the allegations of similarity set forth in the Complaint and Plaintiffs' affidavits are.
<line: 20> sufficient. To the extent that Schmidt argues that individualized inquiries into each DSMs'
<line: 21> actual duties are necessary to assess whether any DsMs are subject to the administrative.
<line: 22> exemption to the FLSA's overtime requirements, the potential that certain DSMs are not eligible
<line: 23> for FLSA overtime is a merits-based question that need not be resolved at this stage. See Essame
<line: 24> v. SSC Laurel Operating Company LLC, 847 F. Supp. 2d 821, 826 (D. Md. 2012).

<line: 26> 8

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Nor does the Motor Carrier Act ("MCA') exemption to the FLSA, or the Fourth Circuit's.
<line: 3> prior ruling regarding that exception, alter the Court's analysis. Schmidt argues that based on the
<line: 4> Fourth Circuit's ruling on the prior appeal in this case, DSMs are not similarly situated because.
<line: 5> some are exempt from FLSA overtime requirements under the MCA exemption, but others are
<line: 6> not, depending on the number of hours the DSM spends driving light vehicles as part of their
<line: 7> duties. The MCA exemption generally provides that the FLSA's overtime requirements do not
<line: 8> apply to *"any employee with respect to whom the Secretary of Transportation has the power to
<line: 9> establish qualifications and maximum hours of service." 29 U.S.C.  213(b)(1). Because the
<line: 10> Secretary of Transportation has authority to regulate the employees of "motor carriers," see 49
<line: 11> U.S.C.  31502(b) (2012), Schmidt's employees engaged in activities affecting vehicles used to
<line: 12> transport property in interstate commerce on public highways would normally be exempt from
<line: 13> the FLSA's overtime-wage requirements. However, the SAFETEA-LU Technical Corrections
<line: 14> Act of 2008 ("TCA"), Pub. L. No. 110-244 $ 306(a), 122 Stat. 1572, 1620 (2008), provides that
<line: 15> the FLSA's overtime-wage requirements nevertheless apply to any "covered employee." Id. S.
<line: 16> 306(a). A "covered employee" includes, as relevant here, "an individual"':

[TEXT]
<line: 18> (1)
<line: 19> who is employed by a motor carrier . . . ;
<line: 20> (2)
<line: 21> whose work, in whole or in part, is defined---

[TEXT]
<line: 23> (A)
<line: 24>  as that of a driver, driver's helper, loader, or mechanic; and
<line: 25> (B)
<line: 26> as affecting the safety of operation of motor vehicles weighing
<line: 27> 10,000 pounds or less in transportation on public highways in
<line: 28> interstate or foreign commerce . . .; and

[TEXT]
<line: 30> (3)
<line: 31> who performs duties on motor vehicles weighing 10,000 pounds or less.

[TEXT]
<line: 33> Id. 3 306(c) (emphasis added). Applying this statutory framework, the Fourth Circuit held that
<line: 34> Schmidt's DSMs are "covered employees" "entitled to FLSA overtime wages for hours worked

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> in excess of 40 hours per week" because they spend *the majority of their working hours making
<line: 3> deliveries"' and because "between 70% and 90% of their delivery trips [a]re made on vehicles
<line: 4> indisputably weighing less than 10,000 pounds." Schilling v. Schmidt Baking Co., Inc., 876 F.3d
<line: 5> 596, 602-03 (4th Cir. 2017).

[TEXT]
<line: 7> Schmidt argues that a DSM is only a "covered employee," and therefore subject to the.
<line: 8> FLSA overtime requirements, during those weeks when the employee has driven vehicles for.
<line: 9> work weighing less than 10,000 pounds.  Schmidt asserts that because DSMs necessarily spend
<line: 10> different amounts of time making deliveries in their personal vehicles each week, individualized
<line: 11> determinations would be required to assess whether and for what time periods DSMs are covered
<line: 12> employees, such that they are not similarly situated. This argument is unavailing for. two
<line: 13> reasons. First, and most significantly, the Fourth Circuit's ruling does not require this Court to
<line: 14> assess each Plaintiff's status as a covered employee on a week-to-week basis. In the appeal, the
<line: 15> Fourth Circuit rejected Schmidt's argument that its employees are not "covered employees" if.
<line: 16> they spend more than a de minimis amount of time operating large vehicles. Schilling, 876 F.3d
<line: 17> at 600. Instead, the court held that because the definition of a covered employee includes
<line: 18> someone "whose work, in whole or in part' affects the safety of vehicle weighing 10,000 pounds
<line: 19> or less, the fact that the DSMs spent a "substantial percentage of time" driving small vehicles
<line: 20> was sufficient for them to be deemed covered employees, without defining any minimum
<line: 21> percentage of time. Id. at 600, 603 & n.5. Significantly, the Fourth Circuit held, without.
<line: 22> qualification, that plaintiffs "[a]re entitled to FLSA overtime wages for hours worked in excess.
<line: 23> of 40 hours per week. Schilling, 876 F.3d at 602. Nothing in the opinion suggests that a.
<line: 24> DSM's status as a covered employee is based on meeting any particular threshold of work on
<line: 25> small vehicles during any given week.

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 10

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Second, by its plain text, the TCA exception applies to employees based on their job
<line: 3> duties, not based on their actual work performed each week. See Pub. L. No. 110-244 $ 306(c),
<line: 4> 122 Stat. 1572, 1621 (stating that a "covered employee' is "any employee . . . whose work, in
<line: 5> whole or in part, is defined. . . as affecting the safety of operation of motor vehicles weighing
<line: 6> 10,000 pounds or less") (emphasis added). The requirement that an employee "performs duties
<line: 7> on motor vehicles weighing 10,000 pounds or less," id. $ 306(c)(3), provides no specific time
<line: 8> period, whether a week or longer, during which such activities must occur. Particularly where
<line: 9> the FLSA is a remedial statute for which exemptions should be narrowly construed, see
<line: 10> Schilling, 876 F.3d at 602, the Court declines to read into the statute a limitation unsupported by
<line: 11> its plain language.

[TEXT]
<line: 13> Schmidt's argument therefore rests solely on a 2010 United States Department of Labor
<line: 14> (DOL') Field Assistance Bulletin interpreting the TCA to provide that "overtime pay
<line: 15> requirements apply to an employee of a motor carrier . . . in any workweek in which the
<line: 16> employee works 'in whole'or in part,' as a driver . . . affecting the safety of operation of small
<line: 17> vehicles on public highways in interstate or foreign commerce." Wage and Hour Division, U.S.

<line: 19> https://www.dol.gov/whd/FieldBulletins/fab2010_2.htm (emphasis added). The Bulletin is not a

<line: 7> L. Ed. 124 (1944), but only to the extent those interpretations have the power to persuade."*
<line: 8> Christensen, 529 U.S. at 587. Where it appears to conflict with the text of the statute, and it.
<line: 9> predates the Fourth Circuit's ruling in Schilling which contemplates no such limitation, the
<line: 10> Bulletin's guidance is not persuasive.

[TEXT]
<line: 12> For purposes of resolving the present motion, however, the Court need not decide
<line: 13> whether a DSM is a "covered employee" only for specific weeks in which the employee worked
<line: 14> on light vehicles. Even if such a limitation applies, that would not provide a basis to deny
<line: 15> collective certification at this time. Plaintiffs' allegations, fairly construed, assert that all DSMs
<line: 16> conducted deliveries on light vehicles to a substantial degree. If any particular DSM did not.
<line: 17> work on a light vehicle during a given week, that would not change the fact that the DSM was a
<line: 18> "covered employee"' for at least some period of employment and is thus similarly situated to
<line: 19> Plaintiffs. Regardless of the number of weeks of overtime pay to which a DSM would ultimately
<line: 20> be entitled as damages, they are similarly situated because the core question whether DSMs are
<line: 21> actually managers subject to the administrative exemption of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C.  213(a)(1), is
<line: 22> common to all DSMs and is most appropriately answered on a collective basis.

[TEXT]
<line: 24> To the extent that individualized assessments may need to be made to determine whether.
<line: 25> there are weeks for which a particular DSM is not entitled to overtime pay, such findings do not
<line: 26> justify denying conditional certification under the lenient standard. See Dunkel v. Warrior

<line: 2> Energy Services, Inc., 304 F.R.D. 193, 201 (W.D. Pa. 2014) ("[W]hile it may turn out to be true
<line: 3> that the exact determination of uncompensated overtime hours will require the Court to make
<line: 4> individual assessments of how often each employee drove the smaller vehicles . . . and in which
<line: 5> work weeks, it would be inappropriate to deny conditional 'certification' now on that basis.").
<line: 6> Notably, in the cases cited by Schmidt in which courts have favorably cited the 2010 DOL
<line: 7> Bulletin, the court had granted conditional certification of a collective action and considered the
<line: 8> Bulletin later in the case, on the issue of class certification under Rule 23 or on summary
<line: 9> judgment. See, e.g., Moore v. Performance Pressure Pumping Services, LLC, No. 5:15-cv--432--
<line: 10> RCL, 2017 WL 1501436, at *2, *13 (W.D. Tex. Apr. 26, 2017) (denying plaintiffs' motion for
<line: 11> summary judgment, because "questions of material fact remain as to whether defendants are
<line: 12> entitled to any exemption under the FLSA," after granting a motion for conditional certification);
<line: 13> Cooper v. Noble Casing, Inc., No. 15-cv-1907-wJMCBS, 2016 WL 6525740, at *1 (D. Colo.
<line: 14> Nov. 3, 2016) (denying a motion for class certification under Rule 23 after granting motion for
<line: 15> conditional certification). If discovery reveals that some or all DSMs, in fact, do not drive light
<line: 16> trucks or their personal vehicles at all, Schmidt can re-assert its argument that the DSMs are not
<line: 17> similarly situated in a post-discovery Motion for Decertification.  See Dunkel, 304 F.R.D. at
<line: 18> 202.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> Finally, the Court finds unpersuasive Schmidt's argument that certification is.
<line: 21> inappropriate because a determination whether DSMs are subject to the TCA exception requires
<line: 22> an individualized assessment whether each DSM actually drove vehicles in interstate commerce
<line: 23> in each workweek. The MCA exemption, by its own terms, would only exempt an employee
<line: 24> from FLSA overtime-wage requirements if that employee worked on vehicles engaged in
<line: 25> interstate commerce. See 29 U.S.C. $ 213(b)(1); 49 U.S.C. $$ 13501-02, 501, 31502(a). Thus,

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 13

[TEXT]
<line: 2> a finding that a DSM did not work on vehicles engaged in interstate commerce would not exempt
<line: 3> that employee from the FLSA.

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Thus, the Court finds that, at this stage, Plaintiffs' allegations that the DSMs are similarly
<line: 6> situated are sufficient. Therefore, the Court will conditionally certify the collective action and
<line: 7> will facilitate notice to those DSMs who are not currently parties to the Complaint.

[TITLE]
<line: 9> C.
<line: 10> Notice

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Having conditionally certified the collective action, the Court will authorize the provision.
<line: 13> of notice to members of the putative class. Although Plaintiffs request certain specific rulings
<line: 14> relating to notice, such as authorization to post a notice at Schmidt and to use a webpage,
<line: 15> Schmidt requests an opportunity to discuss the form of notice with Plaintiffs. Because the
<line: 16> arguments for and against specific notice provisions have yet to be fully articulated, and the
<line: 17> parties may reach a resolution of some or all of the disputes relating to notice, the Court will
<line: 18> decline to issue an order on the specific form or forms of notice and will instead require the
<line: 19> parties to meet and confer and submit a comprehensive, joint proposal regarding notice within 15
<line: 20> days.

[TITLE]
<line: 22> II.
<line: 23>  Motion for Equitable Tolling

[TEXT]
<line: 25> FLSA claims are subject to a two-year statute of limitations, which is extended to three
<line: 26> years for willful violations. 29 U.S.C.  255(a). An individual employee is not deemed to have
<line: 27> filed an FLSA action until the date that employee consents in writing to join the collective
<line: 28> action. 29 U.S.C.  256(b). With only seven named Plaintiffs having joined the collective action
<line: 29> since the filing of the case in 2016, and delay in the case resulting from the earlier appeal.
<line: 30> Plaintiffs ask the Court to toll the statute of limitations on behalf of those putative class members

[ABANDON]
<line: 32> 14

[TEXT]
<line: 2> who would otherwise be barred from asserting FLSA claims for some or all of the time period of
<line: 3> alleged violations.

[TEXT]
<line: 5> The Fourth Circuit has described equitable tolling as "a discretionary doctrine that turns
<line: 6> on the facts and circumstances of a particular case [and] does not lend itself to bright-line rules."
<line: 7> Harris v. Hutchinson, 209 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir. 2000) (quoting Fisher v. Johnson, 174 F.3d
<line: 8> 710, 713 (5th Cir. 1999)). "[A]ny invocation of equity to relieve the strict application of a statute
<line: 9> of limitations must be guarded and infrequent, lest circumstances of individualized hardship.
<line: 10> supplant the rules of clearly drafted statutes." Harris, 209 F.3d at 330. Generally, equitable
<line: 11> tolling is available when (1) "the plaintiffs were prevented from asserting their claims by some
<line: 12> kind of wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant," or (2) "extraordinary circumstances
<line: 13> beyond plaintiffs' control made it impossible to file the claims on time." Cruz v. Maypa, 773
<line: 14> F.3d 138, 146 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting Harris, 209 F.3d at 330).

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Plaintiffs argue that both of these circumstances are present here. Specifically, Plaintiffs
<line: 17> argue that equitable tolling is justified by the extraordinary delay in this case arising from the
<line: 18> dismissal of the FLSA claims and the reversal of that dismissal on appeal, which prevented
<line: 19> putative class members from asserting their claims in a timely manner. They also assert that.
<line: 20> Schmidt engaged in wrongful conduct, consisting of a threat by a Schmidt Vice President that.
<line: 21> putative class members should not join the collective action, which warrants equitable tolling.

[TEXT]
<line: 23> The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the unique circumstances of this case warrant
<line: 24> equitable tolling. Generally, ordinary litigation delay is not considered an "extraordinary
<line: 25> circumstance" warranting equitable tolling. See, e.g., Sandoz v. Cingular Wireless, LLC, 7o0 F.
<line: 26> App'x 317, 321 (5th Cir. 2017); LaFleur v. Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., No. 2:12-cv-00363, 2012
<line: 27> WL 4739534, at *5 (E.D. Va. Oct. 2, 2012); MacGregor v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, No. 2:10-

[TEXT]
<line: 2> CV-03088, 2011 WL 2731227, at *2 (D.S.C. Jul. 13, 2011), Here, however, Plaintiffs' FLSA
<line: 3> claim was dismissed on September 23, 2016, the Fourth Circuit reversed that dismissal on.
<line: 4> November 17, 2017, and the mandate on that reversal was issued on December 11, 2017. In the
<line: 5> interim, no putative class member would have had reason to believe that the claim was.
<line: 6> meritorious and worthy of the risk of joining the collective action. Where the ruling of the.
<line: 7> district court. which was later adjudged to be incorrect, caused a delay of approximately 15
<line: 8> months, accounting for more than half the limitations period, the Court finds an "extraordinary''
<line: 9> circumstance that by itself warrants equitable tolling. See Jackson v. Bloomberg, L.P., 298
<line: 10> F.R.D. 152, 171 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (granting equitable tolling during the nine-month period during
<line: 11> which a motion for conditional certification of a collective action was pending). Cf. Nedds v.
<line: 12> Calderon, 678 F.3d 777, 782 (9th Cir. 2012) (finding, in the habeas context, that good-faith
<line: 13> reliance upon later-overturned circuit precedent was an extraordinary circumstance warranting
<line: 14> equitable tolling).

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Furthermore, Plaintiffs have introduced an affidavit stating that in August 2016, shortly.
<line: 17> after the filing of the Complaint, a Vice President of Schmidt told a group of more than a dozen
<line: 18> DSMs that he "better not find out any of you joined this lawsuit." McEwen Aff.  5, ECF No..
<line: 19> 26-8. The Schmidt Vice President denies making such a threat. Although such a threat, if made,
<line: 20> could constitute wrongful conduct warranting equitable tolling, resolution of this factual dispute
<line: 21> would be time consuming and is unnecessary at this time. The reality is that, whether or not an
<line: 22> overt threat was made, any DSM who wished to continue working at Schmidt would have risked.
<line: 23> antagonizing his or her employer by asserting an FLSA claim. Next to this risk stood a.
<line: 24> possibility of reward that, once the district court had dismissed the case, appeared remote, at.
<line: 25> best, until the dismissal was overturned by the Fourth Circuit over a year later. Under the.

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 16

[TEXT]
<line: 2> specific facts of this case, putative class members could not realistically have been expected to
<line: 3> assert their FLSA claim in a timely manner..

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Schmidt notes that some courts have declined to grant equitable tolling to putative.
<line: 6> members of an FLSA collective action, whether because counsel for the named plaintiffs do not
<line: 7> actually represent those individuals or because the court cannot assess the diligence of unknown
<line: 8> individuals. See, e.g., Atkinson v. Teletech Holdings, Inc., No. 3:14-cv-253, 2015 wL 853234, at
<line: 9> *8 (S.D. Ohio Feb. 26, 2015); In re Amazon.com, Inc., Fulfillment Center Fair Labor Standards
<line: 10> Act and Wage and Hour Litigation, MDL No. 2504, 2014 WL 3695750, at *3 (W.D. Ky. Jul. 24,
<line: 11> 2014). However, the vast majority of courts have allowed named plaintiffs to request such relief.
<line: 12> See, e.g., Chime v. Peak Security Plus, Inc., 137 F. Supp. 3d 183, 188, 204-05 (E.D.N.Y. 2015);
<line: 13> Jackson v. Bloomberg, L.P., 298 F.R.D. 152, 171 (S.D.N.Y. 2014); Struck v. PNC Bank, 931 F.
<line: 14> Supp. 2d 842, 849 (S.D. Ohio 2013); Stransky v. HealthONE of Denver, Inc., 868 F. Supp. 2d
<line: 15> 1178, 1181-82 (D. Colo. Jun. 14, 2012); Putnam v. Galaxy 1 Marketing, Inc., 276 F.R.D. 264,
<line: 16> 276 (S.D. Iowa 2011). In the Court's view, the majority approach is appropriate when applying
<line: 17> a doctrine grounded in equity.

[TEXT]
<line: 19> Where individuals have a potentially meritorious FLSA claim, but are prevented from
<line: 20> asserting that claim by extraordinary circumstances not of their own making, the proper course is
<line: 21> to toll the statute of limitations to allow adjudication of their claim on the merits. Accordingly.
<line: 22> the Court will Grant Plaintiffs' Motion for Equitable Tolling. The statute of limitations will be
<line: 23> tolled from July 27, 2016 until the date notice is disseminated..
