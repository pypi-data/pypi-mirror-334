[TEXT]
<line: 29> Plaintiffs filed the above-captioned action in this Court on April 17, 2017. (Doc. 1.) There
<line: 30> is no indication Plaintiffs properly effected (or even attempted to effectuate) service on any.
<line: 31> Defendant, and more than 90 days have elapsed since the filing of the Complaint. In fact, Plaintiffs
<line: 32> have taken no action in this case since filing their Complaint more than one year ago.

[TEXT]
<line: 34> Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 4(m), where the plaintiff fails to serve a
<line: 35> defendant within 90 days after the complaint is filed, the court-on motion or on its own after
<line: 36> notice to the plaintiff-must dismiss the action or order that service be made within a specified
<line: 37> time. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m). A plaintiff, however, may obtain an extension of time for service of.
<line: 38> process upon the showing of good cause. Id. The plaintiff has the burden of demonstrating the.
<line: 39> existence of "good cause" justifying service outside of the deadline. Sanders v. Fluor Daniel, Inc.

[TEXT]
<line: 2> 151 F.R.D. 138, 139 (M.D. Fla. 1993). "To demonstrate good cause, the plaintiff must offer
<line: 3> evidence that she (1) has proceeded in good faith; (2) has a reasonable basis for noncompliance
<line: 4> and (3) the basis for the delay was more than simple inadvertence or mistake." Durgin v. Mon,
<line: 5> 659 F. Supp. 2d 1240, 1258 (S.D. Fla. 2009), aff'd, 415 F. App'x 161 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam)
<line: 6> (citing Sanders, 151 F.R.D. at 139; Prisco v. Frank, 929 F.2d 603, 604 (11th Cir. 1991);
<line: 7> Horenkamp v. Van Winkle & Co., 402 F.3d 1129, 1130-31 (11th Cir. 2005)).

[TEXT]
<line: 9> Accordingly, the Court HEREBY ORDERS Plaintiffs to show cause, in writing, within
<line: 10> fourteen (14) days from the date of this Order why they have not timely served Defendants within
<line: 11> 90 days as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m). Should Plaintiffs fail to timely
<line: 12> respond and establish such good cause, the Court will presume that Plaintiffs do not intend to
<line: 13> pursue this action and will dismiss this case without prejudice.
