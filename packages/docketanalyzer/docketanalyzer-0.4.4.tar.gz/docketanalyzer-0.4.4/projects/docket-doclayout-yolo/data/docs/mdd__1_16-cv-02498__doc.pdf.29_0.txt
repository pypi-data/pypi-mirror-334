[TITLE]
<line: 43> Introduction and Procedural History

[TEXT]
<line: 45> Plaintiffs Ronald J. Schilling, Russell E. Dolan and Jonathan A. Hecker filed this action
<line: 46> against Schmidt on July 6, 2016, alleging that in formerly working as District Sales Managers
<line: 47> (“DSMs”) for Schmidt, they had been denied overtime pay in violation
<line: 48> of the Fair Labor
<line: 49> Standards Act (“FLSA”), the Maryland Wage and Hour Law (“MWHL”), and the Maryland
<line: 50> Wage Payment and Collection Act (“MWPCA”). The case was brought on behalf of themselves
<line: 51> and a class of other DSMs under both 29 U.S.C. § 216 and Rule 23 F. R. C P. On July 27, 2016,
<line: 52> Schmidt moved to dismiss or for summary judgment. Schmidt contended that because Plaintiffs
<line: 53> claimed regularly to have performed delivery work in their positions, they were not entitled to
<line: 54> overtime pay by virtue of the Motor Carrier Act (“MCA”) exemption to both the FLSA as well
<line: 55> as to the MWH.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> On September 23, 2016, Judge Motz granted the motion, and Plaintiffs appealed.
<line: 5> On
<line: 6> November 17, 2017, the Fourth Circuit affirmed in part and vacated in part. The Fourth Circuit
<line: 7> affirmed the dismissal of Plaintiffs’ claims under state law and vacated Judge Motz dismissal of
<line: 8> the FLSA claims. No stay was ever issued in the case. The Court remanded to this Court for
<line: 9> proceedings consistent with its ruling. The Plaintiffs have recently added two new Plaintiffs who
<line: 10> assert that they left the Company in 2016 and 2017.
<line: 11> Plaintiffs Motion for Conditional
<line: 12> Certification at Exhibits 5 and 6. Doc 26. For the first time on February 26, 2018, Plaintiffs
<line: 13> filed their motion for equitable tolling of the statute of limitations.. For the reasons discussed
<line: 14> below, equitable tolling is not appropriate in this case; and Plaintiffs’ motion should be denied.

[TITLE]
<line: 16> Legal Standard

[TEXT]
<line: 18> The equitable tolling “doctrine has been applied in two generally distinct kinds of
<line: 19> situations. In the first, the plaintiffs were prevented from asserting their claims by some kind of
<line: 20> wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant. In the second, extraordinary circumstances
<line: 21> beyond plaintiffs' control made it impossible to file the claims on time.” Harris v. Hutchinson,
<line: 22> 209 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). “[A]ny invocation of equity to relieve the
<line: 23> strict application of a statute of limitations must be guarded and infrequent, lest circumstances of
<line: 24> individualized hardship supplant the rules of clearly drafted statutes.”
<line: 25> Id.
<line: 26> Equitable tolling
<line: 27> “must be reserved for those rare instances where-due to circumstances external to the party's own
<line: 28> conduct-it would be unconscionable to enforce the limitation period against the party and gross
<line: 29> injustice would result.” Id.

[TITLE]
<line: 9> Argument

[TITLE]
<line: 11> Equitable Tolling is A Rare Remedy Not Warranted In This Case.

[TEXT]
<line: 13> In their motion, Plaintiffs assert no misconduct by Schmidt.
<line: 14> They claim instead that
<line: 15> delay due to Schmidt’s motion to dismiss is an extraordinary circumstance beyond the control of
<line: 16> potential class members and justifies tolling from the date it was filed on July 27, 2016.
<line: 17> Plaintiff’s motion is unfounded because (1) Plaintiffs cannot request tolling for unspecified
<line: 18> potential plaintiffs who have not opted in, (2) the filing of Schmidt’s motion to dismiss, which
<line: 19> was partially affirmed, was a routine act of litigation and not an extraordinary circumstance; and
<line: 20> (3) potential putative class member could have preserved their claims and thus require no
<line: 21> extraordinary equitable intervention (4) seeking equitable tolling in these circumstances would
<line: 22> defeat class certification and the need for such class-based relief.

[TEXT]
<line: 24> 1. Plaintiffs’ Cannot Request Tolling For Unspecified Potential Plaintiffs.

[TEXT]
<line: 26> In their motion Plaintiffs seek to toll the statute of limitation for an unspecified group of
<line: 27> potential plaintiffs who have not opted in, and presumably on behalf of the two they have just
<line: 28> added. See generally Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Support of their Motion for Equitable Tolling
<line: 29> of the Statute of Limitation (“Pls. Mem. Equitable Tolling”). Plaintiffs are not permitted to make
<line: 30> such a request because they do not represent these unspecified potential plaintiffs. See Atkinson
<line: 31> v. TeleTech Holdings, Inc., No. 3:14-CV-253, 2015 WL 853234, at *8 (S.D. Ohio Feb. 26, 2015)

<line: 6> Cameron-Grant v. Maxim Healthcare Servs., Inc., 347 F.3d 1240, 1249 (11th Cir. 2003)(the
<line: 7> named plaintiffs in a section 216(b) action have “no right to represent” potential opt-in parties.);
<line: 8> Leigh v. Bottling Grp., LLC, No. CIV.A. DKC 10-0218, 2012 WL 460468, at *6 (D. Md. Feb.
<line: 9> 10, 2012) (“the collective action provision of the FLSA“is a fundamentally different creature
<line: 10> than the Rule 23 class action. Even if the [FLSA] plaintiff can demonstrate that there are other
<line: 11> plaintiffs ‘similarly situated’ to him...he has no right to represent them.”).

[TEXT]
<line: 13> 2. Defendant’s Filing of its Motion to Dismiss Does Not Justify Tolling of the FLSA Statute
<line: 14> of Limitations.

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Equitable tolling must also be denied because the alleged justification for it -- delay
<line: 17> resulting from Schmidt’s motion to dismiss and Plaintiffs’ only partially successful appeal -- is
<line: 18> not an “extraordinary circumstance” beyond the putative members’ control. See Pls. Mem.
<line: 19> Equitable Tolling at 6-7.
<line: 20> Courts in this circuit and elsewhere routinely reject mere litigation
<line: 21> delay as a basis for tolling. See LaFleur v. Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., No. 2:12-CV-00363, 2012
<line: 22> WL 4739534, at *5 (E.D. Va. Oct. 2, 2012) (the Court finding that Plaintiffs had not provided
<line: 23> any extraordinary circumstance that justifies equitable tolling in this case when Plaintiffs
<line: 24> attempted to rely upon litigation-related delays.); See MacGregor v. Farmers Ins. Exch., No.
<line: 25> 2:10-CV-03088, 2011 WL 2731227, at *2 (D.S.C. July 13, 2011) (the Court rejecting Plaintiffs
<line: 26> argument that defendant's motion to dismiss constituted “extraordinary circumstances” in which
<line: 27> tolling would be appropriate.); Sandoz v. Cingular Wireless, L.L.C., 700 F. App'x 317, 321 (5th
<line: 28> Cir. 2017)(the Court finding unavailing Plaintiff’s assertion that defendant's litigation strategy
<line: 29> was an extraordinary circumstance that prevented timely filing.); Robinson v. RWLS, LLC, No.
<line: 30> SA-16-CA-00201-OLG, 2017 WL 1535072, at *2 (W.D. Tex. Mar. 14, 2017) (“The filing of

[TEXT]
<line: 4> motions to dismiss and inevitable court delays are part of routine litigation which, by definition,
<line: 5> do not equate with extraordinary circumstances.'); Vaughn v. Oak St. Mortg., LLC, No.
<line: 6> 505CV311OC10GRJ, 2006 WL 890071, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 3, 2006)(*Standing alone,
<line: 7> ordinary delays in the judicial system are routine and not considered extraordinary.").

[TEXT]
<line: 9> Moreover, even if litigation delay were ever a justification for tolling, Schmidt's motion
<line: 10> to dismiss was in part prompted by inclusion of state claims which were found by both the trial
<line: 11> court, and the Fourth Circuit, to have lacked merit, and were properly rejected. Delay arising at
<line: 12> least in part from Plaintiffs having included meritless claims on behalf of themselves and class
<line: 13> members, and requiring time necessary to address and dispose of them, clearly does not qualify
<line: 14> as an extraordinary circumstance, nor a situation creating any inequity in relation to Plaintiffs
<line: 15> and the putative class member.

[TEXT]
<line: 17> The authorities Plaintiffs cite fail to support their motion. In Rouse v. Lee, 339 F.3d 238,
<line: 18> (4th Cir. 2003) (en banc), the Fourth Circuit noted the limitation period in the Antiterrorism and
<line: 19> Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 theoretically could be subject to equitable tolling in
<line: 20> extraordinary situations, but had no difficulty denying its application in far more urgent and
<line: 21> compelling circumstances than here, to a death-row inmate claiming delay from incompetent
<line: 22> counsel and medical problems. The Court also stressed that "any resort to equity must be
<line: 23> reserved for those rare instances where-due to circumstances external to the party's own conduct
<line: 24> - it would be unconscionable to enforce the limitation period against the party and gross injustice
<line: 25> would result. Id. at 247. Mere delay from adjudication of a garden-variety Rule 12(b)(6), the
<line: 26> pursuit of which was partially vindicated on appeal, hardly rises that level.

[TEXT]
<line: 28> Plaintiffs' reliance on Stransky v. HealthONE of Denver, Inc., 868 F. Supp. 2d 1178 (D.
<line: 29> Colo. 2012) is equally misplaced. That decision cited to one federal case from District of Kansas

[TEXT]
<line: 4> in which the court inferred that the “unique circumstances of FLSA collective action can justify
<line: 5> tolling.” Stransky, 868 F. Supp. 2d at 1181.
<line: 6> However, Stransky is not binding and is refuted by
<line: 7> courts in this circuit rejecting its assumption that “the FLSA’s statute of limitations itself is an
<line: 8> extraordinary circumstance.” LaFleur, 2012 WL 4739534 at *6; see also MacGegor 2011 WL
<line: 9> 2731227 at *1 (D.S.C. July 13, 2011 (“The fact that a statute creates procedural requirements
<line: 10> that limit some potential claimants’ participation in a suit, standing alone, is insufficient to toll
<line: 11> the statute of limitations.”

[TITLE]
<line: 13> 3. Putative Class Members Could Have Preserved Their Claims.

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Plaintiffs’ motion is further unfounded because neither the putative class members nor
<line: 16> two new opt-ins have been impeded in preserving their claims.
<line: 17> Plaintiffs contend that the
<line: 18> putative class members’ claims would have been preserved but for Schmidt’s motion for
<line: 19> dismissal and the time associated with the appeals process. See Pls. Mem. Equitable Tolling at
<line: 20> 7. Plaintiffs also claim that these circumstances were not due to any inaction on part of the
<line: 21> putative class. Id.
<line: 22> As discussed above, however, the delay was due to a motion to dismiss that
<line: 23> in part successfully eliminated meritless claims filed on the class members’ behalf. Delay from
<line: 24> excision of defective counts can hardly be deemed an “extraordinary circumstance”, much less
<line: 25> one requiring equitable intervention against Schmidt’s, rather than the Plaintiff’s and class
<line: 26> members’ interest.

[TEXT]
<line: 28> Plaintiffs’ argument is also based on the erroneous premise that joining this case was the
<line: 29> only way to preserve putative class members’ claims and was foreclosed during the appeal. The
<line: 30> proper focus of equitable tolling, however, is not whether joinder in a particular case was
<line: 31> possible, but whether a timely claim was prevented in any form. See Sandoz v. Cingular
<line: 32> Wireless, L.L.C., 700 F. App'x 317, 321 (5th Cir. 2017)(“Equitable tolling, however, focuses on

<line: 4> whether an external obstacle “prevented timely filing,” not on whether an external obstacle
<line: 5> prevented timely filing in a specific suit.”)(emphasis in original).

[TEXT]
<line: 7> Joining this case was not the only way the putative class members could have preserved
<line: 8> their claims. These putative class members could have filed their own lawsuit for the express
<line: 9> purpose of preserving their causes of action. See Faust v. Comcast Cable Commc'ns Mgmt.,
<line: 10> LLC, No. CIV.A. WMN-10-2336, 2013 WL 1395933, at *4 (D. Md. Apr. 3, 2013) (declining to
<line: 11> toll the statute of limitations for a putative plaintiff and noting that the putative plaintiff was not
<line: 12> prevented from filing his own lawsuit.).
<line: 13> They were on inquiry notice of their claims, knowing
<line: 14> the hours they worked and the nature of the job and were no less able than the Plaintiffs
<line: 15> themselves to have sought counsel and brought suit or to have done so pro se.
<line: 16> No showing has
<line: 17> been made of reasonable diligence on their part.

[TEXT]
<line: 19> Additionally, Plaintiffs claim that absent the requested tolling many potential members’
<line: 20> claims have already been lost. Pls. Mem. Equitable Tolling at 6. This argument is unavailing as
<line: 21> the purpose of the equitable tolling doctrine is not to revive expired claims that could have been
<line: 22> brought. Courts have declined to revive and extend limitations period in cases where putative
<line: 23> plaintiffs neglected to pursue their FLSA claims until after the statute of limitations on their
<line: 24> claims had expired. See In re Tyson Foods, Inc., No. 4:07-MD-1854 (CDL), 2008 WL 4613654,
<line: 25> at *3 (M.D. Ga. Oct. 15, 2008)( the Court denying the motion for equitable tolling where each
<line: 26> potential claimant had the opportunity to file an individual action to vindicate his or her legal
<line: 27> rights under FLSA.); Switzer v. Wachovia Corp., No. CIV.A. H-11-1604, 2012 WL 1231743, at
<line: 28> *1 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 12, 2012)(the Court denying equitable tolling after Plaintiffs argued for
<line: 29> tolling of an expired statute of limitations.).

<line: 4> Indeed, this Court has refused to toll the statute of limitations in a case like this where a
<line: 5> period of time has passed after filing of a motion to dismiss and an appeal, when a plaintiffs have

<line: 7> or a stay. Harbourt v. PPE Casino Resorts of Maryland, 2017 WL 281992, (D.Md. Jan. 23,
<line: 8> 2017). In that case Judge Blake noted that the plaintiffs could have tried to seek a stay or
<line: 9> additional plaintiffs during the procedural delay and failed to do so. This lack of due diligence
<line: 10> was fatal to the tolling motion. Id. at *3.. The Court also noted that such procedural delays are

[TEXT]
<line: 13> In sum, given the ready ability of the putative class members to pursue and preserve their
<line: 14> own claims, not extending the limitations period, by use of the rarely applicable intervention of
<line: 15> tolling, would neither be “unconscionable” or create any “gross injustice,” but simply impose the
<line: 16> normal obligation upon would-be litigants not personally to sleep on their potential rights. Rouse,

<line: 20> Equitable Tolling Would Require Individualized Adjudications

[TEXT]
<line: 22> Further undermining Plaintiffs’ request for equitable tolling is that fact that it is made on
<line: 23> behalf of a putative class for which conditional certification is being simultaneously sought.
<line: 24> Whether putative class members were entitled to equitable tolling would depend, at a minimum,
<line: 25> on their personal circumstances and individual situations.
<line: 26> For example, those putative class
<line: 27> members who were contacted by the Plaintiffs or their counsel in any effort initially to enlarge
<line: 28> the number of original plaintiffs, or were contacted by them in the meantime for support, or for
<line: 29> seeking evidence, would fully have been on express notice of their potential rights and could
<line: 30> have brought suit, assuming that garden-variety notice were insufficient.

<line: 4> likewise be chargeable with having sat on their rights. The need for individualized evidence and
<line: 5> adjudication of these issues undermines conditional certification of the class, with in turn
<line: 6> eliminates the need for equitable tolling of class members' claims because the underlying class
<line: 7> claims would be unmanageable. As noted by this Court in Syrja v. Westat, Inc., 756 F. Supp. 2d
<line: 8> 682, 688 n. 9 (D. Md. 2010):

[TEXT]
<line: 10> Syrja's request that the Court equitably toll the statute of limitations on the FLSA claims
<line: 11> of as yet unidentified putative class members, so as to relieve them of the consequences
<line: 12> of "delays' resulting from prior stages of this litigation suggests yet another.
<line: 13> individualized layer of inquiry that would make certification of the class unwieldy. As a
<line: 14> rule, unknown prospective plaintiffs in a proposed class action are not entitled to
<line: 15> equitable tolling absent a showing of extraordinary or unusual circumstances. Here, the
<line: 16> Court would have to inquire into whether extraordinary or unusual circumstances exists
<line: 17> as to each of an indeterminate number of proposed class members.

[TEXT]
<line: 19> (Emphasis added).

[TEXT]
<line: 21> In support of their proposed order relating to conditional certification, Plaintiffs have
<line: 22> included certain allegedly "curative" measures supposedly prompted by statements of a retired
<line: 23> Schmidt Vice President who allegedly warned a group of approximately twelve Schmidt District.
<line: 24> Sales Managers against joining the suit.  See Motion at 13 -14 and Declaration of Michael.
<line: 25> Mcewen. Understandably, Plaintiffs have not cited any such conduct as a basis for equitable
<line: 26> tolling because it would clearly raise individualized issues concerning who claims to have heard
<line: 27> the statements and what their reactions supposedly were. In addition, alleged class members
<line: 28> who had left Schmidt before this statement was allegedly made, would not be entitled to
<line: 29> equitable tolling.' In any event, the allegations about the statements are disputed and cannot be.
<line: 30> resolved on motion. See Exhibits 8, 1 and 5 to Schmidt's Opposition to Plaintiffs' Class

<line: 32> I In addition, the new Plaintiffs who were recently added to this lawsuit assert in their.
<line: 33> Declarations Exhibits 5 and 6 to the Motion for Conditional Certification that they left the
<line: 34> Company long before this tolling motion was filed, and should not be rewarded for sitting on
<line: 35> their rights well after any alleged fear for their jobs would have had any impact.

[TITLE]
<line: 9> Conclusion

[TEXT]
<line: 11> Equitable tolling should be denied because Plaintiffs do not have the authority to request
<line: 12> equitable tolling on behalf of unspecified potential plaintiffs. Additionally, Plaintiffs have put
<line: 13> forth no extraordinary circumstances that warrant equitable tolling. Putative class members could
<line: 14> have but failed to preserve their claims. Lastly, seeking tolling in conjunction with a motion for
<line: 15> conditional certification undermines class treatment. Defendant therefore respectfully requests
<line: 16> that equitable tolling be denied as such a rare remedy is not appropriate in this case.
