<line: 24> COMES NOW the Defendant and Counter-Plaintiff, the School Board of the City of 
<line: 25> Virginia Beach, Virginia d/b/a Virginia Beach City Public Schools (the “School Division” or 
<line: 26> “VBCPS”), by counsel, for its Response to Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant’s Motion for Attorney’s 
<line: 27> Fees Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and states: 

[TITLE]
<line: 29> INTRODUCTION 

[TEXT]
<line: 31> “The IDEA provides that an award of attorneys’ fees may be granted to a parent making 
<line: 32> an IDEA if that parent is the ‘prevailing party’ in the litigation.”  J.P. v. Cnty. Sch. Bd., 641 F. 
<line: 33> Supp. 2d 499, 509 (E.D. Va. 2009) (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(1)).  Here, the Court found 
<line: 34> that M.N. was the prevailing party and granted attorney’s fees.  Opinion & Order at 27-28, Feb. 5, 
<line: 35> 2018, Doc. 69. 

[TEXT]
<line: 37> The School Division agrees that the hourly rate of $250 charged by counsel is reasonable. 
<line: 38> The School Division respectfully requests, however, a modest reduction of the hours claimed by 
<line: 39> Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant if Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant seeks fees for non-legal or clerical 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> tasks, and for hours expended in connection with Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant’s Motion for Order 
<line: 3> to Show Cause. 

[TITLE]
<line: 5> BURDEN OF PROOF AND LEGAL STANDARD 

[TITLE]
<line: 7> I. 
<line: 8> Burden of Proof. 

[TEXT]
<line: 10> “‘[T]he fee applicant bears the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence the 
<line: 11> amount of a reasonable fee in the circumstances.’” Cnty. Sch. Bd. v. A.L., No. 4:03CV174, 2007 
<line: 12> U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16395, at *15 (E.D. Va. Mar. 6, 2007) (quoting Rucker v. Sheehy Alexandria, 
<line: 13> Inc., 255 F. Supp. 2d 562, 564 (E.D. Va. 2003)).  Regarding the total work and hours claimed, 
<line: 14> “‘fee claimants must submit documentation that reflects reliable contemporaneous recordation of 
<line: 15> time spent on legal tasks that are described with reasonable particularity, sufficient to permit the 
<line: 16> court to weigh the hours claimed and exclude hours that were not reasonably expended.’”  Id. 
<line: 17> (quoting Rucker, 255 F. Supp. 2d at 564)). 

[TEXT]
<line: 19> “Where the documentation of hours is inadequate, the district court may reduce the award 
<line: 20> accordingly.”  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983).  “‘Inadequate documentation 
<line: 21> includes the practice of grouping, or ‘lumping,’ several tasks together under a single entry, without 
<line: 22> specifying the amount of time spent on each particular task.’”  A.L., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16395, 
<line: 23> at *16 (quoting Rucker, 255 F. Supp. 2d at 564 n.3). 

[TEXT]
<line: 25> “‘[D]etermination of the hourly rate will generally be the critical inquiry in setting the 
<line: 26> ‘reasonable fee,’ and the burden rests with the fee applicant to establish the reasonableness of a 
<line: 27> requested rate.’” Id. (quoting Plyler v. Evatt, 902 F.2d 273, 277 (4th Cir. 1990)). “‘In addition to 
<line: 28> the attorney’s own affidavits, the fee applicant must produce satisfactory ‘specific evidence of the 
<line: 29> prevailing market rates in the relevant community for the type of work for which [s]he seeks an 
<line: 30> award.’” Id. (quoting Plyler, 902 F.2d at 277). 

[ABANDON]
<line: 32> 2 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> “The overall fee award may be reduced due to inadequate documentation by either 
<line: 3> ‘identifying and disallowing specific hours that are not adequately documented, or by reducing the 
<line: 4> overall fee award by a fixed percentage or amount based on the trial court’s familiarity with the 
<line: 5> case, its complexity and the counsel involved.’” Id. at *16-17 (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433). 

[TITLE]
<line: 7> II. 
<line: 8> Calculating the Fee. 

[TEXT]
<line: 10> “The Court has ‘broad discretion’ in determining the appropriate fee award.”  Id. at *6 
<line: 11> (quoting Carroll v. Abramson, 53 F.3d 626, 628 (4th Cir. 1995)).  “The amount of attorneys’ fees 
<line: 12> awarded to prevailing IDEA plaintiffs ‘shall be based on rates prevailing in the community in 
<line: 13> which the action or proceeding arose for the kind and quality of services furnished.’”  J.P. v. Cnty. 
<line: 14> Sch. Bd., 641 F. Supp. 2d 499, 512 (E.D. Va. 2009) (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(C)).  “[T]he 
<line: 15> ‘starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably 
<line: 16> expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.’”  Id. (quoting Hensley v. 
<line: 17> Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983)).  “The result of that calculation is known as the lodestar 
<line: 18> figure. If properly computed, ‘the lodestar figure will normally reflect a reasonable fee.’”  Id. 
<line: 19> (quoting A.D. ex rel. S.D. v. Bd. of Pub. Ed. of the City of Asheville, 99 F. Supp. 2d 683, 687 
<line: 20> (W.D.N.C. 1999)). 

[TEXT]
<line: 22> “Those two variables, as well as the lodestar figure itself, are assessed in light of the twelve 
<line: 23> factors set forth in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-719 (5th Cir. 
<line: 24> 1974).”  Id. (citing E.E.O.C. v. Service News Co., 898 F.2d 958, 965 (4th Cir. 1990)).  Those 
<line: 25> factors are: 

[TEXT]
<line: 27> (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions; (3) 
<line: 28> the level of skill required to perform the legal service properly; (4) the preclusion 
<line: 29> of employment by the attorney due to the acceptance of the case; (5) the customary 
<line: 30> fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) the time limitations imposed by 
<line: 31> the client or the circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; 
<line: 32> (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the “undesirability” 

[ABANDON]
<line: 34> 3 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the 
<line: 3> client; and (12) awards in similar cases. 

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Id. (citing Johnson, 488 F.2d at 717-19). 

[TITLE]
<line: 7> DISCUSSION 

[TEXT]
<line: 9> As a preliminary matter, the School Division does not dispute that the hourly rate of $250 
<line: 10> charged by counsel is reasonable.  The School Division notes, however, that counsel’s final 
<line: 11> invoice, dated March 3, 2018, charges an increased hourly rate of $275.  Given that 
<line: 12> Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant has produced no evidence to support this higher rate, the School 
<line: 13> Division requests that the hourly rate of $250 apply uniformly to all legal work.   

[TEXT]
<line: 15> While Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant addressed none of the Johnson factors, the School 
<line: 16> Division’s remaining objections to Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant’s fee request are nevertheless few.  
<line: 17> The School Division contends that this modest reduction of the hours claimed is appropriate:  (1) 
<line: 18> 21.90 hours for non-legal or clerical tasks; and (2) 6.20 hours that were not reasonably expended 
<line: 19> in connection with Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant’s Motion for Order to Show Cause, which could 
<line: 20> have been avoided by simply conferring with opposing counsel. 

[TITLE]
<line: 22> I. 
<line: 23> Clerical tasks. 

[TEXT]
<line: 25> “In determining the lodestar figure, it is important to note that this amount only applies to 
<line: 26> legal work.  A lesser rate may attend clerical and administrative functions.”  Cnty. Sch. Bd. v. A.L., 
<line: 27> No. 4:03CV174, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16395, at *19 n.5 (E.D. Va. Mar. 6, 2007).  As this Court 
<line: 28> has explained: 

[TEXT]
<line: 30> It is appropriate to distinguish between legal work, in the strict sense, and 
<line: 31> investigation, clerical work, compilation of facts and statistics and other work 
<line: 32> which can often be accomplished by non-lawyers but which a lawyer may do 
<line: 33> because [s]he has no other help available.  Such non-legal work may command a 
<line: 34> lesser rate.  Its dollar value is not enhanced just because a lawyer does it. 

[TEXT]
<line: 36> Id. (quoting Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717 (5th Cir. 1974)). 

[ABANDON]
<line: 38> 4 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Importantly, where the fee claimant has "produced no evidence of the prevailing market.
<line: 3> rate for clerical or secretarial work typical to that which was performed[,] . . . the Court cannot
<line: 4> apportion time spent on non-legal work at any rate, because it has no evidence from which to.
<line: 5> conclude a reasonable market rate for non-legal work." Id. at *34-35. The Court should similarly.
<line: 6> deduct those entries that impermissibly lump both legal and non-legal work. Id. at *34 ('The
<line: 7> Court's review of [the attorney's] Statement of Work Performed indicates several entries involving
<line: 8> impermissible lumping of tasks, including combining organizing the file and other tasks. While it.
<line: 9> is possible to speculate whether these tasks were non-legal and/or what percentage was non-legal,
<line: 10> no documentary clarification has been provided by [the attorney]")..

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Here, these time entries seek fees for 21.90 hours of non-legal work, or impermissibly lump
<line: 13> legal and non-legal work. As Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant has produced no evidence of the
<line: 14> prevailing market rate for such non-legal work, these hours should be deducted in their entirety..

<line: 2> of Notice of Costs, Doc. 56 ("Show Cause Motion'). It is undisputed that counsel for
<line: 3> Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant failed to confer with counsel for the School Division before filing the
<line: 4> motion. As the School Division explained in its response to the Show Cause Motion

[TEXT]
<line: 6> [W]hile Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant briefly notes that *[t]he School Board has ..
<line: 7> . not provided an explanation for their failure to adhere to the order of this Court,'
<line: 8> counsel for Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant made no attempt to contact or [confer]
<line: 9> with VBCPS before filing the Show Cause Motion with the Court. Indeed, on
<line: 10> October 16, 2017, the day before filing the Show Cause Motion, counsel for
<line: 11> Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant emailed VBCPS counsel the October 2017 invoice and
<line: 12> spreadsheets for reimbursement, but made no mention of any delay in processing
<line: 13> the September 2017 reimbursement or any intent to move for Show Cause. VBCPS
<line: 14> agrees with Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant that she "should . . . not be required to
<line: 15> allocate funds to the legal pursuit of money owed to them from the school district."'
<line: 16> Such "legal pursuit," however, was unnecessary. Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant
<line: 17> could have achieved the same result with a simple phone call or email..

[TEXT]
<line: 22> VBCPs' failure to make timely payment was not intentional, and as the Court found, once
<line: 23> VBCPS counsel was made aware, VBCPS "remedied its negligence . . . , paid the October fees
<line: 24> early, and paid the ESY fees despite a continuing disagreement that ESY was necessary." Order
<line: 25> at 2, Nov. 15, 2017, Doc. 67. In short, the 6.20 hours claimed by counsel for Plaintiff/Counter-
<line: 26> Defendant for pursuing this motion, as detailed in the table below, were not reasonably expended.
<line: 27> The same result could have been achieved by simply conferring with VBCPS counsel.

<line: 2> CONCLUSION 

[TEXT]
<line: 4> For the foregoing reasons, the School Division, by counsel, respectfully requests this Court 
<line: 5> find that $250 is a reasonable hourly rate, that the hours claimed by counsel for Plaintiff/Counter-
<line: 6> Defendant should be reduced by 28.10 hours, and provide such further relief as this Court deems 
<line: 7> appropriate.  Additionally, as the School Division is a public body, various levels of approval are 
<line: 8> required before issuing any significant payment.  As such, the School Division respectfully 
<line: 9> requests that any payment of fees be due within thirty (30) days of the Court’s order on 
<line: 10> Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant’s Motion for Fees.
