[TITLE]
<line: 27> ORDER

[TEXT]
<line: 29> This matter comes before the Court after Plaintiffs' failure to properly serve their
<line: 30> Complaint and their failure to comply with or in any way respond to the Court's September 25.
<line: 31> 2018 Order. (Doc. 4.) The Court DISMISSES this action WITHOUT PREJUDICE for
<line: 32> Plaintiffs' failure to prosecute, failure to follow this Court's Orders, and failure to timely serve the
<line: 33> Complaint. The Court DIRECTS the Clerk of Court to CLOSE this case. Though this dismissal
<line: 34> is without prejudice, should Plaintiffs' counsel seek to refile this case,' he must file

[ABANDON]
<line: 36>  Plaintiffs could potentially not be able to refile this case because of the expiration of the statute of
<line: 37> limitations. Without expressing any opinion on that issue, the Court has considered that possibility when
<line: 38> issuing this dismissal. Even if the statute of limitations bars Plaintiffs from refiling this case, dismissal is
<line: 39> warranted due to Plaintiffs' failure to timely serve the Complaint and failure to respond in any manner
<line: 40> whatsoever to the Court's Order. Through these failures, Plaintiffs have demonstrated a clear record of

[TEXT]
<line: 2> contemporaneously with the complaint an explanation of cause for his failure to serve this action
<line: 3> in a timely manner and his failure to respond to the Court's September 25, 2018 Order.

[TITLE]
<line: 5> BACKGROUND

[TEXT]
<line: 7> The background of this case is laid out in detail in the Court's September 25, 2018 Order.
<line: 8> (Id.) Put succinctly, after filing this action approximately twenty-one months ago, Plaintiffs failed.
<line: 9> to properly serve any of the Defendants. In its Court's September 25, 2018 Order, the Court.
<line: 10> ordered Plaintiffs to show cause for their failure to timely serve Defendants. (Id. at p. 2.) Plaintiffs
<line: 11> have made no response to that Order or taken any other action in this case since that Order.

[TITLE]
<line: 13> DISCUSSION

[TEXT]
<line: 15> A district court may dismiss a plaintiff's claims sua sponte pursuant to either Federal Rule
<line: 16> of Civil Procedure 41(b) ("Rule 41(b)") or the court's inherent authority to manage its docket.
<line: 17> Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626 (1962);2 Coleman v. St. Lucie Cty. Jail, 433 F. App'x 716,
<line: 18> 718 (11th Cir. 2011) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b) and Betty K Agencies, Ltd. v. M/V MONADA,
<line: 19> 432 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir. 2005)). In particular, Rule 41(b) allows for the involuntary
<line: 20> dismissal of a plaintiff's claims where he has failed to prosecute those claims, comply with the
<line: 21> Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or local rules, or follow a court order. Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b); see.
<line: 22> also Coleman, 433 F. App'x at 718; Sanders v. Barrett, No. 05-12660, 2005 WL 2640979, at *1
<line: 23> (11th Cir. Oct. 17, 2005) (citing Kilgo v. Ricks, 983 F.2d 189, 192 (11th Cir. 1993)); cf. Local R.
<line: 24> 41.1(b) ([T]he assigned Judge may, after notice to counsel of record, sua sponte . . . dismiss any.
<line: 25> action for want of prosecution, with or without prejudice[,] . . . [based on] willful disobedience or

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> delay and willful contempt and, particularly given the lack of response to the Court's prior Order, any
<line: 28> sanction lesser than dismissal would not suffice..

[ABANDON]
<line: 30> 2 In Wabash, the Court held that a trial court may dismiss an action for failure to prosecute "even without
<line: 31> affording notice of its intention to do so." 370 U.S. at 633. Nonetheless, the Court provided Plaintiffs with
<line: 32> notice that their failure to show cause would result in dismissal of their Complaint. (Doc. 4, p. 2.)

[ABANDON]
<line: 34> 2

[TEXT]
<line: 2> neglect of any order of the Court." (emphasis omitted)). Additionally, a district court's "power to
<line: 3> dismiss is an inherent aspect of its authority to enforce its orders and ensure prompt disposition of.
<line: 4> lawsuits.' Brown v. Tallahassee Police Dep't, 205 F. App'x 802, 802 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting.
<line: 5> Jones v. Graham, 709 F.2d 1457, 1458 (11th Cir. 1983)).

[TEXT]
<line: 7> It is true that dismissal with prejudice for failure to prosecute is a "sanction . . . to be utilized
<line: 8> only in extreme situations" and requires that a court "(1) conclud[e] a clear record of delay or
<line: 9> willful contempt exists; and (2) mak[e] an implicit or explicit finding that lesser sanctions would
<line: 10> not suffice." Thomas v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Educ., 170 F. App'x 623, 625-26 (11th Cir.
<line: 11> 2006) (quoting Morewitz v. West of Eng. Ship Owners Mut. Prot. & Indem. Ass'n (Lux.), 62 F.3d
<line: 12> 1356, 1366 (11th Cir. 1995)); see also Taylor v. Spaziano, 251 F. App'x 616, 619 (11th Cir. 2007)
<line: 13> (citing Morewitz, 62 F.3d at 1366). By contrast, dismissal without prejudice for failure to
<line: 14> prosecute is not an adjudication on the merits, and, therefore, courts are afforded greater discretion
<line: 15> in dismissing claims in this manner. Taylor, 251 F. App'x at 619; see also Coleman, 433 F. App'x
<line: 16> at 719; Brown, 205 F. App'x at 802-03.

[TEXT]
<line: 18> While the Court exercises its discretion to dismiss cases with caution, dismissal of this.
<line: 19> action without prejudice is warranted. See Coleman, 433 F. App'x at 719 (upholding dismissal.
<line: 20> without prejudice for failure to prosecute Section 1983 complaint, where plaintiff did not respond
<line: 21> to court order to supply defendant's current address for purpose of service); Taylor, 251 F. App'x
<line: 22> at 620-21 (upholding dismissal without prejudice for failure to prosecute, because plaintiffs
<line: 23> insisted on going forward with deficient amended complaint rather than complying, or seeking an
<line: 24> extension of time to comply, with court's order to file second amended complaint); Brown, 205 F.
<line: 25> App'x at 802-03 (upholding dismissal without prejudice for failure to prosecute Section 1983
<line: 26> claims, where plaintiff failed to follow court order to file amended complaint and court had
<line: 27> informed plaintiff that noncompliance could lead to dismissal).

[TEXT]
<line: 2> Moreover, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 4(m) mandates that the Court dismiss a 
<line: 3> complaint when a plaintiff fails to effect service within 90 days of the filing of the complaint.  A 
<line: 4> plaintiff may request an extension of time for service of process upon the showing of good cause.  
<line: 5> Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m).  A plaintiff has the burden of demonstrating the existence of “good cause” 
<line: 6> justifying service outside of the deadline.  Sanders v. Fluor Daniel, Inc., 151 F.R.D. 138, 139 (M.D. 
<line: 7> Fla. 1993).  “To demonstrate good cause, the plaintiff must offer evidence that she (1) has 
<line: 8> proceeded in good faith; (2) has a reasonable basis for noncompliance and (3) the basis for the 
<line: 9> delay was more than simple inadvertence or mistake.”  Durgin v. Mon, 659 F. Supp. 2d 1240, 1258 
<line: 10> (S.D. Fla. 2009), aff’d, 415 F. App’x 161 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (citing Sanders, 151 F.R.D 
<line: 11> at 139; Prisco v. Frank, 929 F.2d 603, 604 (11th Cir. 1991); Horenkamp v. Van Winkle & Co., 
<line: 12> 402 F.3d 1129, 1130–31 (11th Cir. 2005)). 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> This Court directed Plaintiffs to show cause for their failure to timely serve Defendants.  
<line: 15> Despite the Court’s specific instructions, Plaintiffs have failed to show cause, much less taken any 
<line: 16> effort to comply with their service obligations.  Accordingly, the Court DISMISSES without 
<line: 17> prejudice Plaintiffs’ Complaint for failure to prosecute, failure to follow this Court’s Orders, and 
<line: 18> failure to timely serve their Complaint.

[TITLE]
<line: 2> CONCLUSION

[TEXT]
<line: 4> For the foregoing reasons, the Court DISMIsSES without prejudice Plaintiff's
<line: 5> Complaint and DIRECTS the Clerk of Court to CLOSE this case. Though this dismissal is
<line: 6> without prejudice, should Plaintiffs' counsel seek to refile this case, he must file
<line: 7> contemporaneously with the complaint an explanation of cause for his failure to serve this action
<line: 8> in a timely manner and his failure to respond to the Court's September 25, 2018 Order.
