[TITLE]
<line: 16> MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 18> Plaintiff Arlene Simpson worked as a registered nurse at defendant St. 
<line: 19> James Hospital until she was terminated, ostensibly for her two-year pattern of 
<line: 20> rude and otherwise inappropriate behavior. In this action, however, plaintiff claims 
<line: 21> the real reason she was fired is that she was female, African American, over 40, or 
<line: 22> pregnant. Plaintiff’s four-count complaint alleges violations of Title VII of the Civil 
<line: 23> Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and the Americans 
<line: 24> with Disabilities Act. Defendant has moved for summary judgment on all counts. 
<line: 25> For the following reasons, defendant’s motion is granted.

[TEXT]
<line: 30> Summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that there is no 
<line: 31> genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a 
<line: 32> matter of law. Spurling v. C & M Fine Pack, Inc., 739 F.3d 1055, 1060 (7th Cir. 
<line: 33> 2014); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A genuine dispute as to any material fact exists if “the 
<line: 34> evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving

<line: 2> party.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). The party seeking 
<line: 3> summary judgment has the burden of establishing that there is no genuine dispute 
<line: 4> as to any material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). 

[TITLE]
<line: 6> II. 
<line: 7> Background 

[TEXT]
<line: 9> Plaintiff Arlene Simpson, an African-American woman, began working as a 
<line: 10> registered nurse at defendant St. James Hospital in 2008. Assigned to an orthopedic 
<line: 11> surgery floor called “3 South,” plaintiff’s duties included caring for patients, taking 
<line: 12> vital signs, reporting patients’ conditions to doctors, and helping with admission 
<line: 13> and discharge.  

[TEXT]
<line: 15> In late 2009, Maureen Kelly, a Caucasian woman, became the patient care 
<line: 16> manager on 3 South and thus plaintiff’s supervisor.1 Although plaintiff regularly 
<line: 17> received high performance review scores from the manager she had before Kelly, 
<line: 18> plaintiff’s scores dropped off substantially once Kelly took over. And for the first 
<line: 19> time, plaintiff began receiving formal reprimands for allegedly violating hospital 
<line: 20> rules. These citations were documented on forms called “Employee Corrective 
<line: 21> Action Reports,” in which Kelly would describe the underlying conduct, identify the 
<line: 22> rule plaintiff violated, indicate the punishment (if any), and call for plaintiff’s 
<line: 23> signature. Plaintiff denies that any of the reprimands—or her eventual 
<line: 24> termination—were justified. A summary of the reports follows below. 

[ABANDON]
<line: 26> 1 Plaintiff also reported to two “charge nurses,” Glen Rach (a Caucasian male) and Vanessa 
<line: 27> Mendez (a Caucasian female). 

[ABANDON]
<line: 29> 2 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> On October 14, 2010, plaintiff received an “oral reminder” after a doctor 
<line: 3> complained that plaintiff failed to follow his orders to discontinue a patient’s 
<line: 4> morphine pump and change the patient’s surgical dressing. 

[TEXT]
<line: 6> On January 14, 2011, plaintiff received a “written reminder” in which Kelly 
<line: 7> said plaintiff directed a patient care technician to help with two medical procedures 
<line: 8> which were beyond the technician’s scope of care. Plaintiff was also alleged to have 
<line: 9> noted the process and result of one of the procedures in the patient’s file, even 
<line: 10> though plaintiff did not actually participate in it.  

[TEXT]
<line: 12> On July 28, 2011, plaintiff received a “written reminder” from Kelly based on 
<line: 13> three “patient care concerns” all occurring that same month. On July 9, 2011, the 
<line: 14> Employee Corrective Action Report alleged, a patient’s daughter told the charge 
<line: 15> nurse that plaintiff’s perfume was so strong it made the patient sick. When plaintiff 
<line: 16> heard of this complaint, she confronted the patient and denied she was the one who 
<line: 17> had been wearing perfume in the patient’s presence. When the patient insisted it 
<line: 18> was her, plaintiff responded, “Great, now I will have to get the first patient”—i.e., 
<line: 19> the next patient to enter the hospital. Kelly testified that she was out of town when 
<line: 20> this incident occurred, but that she investigated and confirmed it when she 
<line: 21> returned. 

[TEXT]
<line: 23> On July 13, 2011, a patient’s fiancé complained that the room was dirty, a 
<line: 24> bedpan had been emptied into the toilet but not flushed, and a garbage can was 
<line: 25> attracting flies at the foot of the patient’s bed near her surgical wound. The fiancé 
<line: 26> also reported that the patient needed a sponge bath and that—when he suggested 

[ABANDON]
<line: 28> 3 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> as much to plaintiff—she rudely responded that she was doing her job so long as the 
<line: 3> patient was washed by the end of her shift. A patient care representative followed 
<line: 4> up on this complaint and then relayed the information to Kelly.  

[TEXT]
<line: 6> The last incident recorded in the July 28th “written reminder” occurred on 
<line: 7> July 20, 2011, when plaintiff allegedly failed to connect suction for a patient’s 
<line: 8> nasogastric tube as ordered by a doctor. The patient’s family also allegedly 
<line: 9> complained that plaintiff came off as though their requests bothered her. They 
<line: 10> asked for a different nurse to be assigned. 

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Finally, on September 26, 2011, one final Employee Corrective Action Report 
<line: 13> was prepared for plaintiff and it served as her notice of termination. When a patient 
<line: 14> complained to others about plaintiff failing to bring her ice, plaintiff confronted the 
<line: 15> patient, denied she ever asked plaintiff for ice, and remarked that plaintiff “did not 
<line: 16> need any bad marks against her.” Plaintiff then proceeded to remove the patient’s 
<line: 17> morphine pump, which Kelly construed as retaliation. Kelly investigated the 
<line: 18> complaint and—citing the events documented in the reports dated October 14, 2010, 
<line: 19> January 14, 2011, and July 28, 2011—terminated plaintiff.   

[TEXT]
<line: 21> After unsuccessfully appealing her termination, plaintiff filed the present 
<line: 22> action in which she alleges four types of employment discrimination. In Count I, 
<line: 23> plaintiff claims she was written up and terminated as a result of being over 40 
<line: 24> years old, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (29 U.S.C. 
<line: 25> § 621 et seq.). In Counts II and III, plaintiff claims she was written up and 
<line: 26> terminated because she is African American and female, in violation of Title VII of 

[ABANDON]
<line: 28> 4 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 et seq.). Finally, in Count IV, 
<line: 3> plaintiff claims Kelly wrote her up and terminated her due to plaintiff’s pregnancy,2 
<line: 4> in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.). 
<line: 5> Defendant has moved for summary judgment on all counts.    

[TITLE]
<line: 7> III. 
<line: 8> Analysis 

[TEXT]
<line: 10> Because plaintiff has no direct evidence of discrimination, she seeks to 
<line: 11> maintain her four claims under the burden-shifting analysis of McDonnell Douglas 
<line: 12> Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). Under this method, a plaintiff establishes a 
<line: 13> prima facie case of sex-, age-, race-, or disability-based discrimination if she 
<line: 14> demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: (1) she is a member of these 
<line: 15> protected classes; (2) at the time of termination, she was meeting her employer’s 
<line: 16> legitimate employment expectations; (3) in spite of meeting the legitimate 
<line: 17> employment expectations of her employer, she suffered an adverse employment 
<line: 18> action; and (4) she was treated less favorably than similarly situated employees who 
<line: 19> were not part of the protected classes. See Peele v. Country Mutual Insurance Co., 
<line: 20> 288 F.3d 319, 326 (7th Cir. 2002); Patton v. Indianapolis Public School Bd., 276 
<line: 21> F.3d 34, 338 (7th Cir. 2002); Bunn v. Khoury Enterprises, Inc., 753 F.3d 676, 685 
<line: 22> (7th Cir. 2014). Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, 
<line: 23> the employer, to avoid liability, must produce a legitimate, nondiscriminatory 

[ABANDON]
<line: 25> 2 Simpson believes she was about six months pregnant at the end of her employment, and 
<line: 26> thinks she told Kelly about the pregnancy when she was two and a half to four months 
<line: 27> pregnant. Kelly instructed plaintiff to obtain a doctor’s note so there would be something on 
<line: 28> file saying what her restrictions were. Plaintiff never ultimately requested any 
<line: 29> accommodations for her pregnancy because she remained physically able to perform her job 
<line: 30> until the time of her termination. 

[ABANDON]

[TEXT]
<line: 2> reason for the employee’s termination. Peele, 288 F.3d at 326. If the employer is able 
<line: 3> to do this, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to rebut the explanation by 
<line: 4> presenting evidence sufficient to enable a trier of fact to find that the employer’s 
<line: 5> proffered explanation is pretextual. Id. Pretext means a dishonest explanation; a lie 
<line: 6> rather than an oddity or an error. Id. A plaintiff does not reach the pretext stage, 
<line: 7> however, unless she first establishes a prima facie case of discrimination. Id. 

[TEXT]
<line: 9> A. 
<line: 10> Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of discrimination 
<line: 11> on Counts I and II, but failed to establish a prima facie case on 
<line: 12> Counts III and IV. 

[TEXT]
<line: 14> Plaintiff attempts to satisfy the first element of her prima facie case—that 
<line: 15> she met defendant’s legitimate expectations—with evidence that she was never 
<line: 16> disciplined, and received only favorable reviews, before Kelly became her 
<line: 17> supervisor. This evidence is not probative, however, because “the issue is not the 
<line: 18> employee’s past performance but whether the employee was performing well at the 
<line: 19> time of her termination.” Peele, 288 F.3d at 329 (quotation omitted). “Furthermore, 
<line: 20> prior job performance evaluations, standing alone, do not create a genuine issue of 
<line: 21> triable fact when there have been substantial alterations in the employee’s 
<line: 22> responsibilities and supervision in the intervening period.” Id. (quotation omitted).  

[TEXT]
<line: 24> Plaintiff offers no other evidence on the first element but argues instead that 
<line: 25> she can establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing defendant applied 
<line: 26> its expectations in a discriminatory manner. “When a plaintiff produces evidence 
<line: 27> sufficient to raise an inference that an employer applied its legitimate employment 
<line: 28> expectations in a disparate manner (i.e., applied expectations to similarly situated 

[ABANDON]
<line: 30> 6 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> [male, younger, non-African-American, or non-disabled] employees in a more 
<line: 3> favorable manner), the second and fourth prongs of McDonnell Douglas merge—
<line: 4> allowing the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case, stave off summary judgment 
<line: 5> for the time being, and proceed to the pretext inquiry.” Peele, 288 F.3d at 329. 

[TEXT]
<line: 7> Plaintiff identifies four nurses who allegedly violated the same rules as her 
<line: 8> but who were not disciplined or terminated as she was: Nancy Galderia, Erica 
<line: 9> Martin, Robyn Williams, and Vanessa Mendez. Plaintiff does not identify any 
<line: 10> comparators who are male or expressly non-disabled. She therefore has no support 
<line: 11> for the inference that defendant applied its rules against her more strictly due to 
<line: 12> her gender or pregnancy. As a result, there is no genuine issue of material fact on 
<line: 13> Counts III and IV, and defendant’s motion is granted as to those counts. 

[TEXT]
<line: 15> The evidence on Galderia and Martin suffices to support the inference that 
<line: 16> defendant applied its rules disparately. Galderia (a Caucasian woman) was also 
<line: 17> involved in the July 13, 2011 incident, in which a patient’s fiancé complained that 
<line: 18> both plaintiff and Galderia were rude. Although defendant correctly notes that 
<line: 19> plaintiff alone is alleged to have returned to confront the fiancé, Galderia was not 
<line: 20> punished at all for her rudeness, which on its own violated the hospital’s written 
<line: 21> policy prohibiting “[r]ude or discourteous behavior to co-workers, patients, 
<line: 22> physicians or anyone else at St. James Hospital and Health Centers.” At the same 
<line: 23> time, rudeness underlay the Employee Corrective Action Report plaintiff received in 
<line: 24> relation to the events of July 9, 2011, and was specifically noted with regard to the 

[ABANDON]
<line: 26> 7 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> incident on July 13, 2011. If defendant applied its rules evenly, it would have cited 
<line: 3> Galderia for the infraction. 

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Likewise, both plaintiff and Felicia Carter swore under oath that Erica 
<line: 6> Martin, who was Caucasian and under 40, once received complaints from “an entire 
<line: 7> team of patients” (i.e., five to six patients) on one day, yet Martin was not 
<line: 8> disciplined at all. Defendant attempts to counter this by saying it has no record of 
<line: 9> such an incident, but that is wholly consistent with the theory that Martin was 
<line: 10> subjected to more lenient rules. 

[TEXT]
<line: 12> Accordingly, plaintiff’s race and age claims proceed to the pretext inquiry.    

[TEXT]
<line: 14> B. 
<line: 15> Plaintiff has not presented evidence sufficient to enable a trier 
<line: 16> of fact to find that defendant’s proffered explanations are 
<line: 17> pretextual. 

[TEXT]
<line: 19> Since plaintiff has produced evidence sufficient to raise an inference that 
<line: 20> defendant applied its legitimate employment expectations in a disparate manner, 
<line: 21> plaintiff must now show that defendant’s proffered reasons for terminating her—the 
<line: 22> events cited in the September 26, 2011 Employee Corrective Action Report—were 
<line: 23> merely pretextual. Defendant bears the burden at summary judgment to 
<line: 24> demonstrate its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, but plaintiff must come 
<line: 25> forward with some evidence that would allow the trier of fact to conclude that 
<line: 26> defendant’s reasons were lies. See Novak v. Board of Trustees of Southern Illinois 
<line: 27> University, 777 F.3d 966, 974 (7th Cir. 2015); Bojda v. Black Dot Graphics, Inc., 12 
<line: 28> F.3d 1100 at *1 (7th Cir. 1994) (table).  

[TEXT]
<line: 30> The first basis for termination was the “Oral Reminder for Work Performance 
<line: 31> on October 16, 2010,” in which a doctor complained that plaintiff failed to follow 

[ABANDON]
<line: 33> 8 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> orders to discontinue a morphine pump and change the patient’s surgical dressing. 
<line: 3> Plaintiff argues that she followed “standard hospital procedure when leaving the 
<line: 4> dressing on and PCA pump connected,” and she refers vaguely to “other nurses 
<line: 5> [who] performed the same actions, but were not disciplined.” The “standard hospital 
<line: 6> procedure” to which plaintiff refers is the hospital’s policy of “accommodat[ing] 
<line: 7> patients and their requests, especially if [the requests are] related to making the 
<line: 8> patient feel more comfortable, so long as doing so d[oes] not endanger the patient’s 
<line: 9> health.” But, be that as it may, the reason Kelly gave plaintiff for issuing the oral 
<line: 10> warning was that the doctor who issued the order was upset and wanted the nurse 
<line: 11> responsible to be reprimanded. Plaintiff appears not to have tried to confirm or 
<line: 12> contradict this story by deposing this doctor, nor has she presented other evidence 
<line: 13> showing that the doctor was not the true motivating reason. At the same time, 
<line: 14> plaintiff does not deny that she failed to remove the pump and change the dressing 
<line: 15> in the morning as the order required. Accordingly, no factfinder could see pretext in 
<line: 16> this instance. 

[TEXT]
<line: 18> The next basis for termination was the “Written Reminder for Work 
<line: 19> Performance on January 14, 2011.” Plaintiff allegedly ordered a patient care 
<line: 20> technician to (1) assist a physician with a thoracentesis procedure, and (2) “set up 
<line: 21> suction in a room for another patient.” Both of these tasks were beyond the 
<line: 22> technician’s scope of practice. Plaintiff is also alleged to have made records in one of 
<line: 23> these patient’s charts concerning a procedure she was not present for. While 
<line: 24> plaintiff denies ordering the technician to perform either of these tasks, such a 

[ABANDON]
<line: 26> 9 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> denial is not enough to show pretext in this case. A plaintiff can show pretext by, 
<line: 3> among other things, demonstrating that an articulated reason for an adverse action 
<line: 4> had no basis in fact. See Davis v. Con-way Tranp. Central Express, Inc., 368 F.3d 
<line: 5> 776, 784 (7th Cir. 2004). But plaintiff admitted in her deposition that a technician 
<line: 6> was present for the thoracentesis procedure, she acknowledged she asked a 
<line: 7> technician to obtain the suction equipment (though not to set it up), and she offers 
<line: 8> no evidence contradicting the claim that she inappropriately made entries in the 
<line: 9> patient’s chart. Thus, even if Kelly had it wrong in thinking plaintiff directed the 
<line: 10> technicians as claimed, Kelly’s belief was not so baseless so as to suggest pretext. 
<line: 11> Finally, although plaintiff is free to contradict her prior unsworn statements at 
<line: 12> summary judgment, her signed response to the Employee Corrective Action Report 
<line: 13> specifically stated that plaintiff “asked the PCT [patient care technician] (Angela) if 
<line: 14> she could assist Dr. Kemp by turning [the] patient over to her side.” It also stated 
<line: 15> that plaintiff “felt comfortable with [this] decision.” Plaintiff does not attempt to 
<line: 16> explain the contradiction between this statement and her position in litigation.   

[TEXT]
<line: 18> The third reason for plaintiff’s termination was the “Written Reminder for 
<line: 19> Behavior on July 28, 2011,” which involved three separate incidents all occurring 
<line: 20> that same month. Plaintiff attacks this basis by pointing to defendant’s policy of 
<line: 21> notifying employees immediately about any performance issues. Plaintiff says 
<line: 22> defendant failed to follow its own policy when it did not address the events of July 9, 
<line: 23> 13, or 20, until July 28th. However, as defendant correctly points out, the 

[ABANDON]
<line: 25> 10 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> undisputed evidence shows that plaintiff was actually notified right after each 
<line: 3> incident. See [45] at 13; [46] ¶ 28.  

[TEXT]
<line: 5> Plaintiff also argues that none of her alleged behavior in any of these July 
<line: 6> incidents truly violated defendant’s rules. That is not the question, though. See 
<line: 7> Balance v. City of Springfield, 424 F.3d 614, 621 (7th Cir. 2005) (“[Courts] do not sit 
<line: 8> as a super-personnel department with authority to review an employer’s business 
<line: 9> decision as to whether someone should be fired or disciplined because of a work-rule 
<line: 10> violation.”). Defendant has set forth undisputed evidence showing that, in each of 
<line: 11> the three instances, Kelly learned of complaints made against plaintiff consisting of 
<line: 12> conduct that violated the rules. This information served as the non-discriminatory 
<line: 13> basis of Kelly’s decision to reprimand plaintiff. Plaintiff presents no evidence 
<line: 14> showing that Kelly knew these complaints were false or that Kelly’s reliance on 
<line: 15> these complaints (true or false) was otherwise pretext.  

[TEXT]
<line: 17> The final basis for plaintiff’s termination were the events of September 21, 
<line: 18> 2011, in which plaintiff allegedly confronted a patient and discontinued her use of a 
<line: 19> morphine pump as retaliation. Plaintiff seeks to undermine this basis by asserting 
<line: 20> that Kelly failed to check whether plaintiff was simply following the doctor’s order 
<line: 21> to discontinue the morphine pump. This fact alone, however, is insufficient to 
<line: 22> enable a trier of fact to find that defendant’s explanation is pretextual. At most, 
<line: 23> Kelly’s failure to check suggests “an oddity or an error”—not a lie. What is more, 
<line: 24> plaintiff fails to address the charge that she confronted the patient, which Kelly 
<line: 25> confirmed by interviewing the patient and “all the parties involved.”  

[ABANDON]
<line: 27> 11 

[TEXT]
<line: 2> In sum, a trier of fact could not find that defendant's proffered explanations
<line: 3> were pretextual. Summary judgment is therefore granted in favor of defendant on.
