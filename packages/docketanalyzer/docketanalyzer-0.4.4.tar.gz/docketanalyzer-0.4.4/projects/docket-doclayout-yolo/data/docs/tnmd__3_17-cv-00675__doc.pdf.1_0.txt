[TEXT]
<line: 2> 18. Contrary to Defendants' representations, Defendants required Plaintiffs to work without.
<line: 3> any pay and, when questioned about pay, enforced this requirement through threats of criminal
<line: 4> and immigration charges, mental and emotional abuse, and a pattern of mental and legal coercion..
<line: 5> 19.  During Plaintiffs' respective employments, they were required by Defendants to engage

<line: 14> had been violating the notary public duties by failing to keep a record of the notarizations, and not
<line: 15> submitting documents to government. Plaintiff Pantoja still refused. Defendants retaliated against
<line: 16> Plaintiff Pantoja's refusal by lowering her wage by $2.00 per hour.

<line: 21> newspaper in Tennessee, seeking payment for a contract in Plaintiff Pantoja's name. When
<line: 22> Plaintiff Pantoja challenged this conduct with Defendant Perez, Defendant Perez became angry,
<line: 23> threatened and berated Plaintiff Pantoja, and expressed that Defendants could legally use her name
<line: 24> however they pleased.

<line: 23> and Plaintiff Barragan threatening legal action against them for libel and slander and demanding
<line: 24> compensation. These letters were on letterhead of Gestoria Bolanos and were signed by Bridget
<line: 25> Bolanos. The letters were intended to convey that Gestoria Bolanos is a law firm and that Bridget.
<line: 26> Bolanos is an attorney. On information and belief, Gestoria Bolanos is not a law firm and neither

<line: 16> Defendants should have paid her $1,317.25. Defendants never paid Plaintiff Pantoja any.
<line: 17> compensation for any of the hours she worked. During her employment, Defendants also required
<line: 18> Plaintiff Pantoja to pay for office supplies out of her own pocket and did not reimburse her.

[TEXT]
<line: 24> 54. Defendants have told separately each Plaintiff Barragan and Plaintiff Pantoja that
<line: 25> Defendants do not need to pay Plaintiffs because Plaintiffs quit or were fired. Defendants
<line: 26> previously told Plaintiffs that they would not pay overtime wages but required that Plaintiffs work
<line: 27> overtime hours.

[TEXT]

<line: 10> compensable time they were employed in excess of forty (40) hours in each workweek.

[TEXT]
<line: 12> 59. Defendants' failures to pay the Plaintiffs the federally-mandated hourly minimum wage
<line: 13> and the federally-mandated overtime wage rate for all time they were employed in excess of forty
<line: 14> (40) hours in a workweek were willful violations of the FLSA within the meaning of 29 U.S.C.
<line: 15> $255(a). The violations of the FLSA also include the Defendants' failure to reimburse Plaintiffs
<line: 16> Pantoja and Barragan for expenses the workers incurred which were primarily for the benefit of
<line: 17> the Defendants.

[TEXT]
<line: 19> 60.  As a consequence of the Defendants' violations of the FLSA, the Plaintiffs are entitled to

[TEXT]
<line: 2> 63. Defendants' retaliatory behavior towards Plaintiffs includes, but is not limited to,
<line: 3> suspending Plaintiffs without pay, withholding wages, threatening reductions in pay, harassing
<line: 4> Plaintiffs, firing Plaintiffs, and making comments and legal threats intended to intimidate Plaintiffs
<line: 5> from asserting their protected rights, and constitutes retaliation in violation of 29 USC  215(a)(3).

[TEXT]
<line: 7> 64. Defendants retaliated against Plaintiffs in response to their respective complaints to
<line: 8> Defendants about not being compensated for work and overtime, questioning of the legality of
<line: 9> Defendants' business practices, and other protected activities. In response to Plaintiffs' complaints
<line: 10> about pay and questioning of potentially unlawful work activities, Defendants terminated
<line: 11> Plaintiffs' respective employments. Defendants also threatened to report Plaintiff Barragan to

<line: 13> Pantoja's husband to immigration. Defendants may have, in fact, filed and withdrawn a police
<line: 14> report against Plaintiff Pantoja for theft. Defendants also retaliated by sending Plaintiffs emails,
<line: 15> texts, calls, and other messages threatening legal action and demanding compensation for
<line: 16> fraudulently alleged harms.

[TEXT]
<line: 18> 65. Defendants retaliated against Plaintiff Pantoja's protected refusal to engage in unlawful
<line: 19> conduct, such as improper document notarization, by lowering her hourly wage from $11.00 to
<line: 20> $9.00 per hour after initially trying to coerce her into engaging in said conduct.

[TEXT]
<line: 22> 66. Defendants unlawfully threatened each Plaintiff with fraudulent legal demand letters
<line: 23> from a non-existent law firm. The letters contended that Plaintiffs had committed slander, libel,
<line: 24> and defamation by posting true statements on Facebook regarding Defendants failure to pay wages
<line: 25> and Plaintiffs' opinions regarding Defendants' business. The letters included demands that
<line: 26> Plaintiffs remove all related statements, cease all future statements, pay Defendants' "attorney's
<line: 27> fees and costs," and submit an unqualified apology and retraction to Defendants. These claims are

<line: 2> intended to harm Plaintiffs and constitute retaliation under the FLSA, and the request for
<line: 3> "attorney's fees and costs' constitutes extortion in violation of state and federal law. These
<line: 4> fraudulent threat letters were intended to harass and harm Plaintiffs into relinquishing their
<line: 5> statutory speech rights under 29 USC 157 and to punish Plaintiffs for continuing to demand their.
<line: 6> paychecks and other protected conduct.

[TEXT]
<line: 8> 67. Plaintiffs' complaints about not receiving wages constitute protected activity under the
<line: 9> FLSA. Plaintiff Pantoja's refusal to engage in illegal activity and Plaintiff Pantoja's and Plaintiff.
<line: 10> Barragan's respective questioning of the legitimacy of their required work activities constitute
<line: 11> protected activity under the FLSA.

[TEXT]
<line: 13> 68. Plaintiffs have experienced mental anguish and emotional distress as a result of.
<line: 14> Defendants' retaliatory conduct.

<line: 14> 74. Plaintiffs' Complaint serves an important public policy purpose in that Defendant
<line: 15> operates a business falsely and fraudulently creating, converting, and selling Mexican and U.S
<line: 16> government documents and licenses. This business is a threat to public safety by providing these
<line: 17> fraudulent documents to unknown individuals, allowing individuals to obscure their identities,

<line: 19> from the opportunity running background checks on these individuals..
