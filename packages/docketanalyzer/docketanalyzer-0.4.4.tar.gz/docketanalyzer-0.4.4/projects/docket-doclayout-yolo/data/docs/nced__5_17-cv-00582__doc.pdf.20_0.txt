<line: 15> On February 5, 2019, Magistrate Judge Numbers issued a Memorandum and Recommendation
<line: 16> (M&R") [D.E. 19] and recommended that plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings [D.E. 12]
<line: 17> be granted, that defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings [D.E. 15] be denied, and that the
<line: 18> action be remanded to the Commissioner. Neither party objected to the M&R.

[TEXT]
<line: 20> The Federal Magistrates Act requires a district court to make a de novo determination of those
<line: 21> portions of the magistrate judge's report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which
<line: 22> objection is made. Diamond v. Colonial Life & Accident Ins. Co., 416 F.3d 310, 315 (4th Cir. 2005)
<line: 23> (emphasis, alteration, and quotation omitted); see 28 U.S.C.  636(b). Absent a timely objection, "a
<line: 24> district court need not conduct a de novo review, but instead must only satisfy itself that there is no
<line: 25> clear error on the face of the record in order to accept the recommendation." Diamond, 416 F.3d at
<line: 26> 315 (quotation omitted).

<line: 30> at *4-5 (4th Cir. Jan. 15, 2019). Accordingly, the court adopts the conclusions in the M&R [D.E. 19].

<line: 3> judgment on the pleadings [D.E. 15] is DENIED, and the action is REMANDED to the Commissioner
<line: 4> pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  405(g).
