<line: 33> EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA 

[TEXT]
<line: 35> Lena Ann Stonecipher asserts she is entitled to benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act. 
<line: 36> Plaintiff argues the administrative law judge erred finding Plaintiff can perform her past relevant work 
<line: 37> and work existing in significant numbers in the national economy.  Because the ALJ failed to resolve a 
<line: 38> conflict between the vocational expert’s testimony and the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, the 
<line: 39> administrative decision is REMANDED for further proceedings.   

[TITLE]
<line: 41> PROCEDURAL HISTORY 

[TEXT]
<line: 43> On January 14, 2014, Plaintiff filed an application for disability insurance benefits, alleging 
<line: 44> disability beginning June 30, 2011.  (Doc. 7-6 at 2)  The Social Security Administration denied the 
<line: 45> applications at the initial level and upon reconsideration.  (See generally Doc. 7-4)  Plaintiff requested a 
<line: 46> hearing, and testified before the ALJ on May 15, 2016.  (Doc. 7-3 at 17)  At that time, the ALJ also 
<line: 47> obtained testimony a vocational expert.  (See id.)  On June 20, 2016, the ALJ issued an order finding 
<line: 48> Plaintiff was not disabled as defined by the Social Security Act.  (Doc. 7-3 at 17-24)  Plaintiff requested

<line: 32> (Id. at 2-7)  Therefore, the ALJ’s determination became the final decision of the Commissioner of 
<line: 33> Social Security (“Commissioner”). 

[TITLE]
<line: 35> STANDARD OF REVIEW 

[TEXT]
<line: 37> District courts have a limited scope of judicial review for disability claims after a decision by 
<line: 38> the Commissioner to deny benefits under the Social Security Act.  When reviewing findings of fact, 
<line: 39> such as whether a claimant was disabled, the Court must determine whether the Commissioner’s 
<line: 40> decision is supported by substantial evidence or is based on legal error. 42 U.S.C. § 405(g).  The ALJ’s 
<line: 41> determination that the claimant is not disabled must be upheld by the Court if the proper legal standards 
<line: 42> were applied and the findings are supported by substantial evidence.  See Sanchez v. Sec’y of Health & 
<line: 43> Human Serv., 812 F.2d 509, 510 (9th Cir. 1987). 

[TEXT]
<line: 45> Substantial evidence is “more than a mere scintilla.  It means such relevant evidence as a 
<line: 46> reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.”  Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 
<line: 47> 389, 401 (1971) (quoting Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197 (1938)).  The record as a whole 
<line: 48> must be considered, because “[t]he court must consider both evidence that supports and evidence that 
<line: 49> detracts from the ALJ’s conclusion.”  Jones v. Heckler, 760 F.2d 993, 995 (9th Cir. 1985).   

[TITLE]
<line: 51> DISABILITY BENEFITS 

[TEXT]
<line: 53> To qualify for benefits under the Social Security Act, Plaintiff must establish she is unable to 
<line: 54> engage in substantial gainful activity due to a medically determinable physical or mental impairment 
<line: 55> that has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.  42 U.S.C. 
<line: 56> § 1382c(a)(3)(A).  An individual shall be considered to have a disability only if: 

[TEXT]
<line: 58> his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only 
<line: 59> unable to do his previous work, but cannot, considering his age, education, and work 
<line: 60> experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the 
<line: 61> national economy, regardless of whether such work exists in the immediate area in 
<line: 62> which he lives, or whether a specific job vacancy exists for him, or whether he would be 
<line: 63> hired if he applied for work.  

[TEXT]
<line: 65> 42 U.S.C. § 1382c(a)(3)(B).  The burden of proof is on a claimant to establish disability.  Terry v. 
<line: 66> Sullivan, 903 F.2d 1273, 1275 (9th Cir. 1990).  If a claimant establishes a prima facie case of disability,

[TITLE]
<line: 33> ADMINISTRATIVE DETERMINATION 

[TEXT]
<line: 35> To achieve uniform decisions, the Commissioner established a sequential five-step process for 
<line: 36> evaluating a claimant’s alleged disability. 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520, 416.920(a)-(f).  The process requires 
<line: 37> the ALJ to determine whether Plaintiff (1) engaged in substantial gainful activity during the period of 
<line: 38> alleged disability, (2) had medically determinable severe impairments (3) that met or equaled one of the 
<line: 39> listed impairments set forth in 20 C.F.R. § 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1; and whether Plaintiff (4) had 
<line: 40> the residual functional capacity to perform to past relevant work or (5) the ability to perform other work 
<line: 41> existing in significant numbers at the state and national level.  Id.  The ALJ must consider testimonial 
<line: 42> and objective medical evidence.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527, 416.927.   

[TEXT]
<line: 44> Pursuant to this five-step process, the ALJ determined Plaintiff did not engage in substantial 
<line: 45> gainful activity after the alleged onset date of June 30, 2011.  (Doc. 7-3 at 19)  At step two, the ALJ 
<line: 46> found Plaintiff’s severe impairments included: “lupus; radial nerve injury of the right forearm; 
<line: 47> degenerative disc disease of the lumbar and cervical spine; rheumatoid arthritis; and status post trigger 
<line: 48> release surgery of the right hand.”  (Id.)  At step three, the ALJ determined Plaintiff did not have an 
<line: 49> impairment, or combination of impairments, that met or medically equaled a Listing.  (Id. at 20)  Next, 
<line: 50> the ALJ determined: 

[TEXT]
<line: 52> [T]he claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform light work as defined in 
<line: 53> 20 CFR 404.1567(b) except she can perform occasional, but not constant work with the 
<line: 54> right, upper extremity. 

[TEXT]
<line: 56> (Id. at 21)  Based upon this RFC and the vocational expert’s testimony, the ALJ determined at step 
<line: 57> four that Plaintiff was “capable of performing past relevant work as a surgery coordinator.”  (Id. at 22)  
<line: 58> The ALJ made an alternative finding at step five that “there are other jobs that exist in significant 
<line: 59> numbers in the national economy that the claimant can also perform,” such as mailroom clerk, office 
<line: 60> helper, and storage facility clerk.  (Id. at 23)  Consequently, the ALJ concluded Plaintiff was not 
<line: 61> disabled as defined by the Social Security Act.  (Id. at 24)

<line: 63> DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

[TEXT]
<line: 65> Plaintiff asserts the ALJ erred in relying upon the testimony of the vocational expert at steps

<line: 33> Plaintiff contends the ALJ’s “error is material.”  (Id.)  Defendant does not address whether the 
<line: 34> testimony conflicts with the Dictionary of Occupational Titles. (See generally Doc. 14)

<line: 36> A. 
<line: 37> ALJ’s Steps Four and Five Findings 

[TEXT]
<line: 39> A claimant has the burden at step four of the sequential analysis to prove that she cannot 
<line: 40> perform her past relevant work “either as actually performed or as generally performed in the national 
<line: 41> economy.”  Lewis v. Barnhart, 281 F.3d 1081, 1083 (9th Cir. 2002).  Past relevant work is work 
<line: 42> performed in the last 15 years that lasted long enough to learn it, and was substantial gainful 
<line: 43> employment. SSR 82-61, 1982 SSR LEXIS 31.1  The ALJ is not required to make “explicit findings at 
<line: 44> step four regarding a claimant’s past relevant work both as generally performed and as actually 
<line: 45> performed.”  Pinto v. Massanari, 249 F.3d 840, 845 (9th Cir. 2001).  The Ninth Circuit explained, 
<line: 46> “[a]lthough the burden of proof lies with the claimant at step four, the ALJ still has a duty to make the 
<line: 47> requisite factual findings to support his conclusion.”  Id. at 844.

<line: 49> To determine whether a claimant retains the capacity for past relevant work, the Social Security

<line: 51> Administration identified three tests:

<line: 53> 1.  Whether the claimant retains the capacity to perform a past relevant job based on a 
<line: 54> broad generic, occupational classification of that job, e.g., “delivery job,” “packing 
<line: 55> job,” etc. 
<line: 56> 2.  Whether the claimant retains the capacity to perform the particular functional 
<line: 57> demands and job duties peculiar to an individual job as he or she actually performed it.  
<line: 58> 3.   Whether the claimant retains the capacity to perform the functional demands the job

<line: 61> SSR 82-61, 1982 SSR LEXIS 31, at *2-3.  To determine how a claimant actually performed her work, 
<line: 62> an ALJ may consider: “(1) the claimant’s own testimony, and (2) a properly completed vocational 
<line: 63> report.”  Lewis v. Barnhart, 281 F.3d 1081, 1083 (9th Cir. 2002), citing Pinto, 249 F.3d at 845, accord.

<line: 33> Occupational Titles, and vocational expert testimony may be considered at step four of the analysis.  
<line: 34> Pinto v. Massanari, 249 F.3d 840, 845-46 (9th Cir. 2001) (emphasis added).   

[TEXT]
<line: 36> At step five, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to show that Plaintiff can perform other 
<line: 37> substantial gainful activity and a “significant number of jobs exist in the national economy” which 
<line: 38> Plaintiff can perform.  Kail v. Heckler, 722 F.2d 1496, 1498 (9th Cir. 1984); see also Osenbrock v. 
<line: 39> Apfel, 240 F.3d 1157, 1162 (9th Cir. 2001) (discussing the burden shift at step five).  To make this 
<line: 40> determination, the ALJ may rely upon job descriptions in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles 
<line: 41> (“DOT”), which classifies jobs by their exertional and skill requirements, and is published by the 
<line: 42> United States Department of Labor, Employment & Training Administration.  Terry v. Sullivan, 903 
<line: 43> F.2d 1273, 1276 (9th Cir. 1990); 20 C.F.R. § 404.1566(d)(1).  In the alternative, the ALJ may call a 
<line: 44> vocational expert “to testify as to (1) what jobs the claimant, given his or her functional capacity, would 
<line: 45> be able to do; and (2) the availability of such jobs in the national economy.”  Tackett v. Apfel, 180 F.3d 
<line: 46> 1094, 1101 (9th Cir. 1999); see also Social Security Ruling (“SSR”) 00-4p2, 2000 WL 1898704 at *2 
<line: 47> (“In making disability determinations, we rely primarily on the DOT . . . for information about the 
<line: 48> requirements of work in the national economy.”) 

[TEXT]
<line: 50> The ALJ called upon vocational expert Susan Creighton-Clavel (“the VE”) to testify regarding 
<line: 51> Plaintiff’s past relevant work and “determine the extent to which [Plaintiff’s] limitations erode the 
<line: 52> unskilled light occupational base.”  (See Doc. 7-3 at 23, 56) The VE classified Plaintiff’s past relevant 
<line: 53> work as a dental assistant, DOT 079.361-018, and surgery coordinator/hospital admitting clerk, DOT 
<line: 54> 205.362-018.  (Id. at 57-58)  The VE explained that for Plaintiff’s work as a surgery coordinator, the 
<line: 55> VE “used the DOT code for hospital admitting clerk,” because it was “the closest thing in the DOT” to 
<line: 56> a surgery coordinator. (Id. at 58) Under the DOT, this position was classified as semi-skilled and

<line: 58> 2 Social Security Rulings are “final opinions and orders and statements of policy and interpretations” issued by the

<line: 34> The VE testified a person with these limitations could perform the hospital coordinator position.  (Id.)  
<line: 35> In addition, the VE testified the individual could perform other “light, unskilled jobs” in the national 
<line: 36> economy, including mail room clerk, DOT 209.687-026; office helper, DOT 239.567-010; and storage

<line: 39> The ALJ inquired whether the VE’s testimony was consistent with the Dictionary of 
<line: 40> Occupational Titles, and she responded “[p]retty much.”  (Doc. 7-3 at 63)  The VE explained: “They 
<line: 41> don’t address absences.  They don’t address these combinations.  They don’t address less than eight 
<line: 42> hours of work.  They don’t address sitting and standing at certain time frames.  That looks like about it.  
<line: 43> And, of course, my responses would be -- based on my training and experience.”  (Id.)  The ALJ then 
<line: 44> asked the VE to identify her training and experience, and she responded that she had “a master’s of 
<line: 45> science degree in counseling,” and she was “a certified rehab counselor and a certified disability 
<line: 46> management specialist.”  (Id. at 63-64)  In addition, Ms. Creighton-Clavel testified that she had been 
<line: 47> doing “expert witness work for the Social Security Administration since the 80’s.”  (Id. at 64)

<line: 52> Pursuant to SSR 00-4p, occupational evidence provided by a vocational expert “generally 
<line: 53> should be consistent with the occupational information supplied by the DOT.”  Id., 2000 WL 1898704 
<line: 54> at *2.  When there is a conflict between the testimony of the vocational expert and the Dictionary of 
<line: 55> Occupational Titles, “the adjudicator must elicit a reasonable explanation for the conflict before 
<line: 56> relying on the [vocational expert testimony] to support a determination or decision about whether the 
<line: 57> claimant is disabled.”  Id. Further, SSR 00-4p provides: 

[TEXT]
<line: 59> At the hearings level, as part of the adjudicator’s duty to fully develop the record, the

<line: 62> Neither the DOT nor the [vocational expert] evidence automatically “trumps” when there

<line: 34> 1. 
<line: 35> Whether there is a conflict 

[TEXT]
<line: 37> The ALJ determined Plaintiff could “perform occasional, but not constant work with the right, 
<line: 38> upper extremity,” and asked the vocational expert to consider this limitation.  (Doc. 7-3 at 21, 58)  
<line: 39> Based upon the vocational expert’s testimony, the ALJ concluded at step four that Plaintiff was 
<line: 40> “capable of performing past relevant work as a surgery coordinator.”3  (Id. at 22, 24) At step five, the 
<line: 41> ALJ found Plaintiff could also work as a mailroom clerk, DOT 209.687-026; office helper, DOT 
<line: 42> 239.567-010; and storage facility clerk, DOT 295.367-026.  (Id. at 23-24) The ALJ asserted, “Pursuant 
<line: 43> to SSR 00-4p, the undersigned has determined that the vocational expert’s testimony is consistent with 
<line: 44> the information contained in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles.”  (Id. at 24) However, as Plaintiff 
<line: 45> observes, “[t]he past work and the other work identified by the vocational expert require frequent use of 
<line: 46> the upper extremities for reaching, handling, and fingering.”  (Doc. 11 at 9) 

[TEXT]
<line: 48> Under the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, the position of hospital admitting clerk— which 
<line: 49> the vocational expert used for Plaintiff’s past work as a surgery coordinator (Doc. 7-3 at 58) — is 
<line: 50> classified as sedentary work, which can require an individual to exert “up to 10 pounds of force 
<line: 51> occasionally … and/or a negligible amount of force frequently…to lift, carry, push, pull, or otherwise 
<line: 52> move objects, including the human body.”  DOT 205.362-018, 1991 WL 671710.  The position also 
<line: 53> indicates a person may be required to frequently reach, handle, and feel objects.  (Id.)  Similarly, each 
<line: 54> of the representative positions identified above require frequent reaching, handling, and fingering.  See 
<line: 55> DOT 209.687-026, 1991 WL 671813 (mailroom clerk); DOT 239.567-010, 1991 WL 672232 (office 
<line: 56> helper); DOT 295.367-026, 1991 WL 672594 (storage facility clerk).  Because the jobs identified by 
<line: 57> the vocational expert require the ability to use arms on frequent basis, while the ALJ limited Plaintiff to 
<line: 58> occasional use with the right arm, the Court finds the testimony of the vocational expert conflicts with 
<line: 59> the Dictionary of Occupational Titles.  See SSR 83-10, 1983 WL 31251 at *5-6 (explaining

<line: 62> performed or as actually performed.

<line: 35> Whether the record supports the deviation 

[TEXT]
<line: 37> When there is a conflict between the testimony of a vocational expert and the Dictionary of 
<line: 38> Occupational Titles, the Court may rely upon the testimony only when “the record contains persuasive 
<line: 39> evidence to support the deviation.”  Massachi, 486 F.3d at 1153.  Importantly, there is no indication in 
<line: 40> the record that the ALJ was aware of the conflict between Plaintiff’s limitations with her right arm and 
<line: 41> and the requirements of the jobs as defined by the Dictionary of Occupational Titles. 

[TEXT]
<line: 43> Although the vocational expert acknowledged some conflicts between her testimony and the 
<line: 44> Dictionary of Occupational Titles, she did not address the conflict between Plaintiff’s limitations to 
<line: 45> “occasional but not constant” use of the right arm and the frequent reaching, handling, or fingering 
<line: 46> requirements of both her past relevant work and the other positions.  As a result, the ALJ was unable to 
<line: 47> resolve the conflict between the two vocational resources, as is required by the Ninth Circuit.  See 
<line: 48> Johnson, 60 F.3d at 1435; Pinto v. Massanari, 249 F.3d 840, 845 (9th Cir. 2001) (“in order for the ALJ 
<line: 49> to rely on a job description in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles that fails to comport with a 
<line: 50> claimant’s noted limitations, the ALJ must definitively explain this deviation”). Because the ALJ did 
<line: 51> not address the apparent conflict, and the vocational expert did not explain her reasoning, the record 
<line: 52> cannot support the deviation.

<line: 54> C. 
<line: 55> Remand is Appropriate  

[TEXT]
<line: 57> The decision whether to remand a matter pursuant to sentence four of 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) or to 
<line: 58> order immediate payment of benefits is within the discretion of the District Court.  Harman v. Apfel, 
<line: 59> 211 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir. 2000).  Except in rare instances, when a court reverses an administrative 
<line: 60> agency determination, the proper course is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or 
<line: 61> explanation.  Moisa v. Barnhart, 367 F.3d 882, 886 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing INS v. Ventura, 537 U.S. 

[TEXT]
<line: 63> 12, 16 (2002)).  Generally, an award of benefits is directed when: 

[TEXT]
<line: 65> (1) the ALJ has failed to provide legally sufficient reasons for rejecting such evidence, 
<line: 66> (2) there are no outstanding issues that must be resolved before a determination of 
<line: 67> disability can be made, and (3) it is clear from the record that the ALJ would be required 
<line: 68> to find the claimant disabled were such evidence credited.

[TEXT]
<line: 35> The ALJ failed to address the apparent conflicts between the vocational expert’s testimony and 
<line: 36> the Dictionary of Occupational Titles.  Based upon the record, the Court is unable to determine whether 
<line: 37> Plaintiff is able to perform work existing in significant numbers in the national economy. Accordingly, 
<line: 38> a remand for further proceedings is appropriate in this matter.  See Zavalin v. Colvin, 778 F.3d 842, 848 
<line: 39> (9th Cir. 2015) (an ALJ’s failure to reconcile apparent conflict was not harmless where the Court 
<line: 40> “cannot determine [from the record] whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ’s step-five 
<line: 41> finding”); see also Dieugenio v. Astrue, 2010 WL 317269 at *3 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 19, 2010) (holding that 
<line: 42> where the expert claimed that his testimony was consistent with information in the Dictionary of 
<line: 43> Occupational Titles but a review of the descriptions “reveal[ed] a conflict with respect to the jobs 
<line: 44> identified,” failure to address the conflict warranted a remand for further proceedings). 

[TITLE]
<line: 46> CONCLUSION AND ORDER 

[TEXT]
<line: 48> For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes the ALJ erred by failing to address the apparent 
<line: 49> conflict between the testimony of the vocational expert and the Dictionary of Occupational Titles.  
<line: 50> Because the ALJ failed to apply the correct legal standards, the testimony of the vocational expert 
<line: 51> cannot support the conclusion that Plaintiff is able to perform her past relevant work or other work in 
<line: 52> the national economy.  See Zavalin, 778. F.3d at 846; Rawlings v. Astrue, 318 Fed. Appx. 593, 595 
<line: 53> (2009) (“Only after determining whether the vocational expert has deviated from the Dictionary of 
<line: 54> Occupational Titles and whether any deviation is reasonable can an ALJ properly rely on the vocational 
<line: 55> expert’s testimony as substantial evidence to support a disability determination.”)  Consequently, the 
<line: 56> ALJ’s decision cannot be upheld by the Court.  See Sanchez, 812 F.2d at 510.   

[TEXT]
<line: 58> Because the Court finds remand is appropriate on these grounds, it offers no findings on the 
<line: 59> remaining argument presented in Plaintiff’s opening brief. 

[TEXT]
<line: 61> Based upon the foregoing, the Court ORDERS: 

[TEXT]
<line: 63> 1. 
<line: 64> The matter is REMANDED pursuant to sentence four of 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) for further 
<line: 65> proceedings consistent with this decision; and
