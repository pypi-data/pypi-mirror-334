<line: 4> I.
<line: 5> PROCEDURAL HISTORY

[TEXT]
<line: 7> Plaintiff protectively filed an application for DIB on
<line: 8> March 2, 2004, alleging disability since August 1, 2001, due to a
<line: 9> right hand injury, C8 radiculopathy and depression.  ®. 24, 63-
<line: 10> 65.)  The Social Security Administration denied Plaintiff’s
<line: 11> claim, and Plaintiff requested a hearing before an administrative
<line: 12> law judge (“ALJ”).  ®. 27-31.)  

[TEXT]
<line: 14> A hearing was held on June 16, 2005, and Plaintiff, who
<line: 15> was not represented by counsel, appeared and testified.  ®. 274-
<line: 16> 305.)  An impartial vocational expert (“VE”) also appeared and
<line: 17> testified.  ®. 300-303.)  On August 22, 2005, the ALJ determined
<line: 18> that Plaintiff was not disabled at any time  because she
<line: 19> 3
<line: 20> maintained the residual functional capacity to perform a
<line: 21> significant range of light work.  ®. 17-25.)  Based on her RFC
<line: 22> determination, as well as Plaintiff’s age, education, and work
<line: 23> experience, the ALJ found that there are jobs that exist in
<line: 24> significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff was
<line: 25> capable of performing.  ®. 24, Finding Nos. 5-11.)  Thus, the ALJ
<line: 26> concluded that Plaintiff was not disabled.  ®. 25, Finding No.
<line: 27> 12.)

[TEXT]
<line: 29> On October 17, 2005, having obtained counsel to represent

[ABANDON]
<line: 31>  The ALJ found that Plaintiff’s right hand injury with residual C8
<line: 32> 3
<line: 33> radiculopathy and depression were severe impairments, but that her impairments
<line: 34> did not meet or equal one of the listed impairments in Appendix 1, Subpart P,
<line: 35> Regulation No. 4.  Further, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was unable to perform
<line: 36> any of her past relevant work, that she had the RFC to perform a significant
<line: 37> range of light work, and that there were a significant number of jobs in the
<line: 38> national economy that she could perform.  ®. 24-25.)

<line: 5> 13.)  On April 24, 2006, Plaintiff’s counsel submitted to the
<line: 6> Appeals Council additional records of mental health treatment
<line: 7> that Plaintiff underwent starting on July 6, 2005.  ®. 241-273). 
<line: 8> On May 22, 2006, the Appeals Council denied Plaintiff’s request
<line: 9> for review.  ®. 6-9.)  Thus, the ALJ’s decision became the final
<line: 10> decision of the agency.  Plaintiff initiated this civil action on
<line: 11> July 24, 2006, seeking judicial review of the Commissioner’s
<line: 12> decision that she was able to perform a significant range of
<line: 13> light duty work, and thus was not entitled to SSI.  The matter
<line: 14> was referred to this Magistrate Judge on February 20, 2007, for
<line: 15> preparation of a report and recommendation.

<line: 20> Plaintiff, born on December 17, 1967, was thirty-three
<line: 21> years old at the time of her alleged disability and thirty-six
<line: 22> years old  at the time of her application for benefits.  ®. 63.)

[ABANDON]
<line: 30>   Because Plaintiff qualified as a “younger person” under the

<line: 32> regulations, her age is not considered a significant impediment to adapting to
<line: 33> new work situations.  20 C.F.R. § 416.963(b)(2000).  The Court must
<line: 34> “cautiously scrutinize the employment prospects of so young an individual
<line: 35> before placing him on the disability rolls.”  Lockley v. Barnhart, No. 05-

<line: 11> III.
<line: 12> LEGAL STANDARD

[TEXT]
<line: 14> The role of this Court on judicial review is to
<line: 15> determine whether there is substantial evidence in the
<line: 16> administrative record to support the Commissioner's final
<line: 17> decision.
<line: 18>  Any findings of fact made by the Commissioner must be
<line: 19> accepted as conclusive, provided that they are supported by
<line: 20> substantial evidence. 42 U.s.C. S 405(g). "Substantial
<line: 21> evidence" is deemed to be such relevant evidence as a reasonable
<line: 22> mind might accept as adequate to support a decision.

<line: 24> v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 407 (1971), guoting Consolidated Edison
<line: 25> Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938). See als0, Williams v.

[TEXT]
<line: 29> The ALJ must consider all relevant evidence in the
<line: 30> record and provide some indication of the evidence she rejected
<line: 31> and why she rejected it. See Adorno v. Shalala, 40 F.3d 43, 48
<line: 32> (3d Cir. 1994); Cotter v. Harris, 642 F.2d 700, 704 (3d Cir.
<line: 33> 1981). When determining whether the ALJ's decision is supported
<line: 34> by substantial evidence, the court may look to any evidence in.

<line: 6> (E.D. Pa. Feb. 24, 2000).  Thus, the issue before this Court is
<line: 7> whether the Commissioner’s final decision of “not disabled”
<line: 8> should be sustained as being supported by substantial evidence.  

[TEXT]
<line: 10> Moreover, apart from the substantial evidence inquiry,
<line: 11> a reviewing court must also ensure that the ALJ applied the
<line: 12> proper legal standards in evaluating a claim of disability. 
<line: 13> Coria v. Heckler, 750 F.2d 245 (3d Cir. 1984).  

[TEXT]
<line: 15> To prove disability, a claimant must demonstrate that
<line: 16> there is some “medically determinable basis for an impairment
<line: 17> that prevents him from engaging in any ‘substantial gainful
<line: 18> activity’ for a statutory twelve-month period.”  42 U.S.C. §
<line: 19> 423(d)(1).  Each case is evaluated by the Commissioner according
<line: 20> to a five-step process:

[TEXT]
<line: 22> The sequence is essentially as follows:  (1)
<line: 23> if the claimant is currently engaged in
<line: 24> substantial gainful employment, []he will be
<line: 25> found not disabled; (2) if the claimant does
<line: 26> not suffer from a “severe impairment,” []he
<line: 27> will be found not disabled; (3) if a severe
<line: 28> impairment meets or equals a listed
<line: 29> impairment in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P,
<line: 30> Appendix 1 and has lasted or is expected to
<line: 31> last continually for at least twelve months,
<line: 32> then the claimant will be found disabled; (4)
<line: 33> if the severe impairment does not meet prong
<line: 34> (3), the Commissioner considers the
<line: 35> claimant’s residual functional capacity
<line: 36> (“RFC”) to determine whether []he can perform
<line: 37> work []he has done in the past despite the
<line: 38> severe impairment - if []he can, []he will be
<line: 39> found not disabled; and (5) if the claimant
<line: 40> cannot perform [his] past work, the
<line: 41> Commissioner will consider the claimant’s

[TITLE]
<line: 12> IV.     ALJ DECISION AND PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR REMAND

[TEXT]
<line: 14> Plaintiff’s alleged disability primarily involves an
<line: 15> inability to work due to a right hand injury, C8 radiculopathy
<line: 16> and depression.  ®. 24.)  The ALJ, however, proceeded through the
<line: 17> sequential evaluation process and found Plaintiff was not
<line: 18> disabled due to her impairments.  
<line: 19> 5

[TEXT]
<line: 21> In her Request for Remand, Plaintiff asserts that: 1)
<line: 22> the ALJ erred by employing an incomplete and inaccurate
<line: 23> hypothetical question to the vocational expert; 2) new and
<line: 24> material evidence submitted to the Appeals Council confirms the
<line: 25> severity of Plaintiff’s mental impairment; 3) the ALJ erred by
<line: 26> failing to conduct a proper evaluation of Plaintiff’s
<line: 27> credibility; and 4) the ALJ erred by failing to comply with the
<line: 28> affirmative obligation to ask a VE about any possible conflict

[ABANDON]
<line: 30>   The ALJ proceeded through the first four steps, finding that: (1)
<line: 31> 5
<line: 32> Plaintiff has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since her alleged
<line: 33> onset of disability; (2) Plaintiff’s right hand injury, residual C8
<line: 34> radiculopathy and depression are considered “severe”; (3) Plaintiff’s
<line: 35> medically determinable impairments did not meet or medically equal one of the
<line: 36> listed impairments in Appendix 1, Subpart P, Regulation No. 4; and (4)
<line: 37> Plaintiff retains the RFC to perform a significant range of light work.  ®.
<line: 38> 20-24, Finding Nos. 1-3, 5, 10.)  Based on the foregoing, as well as
<line: 39> Plaintiff’s age, education, and work experience, the ALJ concluded at the last
<line: 40> step that there are jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national
<line: 41> economy that Plaintiff was capable of performing.  ®. 24, Finding No. 11.) 
<line: 42> Accordingly, Plaintiff was not disabled at any time through the date last
<line: 43> insured. ®. 25, Finding No. 12.)

<line: 4> between the VE’s testimony and information provided in the DOT. 
<line: 5> (Pl. Br. at 3-13.)  The sole issue before this Court, however, is
<line: 6> whether the Commissioner’s final decision of “not disabled”
<line: 7> should be sustained as being supported by substantial evidence. 
<line: 8> Based upon an independent review of the record  and for the
<line: 9> 6
<line: 10> reasons that follow, we find that although the ALJ’s ultimate
<line: 11> conclusion that Plaintiff is not disabled may be supported by
<line: 12> substantial evidence of record, additional, relevant medical
<line: 13> evidence was presented after the ALJ issued her decision.  As we
<line: 14> find this evidence to be material and because good cause was
<line: 15> shown for Plaintiff’s failure to present this evidence before the
<line: 16> ALJ’s decision was reached, we remand this matter to the ALJ for
<line: 17> further proceedings and evaluation of this new evidence.

[TITLE]
<line: 19> V.     DISCUSSION

[TEXT]
<line: 21> Plaintiff argues that the submission of new and
<line: 22> material medical evidence clarifies and substantiates the
<line: 23> severity of Plaintiff’s mental impairment.  (Pl. Br. at 8.)  The
<line: 24> new evidence in question is records for Plaintiff’s mental health
<line: 25> treatment beginning on July 6, 2005 (prior to the ALJ’s decision
<line: 26> in this matter).  ®. 244-273.)  These records were submitted to
<line: 27> the Appeals Council on April 24, 2006.  ®. 241-243.)  Upon an
<line: 28> independent and thorough review of the record, we find that the

[ABANDON]
<line: 30>   As noted supra, this Court may look to the entire record, not just
<line: 31> 6
<line: 32> the portions the ALJ cited to, in conducting our review.  See  Hook v. Bowen,
<line: 33> 677 F. Supp. 305, 306 (M.D. Pa. 1988); Eposito v. Apfel, 66 Soc.Sec.Rep.Ser.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> additional evidence submitted to the Appeals Council is new and
<line: 5> material evidence that should be examined by the ALJ in
<line: 6> conjunction with the pre-existing evidence of record.  

[TEXT]
<line: 8> This Court has the statutory authority to remand for
<line: 9> further proceedings if new evidence submitted to the Appeals
<line: 10> Council is material and good cause is shown for the failure to
<line: 11> present it on a timely basis.  42 U.S.C. § 405(g); Matthews v.
<line: 12> Apfel, 239 F.3d 589, 592 (3d Cir. 2001).  In order to be
<line: 13> considered “new,” the evidence cannot be merely cumulative of
<line: 14> evidence already in the record, and to be considered “material,”
<line: 15> there must be a reasonable possibility that the new evidence
<line: 16> would have changed the outcome of the Commissioner’s
<line: 17> determination.  Szubak v. Secretary of Health and Human Svcs.,
<line: 18> 745 F.2d 831, 833 (3d. Cir. 1984).  Implicit in the materiality
<line: 19> requirement is that “the new evidence relate to the time period
<line: 20> for which benefits were denied, and that it not concern evidence
<line: 21> of a later-acquired disability or of the subsequent deterioration
<line: 22> of the previously non-disabling condition.”  Id.  

[TEXT]
<line: 24> In the instant case, the new evidence in question is
<line: 25> mental health treatment records of Plaintiff from July 6, 2005,
<line: 26> to March 1, 2006.  ®. 244-273.)  Plaintiff asserts there was good
<line: 27> cause for her to submit her mental health records at the Appeals
<line: 28> Council stage of review because Plaintiff was unrepresented at
<line: 29> the hearing in this case, advised the ALJ about her past mental
<line: 30> health treatment, and told the ALJ she was having trouble getting

<line: 4> back into treatment because of issues with her insurance.  ®.
<line: 5> 277, Pl. Br. at 9.)  Further, the ALJ advised Plaintiff at the
<line: 6> close of the hearing that she (the ALJ) would request Plaintiff’s
<line: 7> mental health records, but failed to advise Plaintiff that the
<line: 8> ALJ had not received any such records regarding her mental health
<line: 9> care, despite requesting them.  (Pl. Br. at 9.)  Due to the fact
<line: 10> that Plaintiff was not represented by counsel at the hearing in
<line: 11> this matter and because of her unstable mental state, we find
<line: 12> that the facts support Plaintiff’s contention that good cause
<line: 13> existed for submission of her mental health records at the
<line: 14> Appeals Council stage of review.  

[TEXT]
<line: 16> The administrative hearing was held on June 16, 2005;
<line: 17> on August 22, 2005, the ALJ issued an unfavorable decision.  ®.
<line: 18> 17-25.)  Meanwhile, Plaintiff sought further medical treatment
<line: 19> for her mental condition.   ®. 244-273.)  On October 17, 2005,
<line: 20> 7
<line: 21> Plaintiff, now represented by counsel, submitted a timely request
<line: 22> for review of the ALJ’s decision to the Appeals Council.  ®. 12.) 
<line: 23> On March 28, 2006, the Appeals Council sent a letter to
<line: 24> Plaintiff’s attorney in which it provided him with copies of
<line: 25> exhibits from the ALJ hearing and a copy of the recording from

[ABANDON]
<line: 27>  On July 6, 2005, Plaintiff underwent a psychological evaluation at
<line: 28> 7
<line: 29> Community Council for MH/MR, Inc.  (R. 244-251.)  This initial assessment,
<line: 30> which was completed prior to the date of the ALJ’s decision, found that
<line: 31> Plaintiff had auditory/visual hallucinations, depressed mood and anxiety, all
<line: 32> of which rated a 3 on a scale of 1 to 3, in which a 3 is defined as “severe.” 
<line: 33> (R. 251.)  Plaintiff was also diagnosed with a schizo affective disorder with
<line: 34> depressed mood.  (R. 251.)  On July 22, 2005, also prior to the date of the
<line: 35> ALJ’s decision, Plaintiff underwent an initial evaluation with David Frankel,
<line: 36> M.D.  (R. 252.)  Dr. Frankel found that Plaintiff’s depression and psychosis
<line: 37> were rated a 3 on a scale of 1 to 3, which again indicated that these
<line: 38> conditions were “severe.”  (R. 255.)

<line: 8> August 22, 2005.”  ®. 10.)  On April 24, 2006, Plaintiff
<line: 9> specifically requested that the Appeals Council review
<line: 10> Plaintiff’s claim in light of additional medical evidence, which
<line: 11> Plaintiff attached to her request.   ®. 241-273.)  However, on
<line: 12> 8
<line: 13> May 22, 2006, the Appeals Council denied Plaintiff’s request for
<line: 14> review.  ®. 6-9.) 

[TEXT]
<line: 16> In analyzing Plaintiff’s new medical evidence, we first
<line: 17> find that Plaintiff’s mental health records from Community
<line: 18> Council for MH/MR, Inc. (“Community”) are “new,” and not merely
<line: 19> cumulative of evidence already in the record.  These records
<line: 20> reflect that Plaintiff had a GAF score of 50 in July of 2005, and
<line: 21> demonstrate the ongoing changes in Plaintiff’s mental health
<line: 22> functioning.  ®. 255.)  Further, the records are evidence of the
<line: 23> severity of Plaintiff’s mental problems and her ongoing emotional
<line: 24> difficulties.  Therefore, we find that these records are not
<line: 25> merely cumulative of evidence already existing in the record.

[TEXT]
<line: 27>  We further find that Plaintiff’s new evidence is
<line: 28> material because it relates to Plaintiff’s mental health
<line: 29> condition, is probative of the severity of her condition and
<line: 30> relates to the time period at issue.  This new evidence
<line: 31> corroborates the opinion of the Consulting Examiner, Dr. Siegel,

[ABANDON]
<line: 33>   Plaintiff’s additional medical evidence consisted of treatment
<line: 34> 8
<line: 35> records from Community Council for MH/MR, Inc., from July 6, 2005, to March 1,
<line: 36> 2006.  ®. 241-273.)

<line: 4> with regard to the severity of Plaintiff’s mental condition, and
<line: 5> corroborates the Plaintiff’s credibility, as the evidence
<line: 6> consistently rates her mental health problems as 3 on a scale of
<line: 7> 1 to 3, or “severe.”  ®. 255.)  Further, the ALJ based her
<line: 8> decision in part upon the fact that Plaintiff had not obtained
<line: 9> any mental health treatment since leaving prison.  ®. 21.)  Based
<line: 10> upon a review of this new evidence, this statement of the ALJ is
<line: 11> clearly incorrect, as the new evidence shows that Plaintiff
<line: 12> continued to undergo treatment for her mental health problems
<line: 13> after the date of the ALJ hearing.  

[TEXT]
<line: 15> Moreover, there is a reasonable probability that this
<line: 16> evidence would change the outcome of the Commissioner’s decision,
<line: 17> as these new records are further evidence of the severity of
<line: 18> Plaintiff’s mental problems.   Specifically, the ALJ found that
<line: 19> 9
<line: 20> although Plaintiff’s depression was “severe,” it was not “severe”
<line: 21> enough to meet or medically equal, either singly or in
<line: 22> combination with other impairments, one of the listings in
<line: 23> Appendix 1, Subpart P, Regulation No. 4.  ®. 20.)  An examination
<line: 24> of Plaintiff’s new medical evidence could result in Plaintiff’s
<line: 25> impairment being severe enough to meet the criteria of the
<line: 26> relevant listing.   

[TEXT]
<line: 28> Lastly, good cause justifies Plaintiff’s failure to
<line: 29> present these mental health treatment records at the ALJ hearing,
<line: 30> because Plaintiff did not begin treatment at Community until July

[ABANDON]
<line: 32>  The ALJ found that Plaintiff had mild restriction in activities of
<line: 33> 9
<line: 34> daily living, mild difficulties with social functioning, and moderate
<line: 35> difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence and pace.  (R. 21-21.)

<line: 4> 6, 2005, over three weeks after the hearing in this case.  ®. 18-
<line: 5> 25, 263-264.)  Further good cause exists because Plaintiff was
<line: 6> unrepresented at the ALJ hearing, and was told by the ALJ that
<line: 7> the ALJ would obtain Plaintiff’s mental health treatment records. 
<line: 8> As she was unrepresented, it was reasonable for Plaintiff to
<line: 9> assume that the ALJ would obtain the records relevant to
<line: 10> Plaintiff’s mental health treatment.  In addition, there is
<line: 11> absolutely no evidence that Plaintiff intentionally withheld the
<line: 12> records of Community from the ALJ.  See Szubak at 834 (finding it
<line: 13> significant that there was no evidence of an attempt by plaintiff
<line: 14> to withhold medical evidence from the ALJ.)  Thus, there is good
<line: 15> cause why Plaintiff’s new evidence was not previously presented
<line: 16> to the ALJ.  Consequently, remand to the Commissioner to consider
<line: 17> this new and material evidence is necessary.  

[TEXT]
<line: 19> Because this new and material evidence would likely
<line: 20> impact each area of the ALJ’s decision which Plaintiff now
<line: 21> challenges, namely the accuracy of the hypothetical question to
<line: 22> the VE, whether the ALJ conducted a proper evaluation of
<line: 23> Plaintiff’s credibility, and whether the ALJ failed to comply
<line: 24> with the obligation imposed by Social Security Ruling 00-4p, the
<line: 25> effect of this additional medical evidence should be re-examined
<line: 26> by the Commissioner on remand.
