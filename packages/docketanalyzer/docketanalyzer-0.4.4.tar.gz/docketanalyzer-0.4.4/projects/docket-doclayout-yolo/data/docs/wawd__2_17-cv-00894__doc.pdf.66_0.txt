[TEXT]
<line: 46> The following Minute Order is made by direction of the Court, the Honorable 
<line: 47> Thomas S. Zilly, United States District Judge: 

[TEXT]
<line: 49> (1) 
<line: 50> Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, docket no. 33, is DENIED.  
<line: 51> Summary judgment is “disfavored” in trademark infringement cases, but “may be entered 
<line: 52> when no genuine issue of material fact exists.”  Surfvivor Media, Inc. v. Survivor Prods., 
<line: 53> 406 F.3d 625, 630 (9th Cir. 2009).  The parties dispute material facts relevant to the 
<line: 54> issues of liability and damages in this action for trademark infringement and unfair 
<line: 55> competition, making summary judgment improper.  See AMF, Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats, 
<line: 56> 599 F.2d 341, 348-49 (9th Cir. 1979) (establishing flexible eight-factor test for likelihood 
<line: 57> of confusion in trademark disputes).   

[TEXT]
<line: 59> (2) 
<line: 60> Defendants’ Motion to Exclude the Testimony of Catherine Carr, docket 
<line: 61> no. 34, is DENIED in part and GRANTED in part.  Plaintiff describes two topics on 
<line: 62> which Carr will testify: (1) the strength of the Ekobrew mark and brand and (2) ARM’s 
<line: 63> selection of the Eko or Eco marks.  The Court is satisfied that with respect to the first 
<line: 64> topic, strength of the Ekobrew mark, Carr’s specialized knowledge will help the trier of 
<line: 65> fact understand the evidence and determine facts in issue, is based on sufficient facts or 
<line: 66> data, is the product of reliable principles and methods, and that Carr has reliably applied

<line: 26> the principles and methods to the facts of this case.  Daubert v. Merrell Dow 
<line: 27> Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993); United States v. Hankey, 203 F.3d 1160, 
<line: 28> 1168-69 (9th Cir. 2000) (applying Daubert factors to non-scientific expert); see also 
<line: 29> Messick v. Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., 747 F.3d 1193, 1196 (9th Cir. 2014) (noting 
<line: 30> that although Rule 702 “should be applied with a liberal thrust favoring admission . . . it 
<line: 31> requires that expert testimony be both relevant and reliable”) (internal quotation marks, 
<line: 32> alterations, and citations omitted).  That Carr did not conduct consumer surveys or 
<line: 33> perform a consumer study as part of her report does not warrant exclusion of her 
<line: 34> testimony.  Comm. For Idaho’s High Desert, Inc. v. Yost, 92 F.3d 814, 822 (9th Cir. 
<line: 35> 1996) (observing that consumer surveys are probative evidence, but are not required to 
<line: 36> prove likelihood of confusion).  Carr based her opinion on a combination of her 
<line: 37> experience in brand development and management and on a review of the competing 
<line: 38> products’ websites and social media accounts, product reviews, internet search analytics, 
<line: 39> and by asking various retailers about their reusable, single-serve coffee products.  Carr 
<line: 40> Report, docket no. 35-1, ¶ 10.  In light of these facts and data, the Court does not 
<line: 41> conclude there is “simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion 
<line: 42> proffered.”  General Electric v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 146 (1997).  To the extent there are 
<line: 43> gaps or limitations in Carr’s analysis regarding the strength of the marks, those issues go 
<line: 44> to the weight—not the admissibility—of her testimony.  With respect to the second 
<line: 45> topic—ARM’s selection of various marks—the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion.  
<line: 46> Plaintiff has not demonstrated that Carr’s conclusions on this topic are based on sufficient 
<line: 47> facts or data or are the product of reliable principles or methods.  On this topic, the 
<line: 48> analytical gap between ARM’s decisionmaking process—which Carr did not observe—
<line: 49> and Carr’s conclusions is “simply too great.”  Joiner, 522 U.S. at 146.
