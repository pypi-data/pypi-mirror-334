[TITLE]
<line: 19> COURT ACTION: EO: COURT ORDER RULING ON DEFENDANTS’ MOTION
<line: 20> FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

[TEXT]
<line: 22> On August 28, 2020, Defendants Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as
<line: 23> Trustee for American Home Mortgage Assets Trust 2007-3, Mortgage-Backed Pass-
<line: 24> Through Certificates Series 2007-3; Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC; and Homeward
<line: 25> Residential, Inc., formerly known as American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc. (collectively
<line: 26> “Defendants”) filed their Motion for Summary Judgment (“Motion”).  [Dkt. no. 125.] 
<line: 27> Plaintiff Luis C. Chavez, Individually and as Special Administrator of the Estate of Macario
<line: 28> Araujo Chavez (“Plaintiff”), filed his memorandum in opposition to the Motion on
<line: 29> September 25, 2020, and Defendants filed their reply on October 2, 2020.  [Dkt. nos. 134,
<line: 30> 135.]  The Motion came on for hearing on October 16, 2020.  

[TEXT]
<line: 32> The parties are hereby informed that the Motion is GRANTED, and summary
<line: 33> judgment is GRANTED in favor of Defendants as to all of Plaintiff’s claims.  The Court’s
<line: 34> rulings include, but are not limited to:

[TEXT]
<line: 36> 1)
<line: 37> The claim brought by Plaintiff in his individual capacity (“Plaintiff Individually”)
<line: 38> alleging unfair and deceptive acts and practices, in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. § 480-2,
<line: 39> fails because: the majority of the events that the claim is based upon are time-barred; see
<line: 40> Haw. Rev. Stat. § 480-24; and the timely events do not constitute unfair or deceptive acts
<line: 41> or practices, see Hungate v. Law Office of David B. Rosen, 139 Hawai`i 394, 410-11, 391
<line: 42> P.3d 1, 17-18 (2017) (describing when an act or practice is unfair or deceptive).

[TEXT]
<line: 44> 2)
<line: 45> The claim by Plaintiff Individually alleging violations of the Fair Debt Collection
<line: 46> Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1692, et seq., fails because he failed to present sufficient
<line: 47> evidence to raise a triable issue of fact as to the alleged violations of either 15 U.S.C.
<line: 48> §§ 1692d, 1692e, or 1692f(6).

[TEXT]
<line: 50> 3)
<line: 51> The claim brought by Plaintiff on behalf of the Estate of Macario Araujo Chavez
<line: 52> (“the Estate” and “Plaintiff as Administrator”) alleging breach of contract fails because

[TEXT]
<line: 4> Macario Araujo Chavez and the Estate breached the loan contract, and therefore Plaintiff as
<line: 5> Administrator cannot enforce the loan contract through a breach of contract claim. See
<line: 6> Furuya v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Pac. Monarch, Inc., 137 Hawai`i 371, 385, 375
<line: 7> P.3d 150, 164 (2016).

[TEXT]
<line: 9> 4)
<line: 10>  The claims by Plaintiff as Administrator for promissory estoppel and conversion fail.
<line: 11> because those are equitable claims, and the Estate had adequate legal remedies available to
<line: 12> it. See Porter v. Hu, 116 Hawai`i 42, 55, 169 P.3d 994, 1007 (Ct. App. 2007) (stating "the
<line: 13> absence of an adequate remedy at law'' is a "necessary prerequisite'' to bring a suit for an
<line: 14> equitable remedy (citation and quotation marks omitted)).

[TEXT]
<line: 16> 5)
<line: 17>  The claim by Plaintiff Individually alleging intentional interference with prospective
<line: 18> economic advantage fails because Plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to raise a
<line: 19> triable issue of fact as to the state of mind or motive required for this claim. See Meridian
<line: 20> Mortg., Inc. v. First Hawaiian Bank, 109 Hawai`i 35, 48, 122 P.3d 1133, 1146 (Ct. App.
<line: 21> 2005) ("The plaintiff must prove that the defendant either pursued an improper objective of
<line: 22> harming the plaintiff or used wrongful means that caused injury in fact. Asserting one's..
<line: 23> rights to maximize economic interests does not create an inference of ill will or improper
<line: 24> purpose." (citation omitted)).

[TEXT]
<line: 26> 6)
<line: 27> The quiet title claim by Plaintiff as Administrator fails because the Estate no longer
<line: 28> holds title to the property at issue in this case. See Maui Land & Pineapple Co. v. Infiesto,
<line: 29> 76 Hawai`i 402, 408, 879 P.2d 507, 513 (1994) (stating a plaintiff in a quiet title action.
<line: 30> "must at least prove that he has a substantial interest in the property and that his title is
<line: 31> superior to that of the defendants" (citation omitted)).

[TEXT]
<line: 33> 7)
<line: 34> ... The fraud claim by Plaintiff Individually fails because Plaintiff has not identified
<line: 35> sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact as to the elements of fraud. See Fisher v.
<line: 36> Grove Farm Co., 123 Hawai`i 82, 103, 230 P.3d 382, 403 (Ct. App. 2009) (listing the
<line: 37> elements of a fraud claim). Even if there are issues of fact as to whether Defendants made
<line: 38> false representations, Plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue as to the question of
<line: 39> whether his reliance on those representations caused the injuries that he bases this claim
<line: 40> upon.

[TEXT]
<line: 42> 8)
<line: 43> The intentional infliction of emotional distress ("IIED') claim by Plaintiff.
<line: 44> Individually fails because Plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence of causation to raise.
<line: 45> a triable issue of fact. See Young v. Allsate Ins. Co., 119 Hawai`i 403, 429, 198 P.3d 666,
<line: 46> 692 (2008) (stating the elements of an IIED claim).

[TEXT]
<line: 48> 9)
<line: 49> The negligent infliction of emotional distress ("NIED') claim by Plaintiff
<line: 50> Individually fails because Plaintiff has not presented any evidence that he or anyone else
<line: 51> suffered physical injuries. See Doe Parents No. 1 v. State, Dep't of Educ., 100 Hawai`i 34,
<line: 52> 69-70, 58 P.3d 545, 580-81 (2002). Further, even if Plaintiff was allowed to supplement
<line: 53> the summary judgment record to include evidence of the treatment that Plaintiff's counsel
<line: 54> referred to during the hearing on the Motion, Plaintiff's NIED claim would fail for a lack of.

[TEXT]
<line: 4> causation.  See id. (stating the physical injury must have been caused “by the defendant’s
<line: 5> conduct”).

[TEXT]
<line: 7> 10)
<line: 8> Finally, the claim by Plaintiff as Administrator alleging violations of the Real Estate
<line: 9> Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”), 12 U.S.C. § 2601, et seq., fails because: the
<line: 10> majority of the events that the claim is based upon are time-barred; see 12 U.S.C. § 2614;
<line: 11> and, as to events that are arguably within the actionable period, Plaintiff has failed to
<line: 12> present sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact regarding any letter he sent on
<line: 13> behalf of the Estate that constitutes a qualified written request and that Defendants failed to
<line: 14> respond to, see 12 U.S.C. § 2605(e).

[TEXT]
<line: 16> Thus, there are no genuine issues of material fact for trial, and Defendants are
<line: 17> entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to all of Plaintiff’s claims.  See Fed. R. Civ. P.
<line: 18> 56(a).  A written order will follow that will supersede these rulings.  If Plaintiff wishes to
<line: 19> file a motion for reconsideration, he must wait until the written order is filed to do so.

[TEXT]
<line: 21> IT IS SO ORDERED.
