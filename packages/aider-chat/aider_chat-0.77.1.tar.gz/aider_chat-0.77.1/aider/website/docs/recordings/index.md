# Screen recordings

Below are a series of screen recordings of the aider developer using aider
to enhance aider.
They contain commentary that describes how aider is being used,
and might provide some inspiration for your own use of aider.

- [Add --auto-accept-architect feature](./auto-accept-architect.html) - See how a new command-line option is added to automatically accept edits proposed by the architect model, with implementation. Aider also updates the project's HISTORY file.

- [Add language support via tree-sitter-language-pack](./tree-sitter-language-pack.html) - Watch how aider adds support for tons of new programming languages by integrating with tree-sitter-language-pack. Demonstrates using aider to script downloading a collection of files, and using ad-hoc bash scripts to have aider modify a collection of files.

- [Don't /drop read-only files added at launch](./dont-drop-original-read-files.html) - Follow along as aider is modified to preserve read-only files specified at launch when using the /drop command. Aider does this implementation and adds test coverage.
