# Selenium Chrome Pool

A Python library for managing Selenium Chrome connections, designed to prevent excessive page loads causing crashes and provide connection pool management.

## Features

*   **Connection Pool Management:** Limits the maximum number of Chrome instances to prevent excessive resource usage.
*   **Idle Connection Cleanup:** Automatically closes connections that have been idle for a long time, releasing resources.
*   **Thread-Safe:** Supports concurrent access from multiple threads.
*   **Headless Mode:** Supports running Chrome in headless mode.
*   **Remote WebDriver:** Supports connecting to a remote Selenium Grid or standalone-chrome container.
*   **Automatic Cleanup:** Automatically closes all connections when the program exits.

## Installation

```bash
pip install selenium_chrome_pool  # (If published to PyPI)
# Or, for local installation:
pip install .
```

## Prerequisites

```
Selenium is installed: pip install selenium
Chrome WebDriver (ChromeDriver) is installed. Ensure the ChromeDriver version is compatible with your Chrome browser version and add it to your PATH environment variable, or specify its path when using SeleniumChromePool. (ChromeDriver is not required if using a remote WebDriver)
```

## Usage

```python
from selenium_chrome_pool import SeleniumChromePool
import threading
import time

# 1. Create a connection pool
# remote_url = "http://192.168.1.100:4444/wd/hub"  # Remote Selenium Grid address (optional)
remote_url = None  # Use local chromedriver
pool = SeleniumChromePool(max_connections=3, headless=True, remote_url=remote_url)
pool.start_cleanup_thread()  # Start the cleanup thread (must be called)

# 2. Get a connection from the pool
def worker(task_id):
    driver = pool.get_connection()
    if driver:
        try:
            driver.get("https://www.baidu.com")
            print(f"Task {task_id}: Page title: {driver.title}")
            time.sleep(5)  # Simulate task execution time
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Task {task_id}: Error: {e}")
        finally:
            # 3. Release the connection
            pool.release_connection(driver)
    else:
        print(f"Task {task_id}: Failed to get connection.")


# Simulate multiple concurrent tasks
threads = []
for i in range(5):  # Simulate 5 concurrent tasks
    t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(i,))
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

for t in threads:
    t.join()

time.sleep(5)  # Wait for a while to observe if the cleanup thread works
# pool.close_all_connections()  # No need to call manually, atexit will handle it

print("Program finished")
```

**Important Notes:**

*   Make sure to call `start_cleanup_thread()` before using `SeleniumChromePool` to start the idle connection cleanup thread.  This is crucial for proper resource management.
*   Call `release_connection()` after using the connection to return it to the pool.
*   You don't need to manually call `close_all_connections()` when the program exits. The `atexit` module will automatically close all connections.

## Parameter Descriptions

*   `max_connections`: The maximum number of connections in the pool (default: 5).
*   `max_idle_time`: The maximum idle time for a connection in seconds (default: 300). Connections that have been idle for longer than this time will be cleaned up.
*   `headless`: Whether to run Chrome in headless mode (default: True).
*   `chrome_options`: A `selenium.webdriver.chrome.options.Options` instance for configuring Chrome options (optional).
*   `remote_url`: The remote URL of the Selenium Grid or standalone-chrome (optional). If not provided, the local ChromeDriver will be used.  Example: `"http://192.168.1.100:4444/wd/hub"`

## Error Handling

If a connection cannot be retrieved from the pool, the `get_connection()` method will return `None`.  Make sure to check if the connection is valid before using it.
