# Lilypad

An open-source LLM engineering platform built on these principles:

- Building with LLMs introduces non-determinisim to your code, which requires...
- Tracking all input/output pairs and the exact version of the code that produced them so you can...
- Continuously evaluate and optimize your code, which requires...
- Involving business users and domain experts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> __Lilypad is still in beta__
>
> This means that things like the user interface, database schemas, etc. are still subject to change. We do not yet recommend fully relying on this project in production, but we've found it works quite well in its current stage.
>
> If you're interested in participating in the closed beta of Lilypad Pro, [join our community](https://join.slack.com/t/mirascope-community/shared_invite/zt-2ilqhvmki-FB6LWluInUCkkjYD3oSjNA) and DM William Bakst :)
>
> We also welcome contributions with open arms! If you're interested in [contributing](https://github.com/Mirascope/lilypad/tree/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), just do it! We're here to help.

## Quickstart

To get started with Lilypad:

1. Create an account at <https://app.lilypad.so>. You can also [run Lilypad locally](https://lilypad.so/self-hosting) if you'd prefer.
2. Navigate to [your organization settings](https://app.lilypad.so/settings/org)
3. Create a project, and then create an API key for that project.
    a. Save your `LILYPAD_PROJECT_ID` and `LILYPAD_API_KEY` (e.g. in a `.env` file).
4. Install Lilypad: `uv add "python-lilypad[openai]"  # specify your provider of choice`
5. Run your first generation:

```python
import os

import lilypad
from openai import OpenAI  # use your provider of choice

os.environ["LILYPAD_PROJECT_ID"] = "..."
os.environ["LILYPAD_API_KEY"] = "..."
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "..."

lilypad.configure()    # Automatically trace LLM API calls
client = OpenAI()


@lilypad.generation()  # Automatically version non-deterministic functions
def answer_question(question: str) -> str | None:
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Answer this question: {question}"},
        ],
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content


answer = answer_question("What is the capital of France?")
print(answer)
# > The capital of France is Paris.
```

And that's it! Now you've versioned and traced your first non-deterministic function with Lilypad.
