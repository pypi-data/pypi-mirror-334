    Attributes:
        content_to_rewrite (str): Enter the text content you want to be rewritten Example: Protocol Buffers, also known
            as protobuf, is a method for serializing structured data. It's developed by Google and is used extensively
            within Google for communication between internal services and for data storage. It's designed to be language-
            neutral, platform-neutral, and extensible. At its core, Protocol Buffers defines a language-independent,
            platform-neutral format for serializing structured data. It allows you to define the structure of your data in a
            language-neutral way using a simple interface description language (IDL), and then generate code in various
            programming languages to easily serialize and deserialize data in that format. Key features of Protocol Buffers
            include: Language Independence: You can define your data structures in a .proto file using Protocol Buffers'
            Interface Definition Language (IDL), and then use code generation tools to generate code in multiple programming
            languages. This makes it easy to work with structured data across different programming languages and platforms.
            Efficiency: Protocol Buffers uses a binary serialization format that is more compact and efficient compared to
            text-based formats like JSON or XML. This results in smaller message sizes, faster serialization and
            deserialization, and reduced network and storage overhead. Extensibility: Protocol Buffers supports schema
            evolution, allowing you to evolve your data schema over time without breaking backward compatibility. You can
            add new fields, remove existing fields, and make other changes to your data schema while ensuring that older
            clients can still read messages serialized with the newer schema. Cross-Platform Support: Protocol Buffers
            supports a wide range of programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, Go, and more. This makes it easy to
            integrate Protocol Buffers into your existing projects and work with structured data across different platforms.
            Overall, Protocol Buffers provides a flexible, efficient, and language-independent way to serialize structured
            data, making it ideal for use cases such as inter-service communication, data storage, and API serialization..
        output_language (Optional[RewriteRequestOutputLanguage]): Language preference for output if not the same as
            input Example: German.
        detect_input_language (Optional[bool]): Detect the language input and either return the rewrite in the same
            language or a different language
        total_words (Optional[int]): The total count of words in the output text. If not populated, model will determine
            appropriate length Example: 30.0.
        example (Optional[str]): A sample of rewritten content that helps identify appropriate style and tone
        temperature (Optional[float]): Determines the level of creativity applied to the output. A value of 0 indicates
            minimal creativity, sticking closely to the original content, while a value of 1 encourages maximum creativity,
            potentially introducing more novel rephrasings. Adjust this setting based on how closely you want the output to
            adhere to the input.
        rewrite_instructions (Optional[str]): Style guidelines for rewrite. This should be concise and focus on things
            like tone, audience, purpose, etc. Example: Rewrite in a more engaging and informative style, using simpler
            terms and focusing on key insights..
