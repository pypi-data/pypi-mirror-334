# **FastPyX** ðŸš€  

**FastPyX** is a **high-performance C extension** for Python, designed to **optimize memory usage** and significantly improve execution speed.  

## **Why FastPyX?**  
ðŸ”¥ **Faster** than Python's built-in list for `fappend` operations  
ðŸ“‰ **Uses up to 56% less memory** than Python lists  
âš¡ **Ideal for high-performance applications** requiring optimized data structures  

## **Features**  
- ðŸš€ Written in **C** for extreme performance  
- ðŸ“Œ Optimized `FastList` implementation (efficient `fappend` method)  
- ðŸ”¹ **Supports multiple data types** seamlessly  
- ðŸ”§ **Efficient memory allocation** to reduce fragmentation  

## **Benchmark Results**  
| Operation | FastList | Python List | Speedup | Memory Usage (10M items) |  
|-----------|---------|-------------|---------|--------------------------|  
| `fappend` | **0.56s** | 0.67s | ðŸ”¥ **17% Faster** | **30.5MB (FastList) vs. 69MB (Python List)**  

âœ… **FastList is both faster and more memory-efficient than Python's built-in list!**  

## **Installation**  
```sh
pip install fastpyx
```

## **Future Roadmap**  
âœ… Advanced memory management optimizations for **Django and other frameworks**  
âœ… Additional **performance improvements** for lists, dictionaries, and sets  
âœ… More Pythonic API and integration with **NumPy/Pandas**
