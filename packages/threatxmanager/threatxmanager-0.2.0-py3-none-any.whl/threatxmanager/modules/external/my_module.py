    """
    MyModule for Remote File Access Exploitation on Veritas Backup Exec Windows Agent.

    This module exploits a logical flaw in the Backup Exec Windows Agent to download arbitrary files
    from the system. The vulnerability, discovered by an anonymous researcher, affects all known versions
    of the Backup Exec Windows Agent. The output file is in MTF format, which can be extracted using
    the NTKBUp tool listed in the references. To transfer an entire directory, specify a path ending with
    a backslash.

    Attributes
