Python package for spherical array processing.

Getting Started
===============

Check out the [example notebooks](https://github.com/pyfar/pyfar/blob/main/examples) - also available on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pyfar/spharpy/main?filepath=examples/) - for a tour of basic functionality and
[read the docs](https://spharpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable) for the complete documentation.

Installation
============

Use pip to install spharpy

    pip install spharpy

(Requires Python 3.8 or higher)

Audio file reading/writing is supported through [SoundFile](https://python-soundfile.readthedocs.io), which is based on
[libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/). On Windows and OS X, it will be installed automatically.
On Linux, you need to install libsndfile using your distributionâ€™s package manager, for example ``sudo apt-get install libsndfile1``.
If the installation fails, please check out the [help section](https://pyfar-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/help).
