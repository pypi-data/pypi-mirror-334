# üêç pytherpreter üêç

A Python interpreter with built-in safeguards for executing untrusted code, like LLM-generated scripts.

This repository contains the Python interpreter tool extracted from HuggingFace‚Äôs [_smolagents_](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) project.
Big hug to the HuggingFace team for their initial implementation! ü§ó

Some improvements over the smolagents tool:
- Supports async code execution using the `async_evaluate` function and `AsyncPythonInterpreter` class.
- Improved function call resolution.
- Supports custom subscriptable objects.
- No external dependencies.
- More flexible `print` handling.

## Installation
```shell
pip install pytherpreter
```

Latest development version:

```shell
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/aremeis/pytherpreter.git
```

or

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/aremeis/pytherpreter.git
```

## Usage

### Using `evaluate`

This function evaluates Python code and returns the result.
```python
from pytherpreter import evaluate

result = evaluate("""
from math import sqrt
sqrt(4)
""")
print(result)

# Output:
# 2.0
```

The `evaluate` function returns the result of the last expression in the code.

### Using `PythonInterpreter`

This class is a wrapper around the `evaluate` function that keeps the state of the interpreter between calls.
Variables and functions defined by the code will be be available in subsequent calls.

```python
from pytherpreter import PythonInterpreter

interpreter = PythonInterpreter()
result = interpreter("x = 3")
print(result)

# Output:
# 3

result = interpreter("x += 1")
print(result)

# Output:
# 4
```

### Printing

You may provide a `stdout` argument to capture the output of print statements in the code.

```python
from pytherpreter import evaluate
import io
stdout = io.StringIO()
result = evaluate("print('Hello, World!')", stdout=stdout)
print(stdout.getvalue())

# Output:
# Hello, World!
```

### Variables

You may provide a `variables` argument to preset variables and capture changes to them.

```python
from pytherpreter import evaluate
variables = {"x": 3}
result = evaluate("x += 1", variables=variables)
print(variables["x"])

# Output:
# 4
```

## Safeguards

### Built-in functions

You may provide a `builtin_functions` argument containing a dictionary of built-in functions the code is allowed to call.
If you don't provide this argument, the code will only be able to call the built-in functions in `BASE_BUILTIN_FUNCTIONS`.

The code will not be able to modify the provided built-in functions.

### Modules

By default, the code will only be able to import the modules in `BASE_BUILTIN_MODULES`.
You may provide an `authorized_imports` argument to allow the code to import additional modules.
