## Typing stubs for google-cloud-ndb

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`google-cloud-ndb`](https://github.com/googleapis/python-ndb) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
[Pyre](https://pyre-check.org/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses `google-cloud-ndb`. This version of
`types-google-cloud-ndb` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`google-cloud-ndb==2.3.*`.

This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).
If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.


This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/google-cloud-ndb`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/google-cloud-ndb)
directory.

This package was tested with
mypy 1.15.0,
pyright 1.1.396,
and pytype 2024.10.11.
It was generated from typeshed commit
[`da50b5c4112bc44dce08685f9e30708b8cb88489`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/da50b5c4112bc44dce08685f9e30708b8cb88489).
