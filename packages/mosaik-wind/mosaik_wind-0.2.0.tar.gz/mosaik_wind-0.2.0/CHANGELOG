- Initial release of the mosaik-wind simulator


0.2.0 - 2025-03-18
------------------

- Refactoring of attributes and parameters: power_curve_csv -> power_curve_file; P_gen -> P[MW].
- The power_curve_file can now be specified during simulator initialization and during model creation. 
- power_factor, power_kw or power_mw can be used as input data for the power curve.
- To calculate a power curve based on power_factor, either rotor_area or max_power_mw is required as input data.
